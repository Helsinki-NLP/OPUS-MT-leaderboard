The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions in ČEZ shares reached about half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of commercial Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday's fall when it fell to about 6%.
The drop this time is due to the fall of the shares on Wall Street.
It also expresses the market's reaction to the outcome of the American Assembly of Representatives vote that refused to support the financial sector secretary's stabilization plan.
Fall of actions in Asia
The shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although throughout the day the index finally attenuated part of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index over its financial day marked almost four percent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that follows the movements of Chinese shares in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The stocks of the Sidney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the Secretary of the Index, fell to 3.6 percent.
"The bailout shares programmed in the U.S. are insecure and this influences the financial market around the world," Hong Kong Bureau Chief Joseph Yam said.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, i.e. without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
American legislators should reconvene as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that falls will be felt in other countries.
Bleeding bath of American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the plan to help the financial system to which $700 billion (about 12 billion) should be devoted.
The legislators, in this way, ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American shares lived a bloody bath and mainly the index of shares picked up the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to almost seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index was already down before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly's proposal did not go forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress withdraws: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
The American legislators caused a gap in the talks on the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of 700 billion dollars (about 12 billion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make the final form of the law public and be voted on.
The financial system support plan will be discussed at the Assembly of Representatives on Monday.
He told the Reuters agency on Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Financial Services and Banking.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, "disenchantment" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market support will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've made a big breakthrough.
We resolved our dissenting views on how the market stabilization package should take place," Democrat Nancy Pelosiá told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of legislators met Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government fund a definitive form.
It should buy from financial corporations unsold mortgage assets that lead financial corporations to severe losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and will also have to be effective on the market.
We still need to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we're already on it," Paulson said.
A sign for Asian business
The global financial crisis has an explicit impact on the market for rapidly decreasing shares.
According to Nevada's Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are doing their utmost to get Congress to finally approve an agreement this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' businesses in the Asian finance market as these are the ones in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday's trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote and, not even, if they do not stall at the last moment with some problem.
The legislators believe it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion have to be available as soon as possible, as called for by President George Bush.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush valued the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to earn financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgages whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying off their mortgages.
"We've worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
American President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's advance and that he values "the commitment of both parties to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armoured contract
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility for the money of the program for the protection of taxpayers' taxes from their losses, a relieving closure of the planned finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armoured contracts for directors of the companies participating in the programme, and set up a committee that would have control of the Fund.
This would have to be run by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made a great deal of progress towards the convention that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also benefits from helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree to the new mortgage payments that it buys in order to lower the monthly charges of the debtors' instalment payments and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological aid
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
"And that's why we don't know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, as relevant.
"The most important thing is that, this week, the congressmen agree on their support and give them their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that this approval should be reached is, at the moment, the most important," Marek insisted.
Armed hand fight: MP3 Player against mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear it's best to buy only the phone.
Still, there are sufficient grounds for man to acquire only the player.
The choice depends practically on the way in which it is used and on the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP discs no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz or blues music are crowded in their shelves, you are probably dreaming, at least, of this type of record player.
This is the same with music that is on the way, that is, compressed music, simplified - music in MP3.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the market helmets of twenty crowns.
Two ends, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is broad.
It also decides the battery life
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even what not even most mobiles do.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most elementary functions such as phone calling, sending messages, you can play music and video, record both, you have a better or worse camera and you can even manage to navigate.
And when we consider the Smartphone and the PDAs will also have a small computer in their pocket.
This is a small miracle as no fridge knows how to make a barbecue and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more the display indicator will be illuminated to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy trains.
Few mobiles are able to play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) clearly have greater performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobile phones will not play more than two hours.
If in addition to this, on top of it, you constantly call still get, for more security, a loader for work - this is also valid for the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem won't have it, as even the worst ones endure at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when you record music on your mobile.
Unfortunately only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, moreover, not all of them can connect directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some unreduced drives can the small memory cards that are used on mobiles be connected.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Simply fill the device with music through the computer's USB.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the performer, album title, genre or also according to the user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you will listen to it every day for just a little while, as on the tram, then enough for you with any mobile that reproduces.
Which practically really gets any mobile.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays the music.
The MP3 plays it all and practically all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most extensive and except for it the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough through the mobile internet to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album.
This service could by itself be a weighty argument for acquiring a mobile for music.
Unfortunately the offer of operators is miserable and the majority is limited only to the themes of fleeting radio success.
Prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (either by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a cell phone.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find your mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always have headphones or, at least, handsfrees.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the absence of a classic headset entrance.
The best, even as far as the technical part is concerned, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm entrance for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - actually handle them by anyone.
The minimal functions, their handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the record player is evident.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, huge data-down account.
Which apparatus to decide on
Even the cheapest mobiles (for example, the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a proper card you will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped only with a maximum capacity 2 GB card.
Only the most expensive ones have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, check out Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) no more than 1,100 crowns need be spent.
If you consider yourself one of the most demanding music lovers, take advantage of the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line mobiles have almost identical use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over the four thousand crowns, but with a greater capacity of memory (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand quoted more arria brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
Probably won't be long.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it in mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTU) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is among the most expensive in the whole Union.
After the European Commission's last steps in the area of roaming charges regulation, a paradoxical situation is likely to arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS messages sent from abroad will be cheaper than if sent from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, as we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
Of this also the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTU), Pavel Dvořák, has already said that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with its own network there is not much chance (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant price decrease to which the classic operators had to react.
At the same time, even before the entrance of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for such operators and that they can succeed.
Otherwise, there is no need to look too far for examples.
In February this year we informed you about the virtual operator Mobilking's debut in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to get more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking there is the Penta group which, apart from this, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of concentrating on many more specific target groups.
In addition, for them to function effectively, they have fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry with them relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators usually profile with low costs - offer cheap calls and SMS messages that however, often contradicts the offer of the most adjusted services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half as cheap with respect to competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows it can be a good hit also the bet for a trivial nothing target group.
This operator is specifically targeting the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - he is the operator who likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept as that of Poland could engage in our country.
Vodafone's spokesman Miroslav Čepický doubted this: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover from the point of view of the supply of services is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic there will be any virtual operator that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech R. does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it's about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region," said Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the financial group Penta, in a telephone conversation for mobil.cz.
Indirectly he assured that the current mobile telephone operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competition arises.
Interest on the launch of a virtual mobile operator already shows it the group GTS Novera who would like to take a step later to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony services.
And the sooner the better.
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have made progress in the meetings," said the group's spokesperson, Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe they'll spark a better time.
It seems that, by unofficial information, the first official operator would possibly have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this field," said for mobil.cz, Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefónica O2.
Other operators refer to the specific nature of the Czech market.
T-mobile's spokesperson, Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with O2's opinion, adds: "To date we have not registered any viable commercial projects that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop."
He adds: "In the network of T-Mobile it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some concrete contract that could be studied in such a short horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this with regard to the sharing of costs and infrastructure.
Precisely we consider it to be the greatest contribution from the point of view of the customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on the mobile."
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition, which would lead to a fall in prices and thus a fall in profits.
Then why facilitate entry into the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull the same rope, proof of it is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on ČTU was at the time of U:fon's entry by T-Mobile society.
This is witnessed by public information available on ČTU's websites.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: "In addition, the competitive environment in the mobile phone market has not long been open to a fourth operator.
As far as the character of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic is concerned, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would mean for him and, above all, for his services great requirements."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical position on this issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile telephone market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile telephone operator and a virtual operator has been concluded.
To date, no agreement has been concluded since the offer of potential stakeholders was not interesting enough for the classical operators," added Kristián Chalupa, of the UOHS Department of External Relations, to our question.
These statements are not surprising to the operators' representatives.
For the offices that must represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, apart from that they must note that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Across the country where virtual operators operate normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the fall in prices of mobile telephony services"
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and the fall in prices does not fall within the interest of UOHS.
Really the dramatic shock in all this case lies in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of petrol in gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office in this regard has found no signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position and therefore do not have a corresponding promotion of responsibility in their actions on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunications regulators," he added to his response Chalupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is obviously a relevant market analysis developed by ČTU, according to which telecommunications is from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market none of the Czech operators naturally has a dominant position.
However some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all his logic - has the monopoly of his network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument were not accepted, at least for UUOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators ascend strikingly in a similar way.
The current complaints from stakeholders (inluded by the above-mentioned GTS Novera company) show that in all negotiations with the operators they clash with many similar impediments.
Loading responsibility in the ČTU is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications of which the UOHS washes its hands in this whole matter.
We've met him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law for the extension of ČTU's competition in the field of commercial tendering was introduced recently, although a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This should be fully known by UOHS representatives, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one looks
At the same time, something like a pseudo-virtual operator that already exists in the Czech mobile networks remains unnoticed.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services which, however, only a part are public.
These are usually multi-level marketing companies.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Normally only some chosen get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit this type of resale.
"If cases such as those cited could be discovered, it would be possible to talk about infringement under the terms of the contract that could be translated into an end to the partnership with the given company," he answered the question about this problem Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
It is precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned above that they can be made up of thousands of customers.
None of the operators is against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they get a not negligible profit and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they do not in any way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible so many percent of customers.
They must also accept that your phone's SIM card is not in your name so they cannot absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of the operators."
This is precisely what should seem to the minimally strange ČTU.
In addition, there is a new question for UOHS.
If mobile operators turn their eyes on this type of procedure, why do they block the virtual operator's entry?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want it should not be content with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this history and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When we stop being the most expensive
As already made clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a significant drop in the prices of services.
At the same time, in virtually all the countries where the virtual operator emerged, classical operators tried to protect themselves more or less from this intrusion.
The arguments used by these were almost all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases have they defended operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure, the first virtual operator emerged and others began to emerge with it.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Authority all of this happens as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot fail to be impressed that the confusion of powers in these cases suits them.
But let's not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator really gets to this land, then the Czech mobile phone market is probably starting to move again.
If any of the operators lets a virtual mobile operator in, it will be difficult for UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one with a male voice and one with a female voice, one with a choir and another with an instrumental voice.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are in charge of the song.
The authors of the anthem arrangements are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
Czech Radio said before that it intentionally chose for Solo singers with voices representatively young who are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with both of them and then, too, with the Choir to fix themselves in the diction so that the text would be well understood, so that it would be consistent," he commented.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home played for the first time in 1834 in the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
He gained popularity and people made it theirs.
The first stanza of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The Prague MHD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the Prague Transport Company's history describes the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased right now by almost a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card at the transport company's infocentres and posts at the Metro, Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka stations.
Bonuses can already be purchased from yesterday on the Internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the Internet as a form of commerce can definitely start forgetting about the ticket sales posts at the subway stations, where so far they had to queue regularly to get a normal ticket.
The bonus is purchased online, and the Opencard card is charged to one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is at the passenger's disposal a window with prepared staff that helps interested people with the purchase over the internet and also with the recharge of the bonus purchased on their card," said the project spokesman, Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to reload the electronic bonus on the Opencard in the vending machines that are located in some subway halls.
How are these vending machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket-picking machine and the travelers will probably have already noticed them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are in the city five but by the end of the year there would have to be eighty", Opatrný added.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter in it the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
The electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
In other words, on the bypass trains and bus lines from the number 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the localities of Central Bohemia.
"In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the bond area," explained the check of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that establishes the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
Circumvalation buses have their reading cards mounted in the driver's locker.
Upon entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany it with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not travel on bypass buses and do not remember when they are finished the validity of the bonus can go to the vending machines where the cards are charged.
Here, on the screen of the machine, you will be shown the information about the validity of your document.
Southeast wanted to join the US in a referendum
In 1945, the German Sudeten asked for smoking to be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire some groups of Germans from the Sudeten were presumably addressed to the President of the United States in 1945.
It comes from the letters that are stored in a particular archive and are today stored in the collection of the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov requested in a letter to the American President that he not allow the return of the "Šumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - again to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want your word that American units are arriving at German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed with a "people who carry the destiny of Šumava in their heart".
In view of the fact that Czechoslovakia's union with the south-eastern Germans presumably represents - according to these, the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors pray in the letter to the American president to assume for today and forever Šumava under a protectorate.
"We can't believe that without considering the opinion of four million people, it gives us a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that at all it collaborates with the victory of the allies," is written in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals by the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States presumably doubted this idea of the Germans šumavos, it would be enough to organize in the lands šumavas a referendum on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the United States or live under their patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of the post-war history, may sound a bit childish, according to some specialists it paints well the expectations of the Germans of the Southeast then.
Although the Czech Germans had to have a minimum sense that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudetes some clear form of autonomy.
Others believed that they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
Even Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
He was in the war, as a German from Budějovice, wrapped in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war the British seized him and placed him in Holstein's prison camp dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that coming home, the Czech would do them good," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted that on the basis of the Bene Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could characterize the emotional campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media.
The minister's office, Aleš İebíček promises to deter drivers from driving dangerous behaviors.
The 150 million campaign will be made available on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and in brochures.
I'd have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol driving.
And also to remind you that before you get started, the belts are held.
It wants to become aware above all of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and ultimately also of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that overwhelm emotions.
And to do this, the "sanguinary" ads attest to us throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" is written with big letters on the plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pay."
This must symbolize that man at a time of sparing can come to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to "fear" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
Promises that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"For drivers the sugar and whip system is worth.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red light is passed and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says the transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital, Martin Kořán.
And that is why an information campaign is needed in the press and mainly negative publicity, concrete the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay any more attention to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
Israel's interim government president, Ehud Olmert, ruled on the restitution of virtually all occupied lands in 1967, namely, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will necessarily have to restore almost all (occupied) land if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll keep a little percent of this land, but we'll have to give the Palestinians a similar percent (of Israel's land) because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the event of restitution Jerusalem would also be included.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out in reference to the two July attacks in the city in which there were several dead and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the hill of the Temple, sacred and historical place" that is located inside the old city.
"Anyone who wants to maintain Israelite sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work," he insisted later.
Withdrawal of the Golan Heights
Olmert also said that Israel had withdrawn from the Golan Heights, which from his point of view was an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to close the peace with Syria just on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to take to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with the Hizbullah (chita movement), they will have to emerge from the ongoing support caused by the terrorism of Hamas (chita movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewardesses illegal on buses?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In relation to the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padova, we have the question of whether passengers and stewardesses can move on the bus during the trip.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the stewardess is opposed to the law of road transit," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place of the vehicle despite having reserved two other places.
However, the bus may have an accident or suddenly brake, and at the very moment when the hostess distributes the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with places on foot.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no standing places, which the company's director, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, this was withdrawn and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat," he told us his position.
The stewardess doesn't know the law
"There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the stewardess - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The law of road transport only knows the term of the vehicle reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds, less sharply, spokesman Hanzelka.
The Director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes, on the contrary, that the law adequately addresses this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have sites on foot.
That's all," he says.
The buses are divided between the urban ones, where there are places to be standing and of limited maximum speed, interurbans with places to be standing with a higher speed permit and those of long distances without places to go standing, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with seat belt.
As on the plane, says the expert
The expert at BESIP in Transport Safety, Jaroslav Hořín, sees no major problems with the movement of the bus hostess.
"During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared with the service on the planes.
Even here you don't have the assurance that the turbulence will come and that the stewardess can hit her in the head."
"However, if the bus suddenly stops, it is obvious that the physical laws are valid.
Same as on an urban bus or on the tram.
The safety of the hostess must be addressed by the carrier's internal regulations," he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the services of stewardess.
It employs two hundred in it.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that work to be risky.
"However, the moment I get the impression that the stewardess position is risky, then I will suppress it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, upon entering.
It would save even expenses," he says.
In the interest of safety is the reason why Asiana lacks stewardesses in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We have no stewardesses, we are against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago to Týden.cz.
There was a huge tragedy.
In the accident of the line linking Naples, a young stewardess of Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus. without using the intermittents.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, he crashed with the right front.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the hostess's rest were sold.
"These sites cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the girl's family compensation but waits for the financial expenses also for the guilty party.
Law reform?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring greater precision to the movement of the stewardess on the bus in which thirty experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working for the past year.
"However, they have not come to any concrete conclusions.
They do not devote too much to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the motorway and the use of the mobile during the march," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewardesses to be a major threat to the safety of passengers," concludes spokesman Hanzelka, "that the control of safety in buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf's hope rests in Frankfurt
In the letter from the West LB Bank's board of directors to its collaborators, there is no shortage of words.
By merging the units of the Dusseldorf bank with the DEKA bank, it is possible to form 'a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group', as the writing says, published on Monday.
West Bank LB, breaking the `competition block' with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a start for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
This is how the text is understood, when a board wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because just like before the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the part of the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services, which recently made clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also from Frankfurt, there has been much talk about such a union between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse's customers know for their investment funds, and the West LB.
To tell the truth, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after a half year at the end of August let him know that he sees no meaning in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the board of directors of DEKA, which is now composed of the regional banks and the Sparkassen associations, instructed the board to start negotiations with the West LB on common commercial activities.
In this it could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, as is said on the financial site.
This is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the Sparkassen field, the name of the DEKA bank appears, which with its 3000 employees is one of the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and the Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed itself against Helaba's involvement in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But he was always playing again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba board of directors, said he was against the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Independently of that it seems clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
When the Bavarian Parliament elections are to pass, the BayernLB union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For the Helaba, that doesn't necessarily turn out to be good news.
If the pressure continues to merge will increase, Helaba will lack the partners to accomplish that.
In the south the bank could be only a young partner, although so far it stood out much better from the financial crisis that was done by the buildings of Stuttgart and Munich.
On the other hand the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided plans for coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB is left.
But such geostrategic reflections form only a part.
On the other hand, it concerns the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband deutsche so far gave no answer.
In the end the West LB can be broken down, but that, of course, is not the bank's own wish.
Thus, also in the letter of the board of directors of the bank it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the whole bank
Since the coexistence between singular parts of the bank and DEKA can be reconciled, that will show the time.
Oktoberfest's second weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena assists him as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-litre keg of Kaiser brand beer is a huge bear tiger that shows nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants that low sounds can produce in their throats.
First Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 three buses leave, `direction Munich, the beer party', expected arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to his flag are singing the South Americans, they had already started to party at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver patillas, belongs to these buses.
For five years they have been coming to Oktoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day on the meadow, at 22.30 the turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the law of the purity of Bavaria, health insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction "Brenner"
No beer, not yet.
Soon the tranquillity reigns on the bus, travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian license plate take another break on the highway 8 just before Munich.
Finally, when Marco's group has the expected arrival at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow hat.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to it in Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the tent doors open for the campaign, that means march!" Marco shouts in the morning.
"March!" Walk and occupy the back places in the tent of the campaign.
"Don't take the front places, because we're going to block, and all with yellow hats don't sit on the same bench, spread all over the place!"
One liter of beer, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
He's just getting out of his place, he'll be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon exactly at ten and a half you have to get here!" Do you understand?
And now everyone's going to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties the yellow hats in the trees, signs of traffic and even in a sign of the elections of a great Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It's Oktoberfest's second weekend that's known as "Italian weekend"
There are no exact data on the number of people; they are 50,000 people who travel over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police are assisted by seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross that makes a statistics of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistances, in front of the English (about 60 assistances) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favourite tent of the Italian campaign is thus called Hofbräuzelt.
Nights without sleep for the creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück stressed only last week.
Well, let the politician use the word "relatively" and add that the German banking environment will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the real estate financier of Munich, which is listed in the DAX index, receives from a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to be able to resist turbulence in the market.
On Monday a person who knows the situation very well said to Reuters: the credit aid amounted to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to cast interest.
Money comes from private banks, as well as from public-law banks.
The cause of this is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects financed them only for a short period - which now, due to mistrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the capital reserve of the cash bank has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of own capital has delayed a little from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, the continued revenues from financial investments and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero, the imputation revenues for debtors and some securities also those from the dissolution of provisions of credit businesses tended to fall by more than 70 percent, by EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the high and high revenues of the reimbursements of the costs of compensation of the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the federal tax code and the business organized for the companies of the consortium, the negative balance could charge a deficit with approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state financier was initially lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as a reason for the founding of Aareal Bank.
As much money could not be made with the financing of state projects, the Defa began to devote intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and was diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make depreciations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the group's consolidated profit and loss account, it is said very imprecisely.
It's a fact that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, they were cancelled at two-thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa the Hypo Real Estate became an important state financial and financial in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own customer deposits, it appears, compared to other banks, to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which took place two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a portion of the Defa's credit portfolios of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank credited the need for group financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of the international money markets that are now essentially unfit to operate"
Other sources say that thanks to this money refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, president of the board of directors of the Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) are based on the assumption that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That's what the shareholders and creditors of the bank have to wait for.
But because of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It is even conceivable that funding will not be needed in its full volume.
But the opposite case cannot be ruled out.
There was a rumor that on the last Sunday hour the bank was still almost in insolvency, so temporary salvation cannot reassure at least concerned people.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Borrowing courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts almost do not change, borrowing rates according to the position in the property registry clearly tend to fall.
These are mainly loans from the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, for the most part, loans whose maturity exceeds 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the present value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculations must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are unaffected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime it can start from amortization of pensions within the time frame.
Or something's going to happen, which you don't risk imagining anyone - the financial crisis is going to get over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross news about partial statization, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That's going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights without sleeping, breaking their heads on the decision about their isolation from enthusiasm.
Short-term investors can still put the end and use the new-account transport of losses for future benefits tax payments on change in the future.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent?-Box
When the first day Silvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls started laughing: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
I was scared before I went to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and go by train 40 minutes to Tachibana Highschool.
I just had to find the way, lucky I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not fixed as rigorously as at my home in Lower Saxony.
From eight o'clock in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
Besides, I am not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in the face of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt from the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I put on the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this time I was very happy because for two years now I had begun to study this language.
All 31 girls in class have whispered, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I knew her from my Mangas.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "mona, pretty"
Then I slipped quickly in my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong rang, I felt really assaulted.
Everyone spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions – at the same time it is very difficult to understand English from Japanese.
Then in the playground, everyone took out their Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a lunchbox for me - it's something other than boring pieces of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something like tofu mass meat.
In most cases I have no idea what to eat here in Japan.
Things are weird and have a new flavor.
What's certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of marinated plums in salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools bentos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in hopes of getting to know him better during a recess.
That's what I read about in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because I'm fascinated."
Finally for years I prefer to read Mangas.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying some Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I'm going to travel there.
Also because I have a weakness for tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
Since everything is well organized, I have not yet felt lost here although Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen in my life."
Rats have feelings, too.
It is said that a rat or cockroach feeling the danger flees, why is he also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, a neurologist, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can it be controlled if they, acting in a way similar to us, feel the same way?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years the contributions of famous scientists have been published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or someone else being able to prove it so far, although we can't even prove that other people are conscious.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about the feeling and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown field because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as other animals: it makes the dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to contaminate our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include circuits associated with the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their participation in short memory and in the executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than that of the other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from other primates.
Another particularity is found in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is linked to the language, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even though consciousness would not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as it pleases, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not allowed to be measured because it has special hardware, nor is it allowed to be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions relate to the content of the consenting experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal consciousness processes could be investigated without considering their contents, and this is what happens during the short-memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, the essential thing happens more to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Interestingly this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what results from that for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
From this point of view the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and above all man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, classifications of fine sensations follow because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar so that we can describe the states of others together with ourselves.
For example Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations derive from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for body feelings and the brain stem, the same Jaak Pankseep thinks, but focuses more on the brain stem.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can one control whether rats and men behave in a similar way feel the same?
Seeing the danger a cockroach runs away, because he's afraid?
I am of the opinion that the resemblance of behavior still does not prove the resemblance of experience.
That is true that the neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brainstems, cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how he can prove it.
I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations supposedly differ fundamentally from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress is expected here in the field of neurology while the same is measured for rats and men.
As I do not investigate the tongue and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know if they exist.
It may be said that I do not see beyond my nose, but I prefer to move forward than to work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA Platini President: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the Deputy Prime Minister said the preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government looks at the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as the test of confidence in Ukraine's ability to organise the European championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and in both countries there is a lot to do."
The schedule for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do work with great speed," said the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is not going to take our eyes off us."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslav Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European championship will not suffer from that."
In the last season alone many clubs in the first division were condemned for handling down to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid's indignant counterattack
She wanted to promote a new film, she was talking in an interview about private life- and she has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The late war of the two roses in Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid's ex-partner: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of marriage failure is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his appointment as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard that Meg how many times tells the story of our relationship in another version," the 54-year-old man told "New York Daily News."
Among other things it is very "sorry" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will again "remember in public the pain and changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is remarried and recently is a twin pope.
And so he ends his statements by emphasizing: "Be whatever my life may be, it continues.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that's fine."
Prices for air and hotel tickets are falling
In the first half of 2008 plane tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year's.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany became cheap even up to 50 percent.
Airfare and hotel overnight stays were again made cheap - this is the result of a study by the travel service provider and the financial services of American Express.
The company has analyzed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found a big change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe rose on average to 6.9 percent.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for this was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause of "the interests of American tourists in travelling diminished."
The decline in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and thus set a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, air ticket prices also showed rising trends:
Because of the increase in kerosene prices, Economy class travellers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long distance flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June the prices of airline tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany, price change was more notable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9 per cent in the second half of the year, falling to 23.6 per cent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of price change is on the one hand the increase in the weak economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the airline travel market demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft traffic between the US and Europe.
The signal of the tense situation is the cancellation of flights of non-profit distances in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankrupt - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
The HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him still does not go out to make the first goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the forced landing of the national player Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed to score a goal.
Everything he meant exactly by reacting to what had happened, he could read it clearly from his lips.
I just knew you were right.
"We need a second goal", whistled Hermann Rieger at the cabin entrance of the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time ended and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was almost for three decades a physiotherapist of the HSV, enjoying very great reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded with his head and lifted his fingers in a sign of assent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the principal coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that wasn't done.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," added Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with its head impact; and also the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
This Monday the SV of Hamburg will turn 121.
The Saturday will be the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stadium and the table change on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," said Marcell Jansen.
It predicts that the partial ratings in the table correspond more to the speed of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The quipo with its players forced late like the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the scorer Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the quipo cannot shine with their successes.
"We need more feeling and dribble," says Jol.
After the vote defeat
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the bank's bailout package dropped the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the biggest loss of points for a day in your history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
About 20:30 one of the most important stock exchange barometers in the world contributed a deficit of 5 percent in 10,579 units.
Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained at 1548 points.
At this time the biggest loser at the Dow Jones were American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could gain in value.
The shares of Goldmann Sachs Bank lost almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a large investor Warren Buffet had participated financially in the company.
The plan of salvation provides for the provision of resources to purchase so called "potrid" mortgage shares.
But the sum is going to be paid at once if not step by step.
As compensation for this, the state has to receive the share option receipts for financial associations that during the course development can be collected to reduce the financial burden of the state's cash.
Action courses in Europe and the US continue to fall
The billion-dollar aid for banks in Europe and the US does not reassure investors.
The course of the shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate decreases and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the salvation of the financial market projected by the state, the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculative shares of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the bailout shares of the federal government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier's action for a period of time lost two thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6000 points and contributed a deficit of 3.7 percent to 5,839 units.
All over the world, the financial markets suffered a fall.
The opening of the Wall Street Day in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the $700 billion bailout package from the U.S. government will not be enough to boost the financial markets.
In the first hour after opening the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The United States House of Representatives wanted to vote on the draft salvation, the Senate vote may be October 1st.

Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused the researchers to be disconcerted: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity cannot be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now he is threatened with cold death.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver, causes confusion among the researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes while they get an acceleration using the energy of a planet's gravitational field, for example from Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Sun Probe Ulysses.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave by 100 percent as expected according to the venerable law of gravitation.
Rather, they frequent speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes have a higher or lower speed.
The physicists could not explain this effect until now.
He was called the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space, cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, believes solemnly now as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what remained astronomers in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly can be the Dark Matter that can also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe have only known the existence of Dark Matter for ten years.
It supposedly possesses the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible, which means that it does not send and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the attention of the kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper tells about the most important cases.
Apparently European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are released.
About that the same information presents the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After news of the release on the Italian radio station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian Foreign Minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
"We now control your state of health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are fine and are in security, reports Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to the rescue," the guard said.
It was just "receive the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers had killed six kidnappers and two of them had been arrested in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany the ransom in the amount of six million euros; the money had to deliver the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take the position on this report.
Misuse of stepfather "has led to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stitians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an investigative study, knew that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court heard that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and blindfold her before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working at a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court was aware that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had been subjected to twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some of Mrs. Rande's friends had said about her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead," as if she had "renunciated her life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that concludes by saying: "I used to tie her up and break her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends with the victim taking away his own life.
Even more clearly, it is that if she had not done so, the issue would probably not have ended in the courts."
He added: "I have noticed the effect that, according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother, the abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip through the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is probably the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of intent to commit a crime.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Judicial Service noted that the staff member must be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Service Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then moved from his home to a secret location.
Construction companies face B&B's price
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of over £80,000 after the rescue/salvation of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The Government provided £14 trillion to protect the deposits of the bank's 2.6 million savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies using the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humiliating" that companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the 14-billion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
In the meantime, however, interest is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies with deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved with prudence ... are called to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and mediation companies had to pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be £450,000 in 2009.
This implies that companies will have to recover £81,000 to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent."
According to the BSA, there are no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to look at all aspects of this issue in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a relevant price," Cole added.
Interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest payable, which could be almost twice as high.
As mutual construction companies are organizations and there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher fees or lower interest on their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence per litre
The people on the Jersey stand will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence per litre from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and following the investigations carried out by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had risen before February, was in 2002.
Denied bail to former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the bail application for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
Its defenders said that the court did not grant him bail on charges of extortion of Taka 50 million ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several allegations of corruption against him.
His long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's government, supported militarily, first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while he was given probation to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of his release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail application for Sheikh Hasina claiming that he could not obtain bail because he was already in treatment abroad on probation," his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We're going to file an appeal against the Supreme Court order."
Its advocates argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after October 17, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provisional government, backed by the army, assumed power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges against them.
Fears for the anti-poliomyelitis campaign in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan – says the UN – have not been able to take advantage of a recent polio vaccination campaign due to Taliban violence.
Last week the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or obstructed thousands of officials while carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision that forced the company to reduce its participation in rival ITV broadcasting.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Court of Appeal that it will have to reduce its participation of 17.9% in ITV below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission stated that BSkyB's interests impeded competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV ownership raised doubts about the independence of ITV, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin's boss, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the obligation to reduce its package on ITV was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, BSkyB said, it would have delivered its voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the performance of administrative officials.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators and former Produrador General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from office by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been dismissed for low performance.
But later it was learned that lawyers had not been assessed worse than other colleagues, and many observers concluded that dismissals would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
and can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successive head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the dismissals, resigned his position.
A number of other Department of Justice officials did the same.
The Attorney General's report is very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the matter, and underlines how he had a "primary responsibility" for dismissals, which "abdicated" from his leadership position and was "notably non-collaborative" in the process.
Other officials, including Bush's former collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf of much honor
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive the special prize next week at the ceremony in London, said that getting this recognition will be "an honor".
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group are running the nominations for this year's awards and making the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity such as that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the classification.
However, Bat Out Of Hell by Meat Loaf remained about nine years in the rankings and came to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for his heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it appeared that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply of service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-time local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of First Street – before I found the Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little alley, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley more than one active lane.
There's no sign.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on First Street
who wants to repave Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the old-fashioned neighbors who commented they were delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remains of the past of the block before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At this month's meeting of the Community Committee on Land-Use Ventilation, representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, asked for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the District Manager of the Community n.3 said.
"The city today owns very few spaces and we would like you to continue to own Extra Place," said Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, while waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street came up for the first time during this month's meeting
but Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it did not necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was the city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is to develop ownership rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, was opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps better known for the photograph of the establishment that comes out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the urbanization of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, practically unchanged, a slice of the city that should be guarded.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk of the city's history about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and dead end, dark also for the day and marked by rusty iron storage doors and counter-windows, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the ravines."
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and the door that was used to enter the CBGB, which now houses a luxury clothing store, stood close by.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22-oz were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested that they could be cleaned up.
Mr Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its present state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet, and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Obama's campaign notes that "African-Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very certain consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for students-English.
However, the open question for Mr Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers instruction in languages other than English in the classroom, is effective in nullifying the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income families:
more than a third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, are learning English.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students, has been positively evaluated in the math exam of 2008
and almost an equally amazing 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved by using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama favored.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies and does not tolerate any excuses.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the main of Sixth Street, the school's approach to English instruction to students is in the "total immersion."
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like this one who has arrived from Mexico and that if you enter the classroom 12 months later you would not be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating by other schools with large populations of Spanish-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of his party's politicians on the issue of education (the Associations for National Education have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their very constant support for bilingual education obscures the prediction of Mr Obama's response.
While immigrants must learn English, Mr. Obama has recently trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about the legislation that is only written in English
And instead, he said, "you must make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close loopholes, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than scorn them or trivialize them.
Oil prices fall sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil fell drastically this Monday because of the concern that the American bailout plan for the financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
Crude oil stocks decreased by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning negotiation at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel earlier this month, before going back, once again, because of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety seized investors, once again, on Monday, despite Congressional leaders who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, according to what the government said this Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts in Barclays Capital said that, on the frantic weekend, the negotiations that led to the rescue agreement "seem not to have been able to reactivate the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The prospects for global equity, the interest rate and exchange rate will become increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the coming year, such as low oil consumption due to the economic growth crisis and the forecast for lower oil and gas prices is 20 per cent for 2009.
Second quarter insanity: team sets record
After spending, over the past eight seasons, more time than anyone in Jets' uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought I'd seen it all.
Then he saw how things developed in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without annotation into a game of deflating.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had lazily played under the shadows of the clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles doing a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of relationship between the players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the room, one of which when one cornerback fell and the other one came in with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that were going to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were working at the dam, the Cardinals' defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to fail by Warner.
In the last turn, Bowens' faults could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked him 20 yards to win a final 34-0.
These are the major points the Jets never made in a room.
To Team Coach Eric Mangini, ask him to describe the madness of this moment, he said: "The second quarter or the third quarter? "
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say I liked the second quarter much more than the third.
They've earned a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Rested Gebrselassie Leads World Record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated why many consider him the greatest runner in history, surpassing his own world record at the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running the race of 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the comfortable flat race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has broken for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in a race of impressive length so it has set a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the race against the clock to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would exacerbate his problems with asthma.
Instead, he aimed to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing on average a few cutters 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told journalists that he had suffered cramps on the calf two weeks earlier and had lost a week of training.
Clearly, the suspension left him fresh, unoxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie said to the journalists.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything was fine."
The athlete has been the object of some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Afro-East rival - for the style of orchestrating his careers too much, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting the record ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's abilities as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half of the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after his pacemakers declined.
But just before three miles from the finish line, Gebrselassie took a last push to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi reached third place at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also didn't take part in the Beijing Games so she was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her best record staff in almost five minutes on the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculus race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to head and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and proofs of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated in the country and childhood place of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not a prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, Harlem's most famous Renaissance writer.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage through its inclusion in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression Season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, that "she knows so little about us and that she doesn't know what's going on."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told," said 59-year-old Jones Hortense, a lifetime resident and member of the oldest church in the city.
"You have to be right."
Eatonville has always been a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a poverty level double the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the Black South - sometimes scorned, others praised - that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who live here are both proud and reserved.
A And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialectic books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "There Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida often forgotten inside the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a cement face in both life and literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road to the left," he wrote, "there's the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions the widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes away with transient rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs Hurston brings Eatonville into contact with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Evidently, this Fodor didn't do it.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colorless songs about their beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without notice in a big Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still today prides itself on wearing dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcasticly.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," follows Mr. Franklin.
But, he adds, swinging in his chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary from Langston Hughes and the only colored woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, no major public readings.
"I don't think your contribution to the world or your legacy was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to set up a five-lane road across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main street in the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to it relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the ‘50s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred to the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys were going around the city throwing oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next door," Mr. Franklin said.
"They killed a girl, too, once.
He was thrown at a watermelon in the car."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court, which in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted rather than honoring my race."
A Residents today say that the disintegration of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural gap there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who went over prejudices, as she did, with buoyant, confident and lines like: "How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous grave and began to fight to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookstores, reintegrating her into American canons.
The road project arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was again under the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin on that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the five-way road would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
Out-of-town people like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church from here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (taking the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a revamped and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a street in the past in a summer rain, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come looking for Eatonville's story, its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A An advance permit is necessary to do most interviews, and some things - like murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs Jones, a courageous and convinced teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fears that her island community might be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, silly and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's 18-year-old nephew, Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, in case they dare go this far, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other'," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at his story, it's a very nice city."
This way, in New York, everybody talks about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from kiosks and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the bee nesting offices above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York face daily the worst "bad day of the office" since the low of 1929.
Boys for home delivery continue to resonate their metal tea carts through the sidewalks and carry trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to drag between buildings of charged apartments, as well as human mules, with 50 shirts of eccentric print hanging to a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their food to take in the morning, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
The employees still wait by queue for their bagel to the carts of the sellers, and yet it is impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on the days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there are, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw his cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where customers of all life order their checkbooks, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy's large warehouses and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "trusted personal banker," and they were in line for the same reason as I was.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places where they had switched them, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Island of Staten.
They had taken their money from the so-called savings associations (a little like a construction company), from the credit unions and from the savings banks of their home city whose whites only function within the state of belonging, and who claim to treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed for their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers of the offices and shops standing in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become experts in finance in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its distressed-looking executive director, Dick Fuld, commenting on the matter with familiarity as if they complained about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, 50th and something uniformed from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping at the storekeeper.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings on money market funds.
Switching is done, I'm not taking any risks."
Desecrated Muslim Tombs as Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the extreme right-wing party for freedom in Austria and Belgian Filip Dewinter, affiliated with the extreme right-wing party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signals representing mosques with a red line crossing.
The police are blaming extreme right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend as the extreme right-wing political parties made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Traun cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in which the police believe it was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the tombs, but researchers think this may have happened by trying to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached the Muslim religious when the month of Ramadan was running out.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that took almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Austrian Future Alliance, had conducted a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of its slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the Freedom Party leader who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against the headscarves and burkas, and also expressed opposition to the foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties intend to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the current policy of Islamization in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of sexual abuse of children, from travelling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a ban on travelling abroad last Thursday after magistrates had produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by counsel Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, the police requested a disposition to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's foreign travel as it did to France and Spain until March 25th.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, by virtue of being registered as a sex offender.
He has to inform the authorities in case he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary for him to communicate to the police the scheduled date seven days in advance of his departure.
Kent police said they wouldn't discuss Glitter's individual case or possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the main concern of Kent police and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risk to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted on returning to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates' Court west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I capture the teacher off stage to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no flyers, no opening suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration on interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of the man or the woman.
Aside from the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in privacy, in those moments outside the public, when to find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a few hands, carefree because they are not going to come to the scene.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different fields.
Included in the programme of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people but, when seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists you don't have to take photos from the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With the taste of the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1.997 to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classical basis of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of dancing, singing or touching itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essentials, with the elf that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotomata.
Known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to enter a moment in their life, be it a long or short moment.
I think inside the photograph the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, who you sometimes don't even know, or who leave you only a few minutes to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco that bears the title "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the Gallery El Fotomata, located in the number 20 of the street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where you can visit until the next 16th of October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel she writes is "a temerity"
It is set in places that it does not yet know and deals with unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to carrying out the new project in which he works, a novel that has as its protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite for the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him "is a temerity" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If it were wise, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days he has seen pass through the city of Aqueduct to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the prominent figures of the third edition of the feast of the word and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend", filled the space of the Juan Bravo Theatre.
Presented by Felix Romeo, he found before him an audience handed over to whom the hour was very short when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "live more than he lived"; how he writes of "disciplined manner" to supply his "lack of inspiration" with an intense documentation work, correcting and reworking much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more unconform", so he asked the writers "not to abandon themselves to frivolity" and "take responsibility" for their vocation.
The climatology diminishes the fair of Pozoblanco that also runs out of rejoins
The rejoining party that closed the credit of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the announced rejoiners that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather has been abiding with this fair, as two of its three festivities have finally not been able to be held.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bullfight planned.
The cartel was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a prison in Castilblanco.
So, only Friday was a celebration.
In it, the triumphant was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and went out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante released his two assads with greetings and an ear, which granted more tendons than his toreo.
Even worse was El Juli, who passed through the cosus of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his second bull, after a work of relief he won the grudge of a large part of the public.
They skip a control in Alava in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Arminón (Álava).
The officers call off the two occupants of a van and they start the flight.
Its load, more than two tons of hashish, was not like stopping.
The officers chased them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A.A.J., according to a statement from the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several staff members of the Álava Traffic Unit carried out a transport check at the N-1, as they passed through the municipality of Arminón.
They were going to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, accelerated abruptly and jumped control.
The officers began their persecution until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometres later on the shore, when their two occupants came down to flee the race through a forested area.
The ertzains finally reached out to one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish bales, and they were then transferred to police units for thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration had been "folded" as it did not coincide with the collection in the van documentation, and the arrested person was also charged with a criminal offence of falsification of a public document.
The Ertzaintza continues the investigation to proceed to the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as said, and determine the origin of the drug seized.
The detainee, A.A.J., 28 years old, was transferred to police units to carry out the relevant investigations and will be brought to justice in the next few hours.
Arrested actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effects of some medicine
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medicine.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her car park in Montecito, according to a spokesman for California's highway patrol, People magazine.
The witness has detailed that about 4.30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping deep into the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot forward and backward, and as he went back he passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby highway and leaving the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "as the officers observed at first glance, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medicine."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under some unspecified substance and entered the local prison around 7 p.m. although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left a treatment clinic in Arizona where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of UI to assume its competences in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and deputy of Izquierda Unita, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of training that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councillor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of performing favor treatment to family members.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," said Llamazares on the performance that the party will have to adopt with which until now councillor in the Seville consistory.
However, the UI leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in the possible investigations into irregularities that Silva might have committed: "UI has always advocated that such matters have the highest degree of transparency."
In the same vein, he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'May Blood', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in May Blood, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide cast of interpreters.
Blood of May, with a film more than two and a half hours, is premiered this Friday in the cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours duration.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this film "a dream of childhood", which must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2, Madrid, something that he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set up with the decorated and the appropriate clothing the portrait of "an atolondrada Spain that was wrong to fight for, since, the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having counted on a funding like that of Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice as much as that of Blood of May-, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes framed in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
For this reason, the director of Back to Start, has influenced in which is his usual form of work, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the shooting and to whom he does not cast, because it seems "humiliating" and consider that "part of the director's job lies in going to the theater and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters who match in May's Blood repeat before his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate for the Oscar on four occasions - of which he won one-, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Blood of May itself, Seven French Billiard Tables and the finally selected, The Blind Sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one to be made known", he said.
With this movie Garci does not expect prizes.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you settle for making one more movie," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Seville dancer Tortola Valencia
A Seville dancer is going to pay tribute to a Seville dancer too.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented free women's movement.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I thought it was amazing."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to count his life but to gather his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
Her dance was sexy and I was told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," she says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one of his shows, as he did in the one of "The Open Door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever his student was.
"Matilde makes Tortola the oldest, the character of maturity.
I am happy that I have accepted to act in my work and I am very honored by it."
The assembly also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the violin of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas in all its extension, and who are always in love with them".
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in places as far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, as she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she is one of those women who have a huge influence at a given time and now no one knows and much less values her work," says Bayón.
The show will start today at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the "Diary of a newlywed poet" also closes the Trienium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Council of Culture of the Junta de Andalucia to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized in order to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That cup of light", which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the various Andalusian provinces, is planned to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
Also, the Council of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absence of Malitia", and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of all America, given the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look how hard it cost them to give him an Oscar.
And that he was retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be very sick.
It's still been a boulder for everyone.
"Sometimes what you feel is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend," Robert Redford cried, "my life and my country were better because of their existence."
No one was afraid of making a fool of themselves or exaggerating.
A father of the cinema and the homeland had died at a particularly dark moment, afraid of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the floor, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings to admire remain you, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his firstborn who died of overdose to his home and organic food brand.
A whole gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration barred Hollywood without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that a man had not died but an era.
Another Englishman, the oscarized director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was nothing more or less than the height of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"It has left us all very high," noted George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping high the demand for probity and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once, but then he was married to Joanne Woodward, who he was faithful to when he was probably left with the opportunities not to be.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger outside the house, if I have steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as the devoted husband, loving father, solicitous grandfather and dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect career of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is to have an Olympics in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race was called, and in my opinion it was the worst race I've ever been in.
A bunch of misconceptions that, of course, if they took it into account as an assessment and I looked into it, would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go through it and from the beginning.
The misconceptions begin with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go before.
Which doesn't sound bad to me, but if they already make you go, give it everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the dorsal (first purpose, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the T-shirt (second purpose, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Or is it that because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small t-shirts with less fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a minute compared to the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the queue upon arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes waited, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as was to be expected, the race began and we had not left the backpack yet, although once it was achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain eased the wait of more than 40 minutes, which gathered with connates of popular rebellion and assault on the cottage.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they won't even show up with the right time in the ranking, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, didn't mark my exit correctly.
Of course, if they asked me about the perfect race, it wouldn't fit into my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual)
At the Emerging Technologies conference at MIT Microsoft has shown an advance in a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company's campus) taking care of what he hears in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that it is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he is there to visit someone and tells him that he will attend shortly.
All without a blue screen.
Awesome.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week, much more has been said about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of commercial basket loads, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
A whole find considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of direction is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and also the software.
When Google Chrome went online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for Hardware and Software to understand.
Do the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear but one must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts just to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half the applications that come into the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less heavy, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft's employee rest rooms in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
In the soda machine a sign asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not come to the beginning of 2009 but to the end, rather by throwing at 2010.
In Microsoft they will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, will pass the bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio was wearing Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', the same as Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather', Al Pacino and was part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we start enumerating stellar apparitions, we can go back to the image of that pointed mustache fork that lifted weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it's just the typical men's shirt made of cotton, strapped and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which they call the English speakers, but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles points to all the others.
First, by its rumbling name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with sport because it receives its name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out over the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic T-shirt models carry as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its tank tops.
Also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, navy t-shirts, babes, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for underwear comfort.
Though it's a shame to leave them as underwear.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Today the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they're a lot more than some pretty, famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that Mango makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, wins in short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, as well as attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense but, at the same time, exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the movies of the '50s and '60s; from there we get a lot of references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch women go dressed, as they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have a lot of ties in common.
I used to like clothes when I was a little girl; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to sneak into my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of my dress.
You know that dancers really like to do our styling for classes and rehearsals, to look us in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the costume is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, that's right, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You haven't done 30 long, have you had a crisis?
What's up?
I feel better than ever, I like the 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a little girl and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body asks for it and, besides, I want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss it.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you're looking forward to several premieres you shot last year.
That's right, and I already want you to see the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless, everything I want for now and of course, cannot be.
I want 'The Last Hour' and 'Looking for the Tomb of Christ' to be released.
Seeing how they look to you...
A few days ago you debuted on a catwalk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I got on a catwalk to model.
He simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to London to participate in a charity parade for his organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we wear - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - was auctioned to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that, as I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I keep that part so good that she gets involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he ever asks me to make a pine tree, so too.
For the benefit of women in the third world, whatever it takes.
Alcoholic recidivist drivers should install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholemia, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the drunk vehicle from starting, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the Attorney General's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is the reinsertion of the driver, so the driver will also receive a course of road re-education.
In the experience, in addition to the Attorney General of Segurida Vial, will participate the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Instituto Tecnológico para la Seguridad del Automobil (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for driving drunk again take the car.
The alcoholic would avoid it because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in breathed air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow abs; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected it is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would run on behalf of the sanctioned.
In this sense, a study carried out in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain, it is estimated that it could save 115 people every year.
The measure is subject to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address such behaviour before it results in criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done on an ordinary basis, and yet the necessary reform through criminal means requires reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been piloted in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative of the PSOE in which it intends to install on the school buses this system, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 1740, the time scheduled for the programme, the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to see the real couple descend from the plane.
On foot, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or so...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the journey.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar stuck to the red carpet and a military fence formed by 27 marines who interpret the salvo of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, melena to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual peep-toes, perhaps they had told him that in the DF threatened storm.
They give a smile and a short stop to the photographers before passing to the room where the official committee awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four greats of the city, a reporter from Mexico TV is waiting for them.
The best gifted prize of fashion
There may not be a place in the world more suitable to present a fashion award, than Paris and possibly there is no more exquisite and bont living designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in Mango's window at 54 Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and almost wept from emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the event, caused us to finish at a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with his heart broken with sorrow and making with guts of heart, for the recent death of his brother, put on a suit of the House and some dressings of ELAH, which cut off the breath, and his son Luis' arm - a cannon of almost two meters in length - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, next to the baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner turned into a long black sexy dress, was excited when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a amago of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre didn't stay for the walk through the palace's outbuildings, but before he taught us on his son's mobile phone photos.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canyon that travels by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having asked previously, that there would be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There is not 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frantic everyday life.
And just in case, everyone is gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine itself wrapped in the agitated rhythm that imposes today's life.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection from the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, the classic massage or the 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each one.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the libraries at the hand of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If one considers that it is not possible to achieve peace of mind in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore balance of body and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect the mind and focus on reading.
Talking Sleepy
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but children who talk while asleep.
The first time it happens, maybe you get scared, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a benign sleep disorder called sleepyos.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one has been told he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (sleep pee) or sleepwalking, but it doesn't have to be so.
As mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcited situations.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
He may speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or otherwise (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense the child should be observed and consulted with a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him/her a way out.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, therefore it has no treatment, except that it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress disorder).
What can be done is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are scary or a little violent.
With very nervous children who have a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some internal calm.
This will help the child to have a quieter dream.
Once the sleepyos appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what has happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even if he's talking, he's sleeping and is therefore resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes you should consult or find out what is causing so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common thing), do not fall into the temptation to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because being asleep isn't conscious enough to organize his thinking.
Besides, you will hear what he says, but you don't know what he's dreaming to say that, so be very careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can question him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory in his field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having made a good match, the team created many chances of goal and was able to make a goal to win the match.
The rhythm was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to rub the squad with a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the "power" and by turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of his foot or also Diebold came to prevent the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we did not let the midfielder pass and left only Riahi in attack position.
The beginning of the second half was crucial, first with two chances of goal of Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, well located to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt of Diebold (53 ').
But the Illhousiens scorer will not be able to taste his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven Illhousians who retreated a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after an important butterfly, the ball passed very close to the cross field.
Sarkozy finds the fishermen furious
Before taking off for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a roundabout for Britain.
In the face of the demonstration of resistance from the fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to find there its representatives.
They promised to welcome him " in a constructive spirit " and hope that " he will come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " set up by the Breton fishermen to take action against rising oil prices, which marks a record at EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Eliseo's spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses become competitive again and to save the sailors' terms of employment and pay. "
Fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy on foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce circulation in Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The sports port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
" A filter barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors already showed on Monday their determination by burning, by scratching the dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlántico region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Total Donges refinery.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until this Wednesday's meeting that will take place at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not abandon " and " do not want to move to Paris, " announced Liliane Cariou, for example, the chairman of the Lorient fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay fees on diesel fuel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached only with a diesel fuel at a price of less than 0.30 euro per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two Men and One Destiny " has died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautical company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that weigh in the world economy.
The fourth world aeronautical manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed Embraer's president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG intends to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurer, who has been taken out of trouble thanks to the American monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets with the aim of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, says this newspaper.
AIG's board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to review any sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to separate include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 % stake in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer, as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times pursues.
AIG must quickly conduct liquidity to repay its 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting it with the appropriate proportion among the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 %, a loss never seen on the Stock Exchange of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14 %.
The industrial index Dow Jones fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most significant fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, the day on which exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, which is technologically dominant, declined 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the index widened (extended) Standard & Poor's 500 by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the final figures of the closure.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed a little stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, representatives denied the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the media he was asking for.
Nearly two Republicans out of three rejected their plan.
" That's not a good sign sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan, " estimated Lindsey Piegza of the FTN Financial.
" This shows the extent to which the market had this plan," Lindsey Piegza added, fearing that a project adopted within several days would arrive "too late."
" If the project is really dying... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the American central bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions, " warned Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
And further emphasizing the sense of urgency, " every passing day the fall of a financial institution is announced " in the United States, stressed Ms. Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis dramatically accelerated, causing emergency interventions to benefit banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, showing that markets are facing "not only a crisis in the US but a global crisis, " added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen dramatically.
The yield of the 10-year treasury bond fell by 3.632 %, compared to 3.827 % on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond by 4.161 %, compared to 4.357 % on the day before.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
At the first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House, another one happened to know who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's, though honorable, performance was not "bright enough" to allow him to stop his quit in the polls five weeks after the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday gives Obama five points of advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), believes that it is the Democrat who did well.
Among the indecisive voters, who are the ones who count, Obama won with 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them give the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
" It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts, " warns Bill Clinton, however, this weekend.
The Septuagint McCain highlighted his undisputed experience in foreign policy, underlining the "ingenuity" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first challenge.
" Senator Obama does not seem to understand that... " he accused several times.
" I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president, " he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television ads.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without disconcerting himself, he was concise and precise.
He enhanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so, " he said this weekend a Democratic television advertisement that reproached the Republican for not having considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on the Americans. "
" During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a tight rain.
He did not pronounce the words "medium class" or "workers." "Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most capable character to save the economy that is on the edge of the precipice.
" Next week could be a decisive episode, " said influential Democrat Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama ' s " good economic instincts " with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster "is the end result of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain. "
Reaffirming that it would, in spite of everything, reduce taxes by 95 per cent of Americans in spite of the surges on Wall Street, the Illinois Senator also noted that the realization of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a health and safety system.
McCain wants to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Carefully, both candidates shirked the issues relating to the $700 billion financial bailout plan (€470 billion) adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Young people and opponents were demonstrating last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislatures.
Hundreds of Belarusians met on Sunday afternoon since the closure of the electoral centres in Minsk Central Square to protest against the fraudulent character of the legislature.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Lukashenko: " the dictator has to resign " .
Some recognize that they have not voted: "For what, since they will do what they want with my vote, " says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime that placed foreign observers in good hands in order to renew contact with the European Union is prepared to bring about a democratic change.
Sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered to be fair to observers.
They weren't according to the opposition.
" We have been placed alongside the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of votes, " lamented Iuri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
" It's a cosmetic change," says Alexandre Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our home, it's the executive power.
If some Members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
" But their entry into parliament can mean appearances on television, meetings in the regions, and bills. "
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, is in crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent. "
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the figures for participation seemed too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) favoured manipulation.
" Have you noticed the elections? Ask Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition to parliament, who are better suited to power."
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
Above all, he regained the public's confidence that had been seriously shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would not happen again.
While Judge Krever was late in presenting his relationship, some provinces then set up a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this mission.
As a result of reports by Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of the people still trusted the blood system in Quebec," Décary recalls.
The situation was disappointing.
After having made a lot of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work during the years that followed, we have regained public confidence," he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that "trust is an extremely fragile thing".
Since its creation on September 28, 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were witnessing the birth in Europe of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
We then rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know it and when a serious disease can emanate from it, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by a brain degeneration that inevitably leads to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of those who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But a few years ago, it has been shown beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense. "
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: tests of nucleid acid that allow the presence of the virus in the blood of donors and not the presence of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
Nucleid acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
We therefore substantially reduce the risk that certain donors will be infected without knowing it and that we will not be able to detect them.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of getting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one person every 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"That means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
So since Hema-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500,000 blood products each year, more than 24 years will pass before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product.
I think you can today receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover your health without worry," says the head of the management of Hema-Québec.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
"We must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary says before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
" Needs are increasing because the population is ageing.
As the most aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the blood donor network, which groups on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All healthy, 18-year-olds who meet the eligibility criteria can however donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travelled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But the members of this network of donors must be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since life today is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate his blood, " says Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered biomedical waste is filled with a blood rich in stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
" We celebrated a few weeks ago, the laying on the bench of our thousandth sample of blood from the umbilical cord and it is expected to take out more than a thousand of these a year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year, " says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood intake program as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this, " as Hema-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact on the semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinals of the elimination series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a victory by 3-1 (4-3 in short) at the cost of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series, at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a goal anywhere, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many chances of a goal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who broke up Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that during the first match in the round-trip series, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinal.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the game back to take him for 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless accessed in the semifinals for 5-4.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short – Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadian's number one trio is ready to start the season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec, and Andrei Kostitsyn's unit led the Canadian 3-2 win-win attack on the barrier-free shots in front of the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the quarter of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
" I'm not ready yet, I warn the Russian.
" I need another game to feel comfortable. "
He tried to play as much as possible in the first half, Guido Carbonneau noted.
But I think you appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation. "
Charest handles the North
Prime Minister does not exclude starting elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get elected during today's by-election.
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern border ": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force by staying on the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining operations, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great media as during the election period.
The Prime Minister thinks that the elections will take place this autumn, although he showed that his schedule was very full.
The "North Plan " is the fourth side of a "vision" the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space " which includes an agreement on labour with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was " a jewel to the immense potential " , but did not give an end, amounts of investment, or precise priority in future projects.
What could, above all, be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, doped up by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond " , as enumerated by Mr. Charest.
This " territory twice as big as France " is our home, it is in Quebec.
Not only is he at home, but he is in us, " he insisted, to show that he was requesting a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the golden riad in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, James Bay.
" It belongs to us, it is our future, " he added, after having made a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all governments reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I reiterate that position on the part of the government, " he said.
Moreover, "with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North, " he said, speaking of the northwest passage, which will open every year because of the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Member of the Ungava Quebec Party), have already begun consultations around thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting at which " a common vision will be given " .
Northern development would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan "will be agreed upon, ordered and environmentally friendly", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
" Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought otherwise to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival in power of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central at Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
" From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa who made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future, " said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963, referred to another reference, that conservative.
Turning to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
" This stays between us, but I plan to be there, " he confided to his militants, cheering.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows him.
He stressed that his schedule was however full, particularly because of a mission by the federation council in China and a Quebec-New York York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no difficulty in being accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec, in particular, called for recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and for them to have the right of veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcomed the broad lines of the Northern Plan with scepticism.
The leader of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, renounced its application.
If he had done so, "we would have made progress today" said Mrs Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote made today), Françoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
" But what is desired is that this is not just a show, " commented leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonored country
It's Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) in Harper's cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a shame for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who waged an unceasing battle for justice and who deserves all our admiration for what she says all about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are recriminated to him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and lets a child-soldier live in inhuman conditions.
He's the only one who has false justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to benefit from an equitable process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of extortion.
We still do not realize that, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when no more morals exist: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far a minority wants (what will happen after October 14th?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtue, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government renounced what did the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews, shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice President and Director of the Canadian Mining Company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world's largest gold company attempted a defamation process of six million euros against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of persecutions for defamation, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will gag the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to examine the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is before the public that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by cluttering.
It was sufficient for the mining company to open its books, files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and support letters for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can call for a "public " debate by disregarding his views?
According to the vice president, it seems that this word only designates highly paid lawyers and not for all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does it especially because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes in arguments, and not on what many people perceive as a persecution-breeding (persecuting " public debate " , Barrick Gold has just filed a requirement with respect to the authors of Noir Canada intimidating them to no longer use this word).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and truth, essential for all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the wealthy companies of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold truly wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he claims, he does not want to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices to limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and Congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
It envisages in particular: better control by the elected representatives of their implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized the lack of payment, as well as a right of control over the wages paid to the leaders of the aided companies.
The American Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day round of negotiations.
" We are making great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets, " said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
" Everything has been done to cover the economy and the ordinary Americans in the face of the current Wall Street crisis, " explained the Democrat.
" It's the fundamental point: if we don't do this, trauma, chaos, and disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense, " said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had been over very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect of a further failure on investors' mood.
The last hour that had been set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who had joined the negotiations late, were rather in favour of the agreement, without forgetting to express their discontent with being forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain arrangements to reach the agreement, particularly that which would allow the owners to keep their home and that on the salary of the leaders of the surviving companies by the state.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, no congratulations are due.
But these measures are necessary, " he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, interrogated in another channel to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: " I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it. "
" The important points I have read [show] that it is something we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said that the option of doing nothing is not acceptable. "
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money the doubtful debts, the risky and unsellable assets of the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the explosion of a real estate bubble that first led to the sinking of mortgage risk credits before it spreads to other more common forms of debt securities (PCAAs) and triggers a liquidity freeze and an outpouring of banks and financial institutions.
It's a group of Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have come out of the deadlock since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to smooth the roughness for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision stipulating that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, it could impose new fees that would try to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which 100 more billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote from Congress.
In exchange for your help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will be worth dividends in case of profits and that it will be able to resell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the option of delaying the embargo procedures for housing obtained from real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and cash compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see him put to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is still not sure that his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest this project yesterday, both from Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, member of the chamber finance committee, told his constituents that "with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand."
" We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the benefit of taxpayers. "
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is animating a small group in Congress, presents the problems in another way, but comes to the same conclusion.
" Four hundred economic teachers, including three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us to tell us: "We ask Congress not to rush and examine carefully the path to be taken, " said yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had given up buying its bankrupt competitor since it lost EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) during the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
" This is not lost money, " said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
Instead, we recovered a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is just something that savers and families now appreciate that times are uncertain. "
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and over €41 billion (75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is the one who would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
The American actor with a charming smile had freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensibility and a talent that was evident will also have removed him from the record of power that true sacred monsters have.
But what a great cross-country runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at 83, from lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the past few years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom he looked a lot and who was long regarded as a rival in cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes children magnificent.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, last brand of quality.
Because in it was projected a whole country in love with self-made man, the combatant of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, on television and soon in cinema.
This man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the show world that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death caused vertigo to the cinephiles this weekend, while his great roles are shattered on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual moving parades through it.
Many memories come back to mind as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on Tennessee Williams' adapted zinc roof in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoked his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have moved on to film history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable at Someone Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This cute manganese in the sumptuous film The Sting (El Golpe), Oscar to the best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which won him his only Oscar among nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him especially thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With one last role as the Irish mob's godfather on Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Contrary to several film legends that left the race pretty soon, Newman stayed a long way in the world of film, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its lashes and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier humorously considered him " as a challenge that lives in " underplaying " and that judges his performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of a young galan than of a marginal one: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose features reflected the rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed sides of his true not well-known pubic sensibility.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott due to overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
" Among the many tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former arms companion Robert Redford (they had worked together at The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) claimed, very saddened: " my life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his career as a legend, he also hides a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester against Hollywood's excesses.
We will have seen much of his face reign over the pots of vinegar sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although he started as a gag.
The profits of these sales were given to your Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than content himself with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there. "
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What were they producing at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on 8 October, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing frauds of significant harm, in a business-like manner, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Office of the Prosecutor, the funds obtained in public competitions were used for their own purposes, often justifying the performance of tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the municipalities - in total about 65 million HUF - stopped in part in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and in part in the pocket of private people.
The method, which was also made known by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the various associations never fulfilled their obligations assumed.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were fake.
For this purpose they obtained the heelwork in the market of the District of Józsefváros and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made was decided among others on that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent to Istvan Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption and these were used as a model to make the invoices they presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the City Council of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András, who, according to our information, wrote the necessary reports to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic centre provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the center manager - so many people do not fit at the same time in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, yet on the bill there were one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of the great fantasy invoice also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. because in the holding of books of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the manager of that company, informed hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and he was shown the invoices, he knew that they were false documents.
"On the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems he also did not agree that according to the bill, 100 people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people fit.
In addition, meals were also included on the bill, while the restaurant has not been working for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice makers were also not informed that the travel agency elected in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so that in the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated as a service a journey within Hungary, which did not coincide with the practice of issuing invoices from the agency.
Furthermore, as was known during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, despite the fact that travel outside the territory of the European Union was tax-free.
Among other things the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért foundation, since the services of that company are not loaded with a 25 but only 15 percent VAT, besides the hotel employees only extended invoices made by machine however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "shippers" made other mistakes as well, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as an activity carried out the road transport to which - it was learned during the investigations of the prosecution - does not carry out the company founded as investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false seal - it was known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue such invoices.
Nor did the counterfeiters pay attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation process, that is why the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - refused to issue such a document.
They consciously cleared the invoices.
Another group of manufacturers of fake invoices are those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about HUF 4 million on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
According to the prosecution, one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, convinced the manager of the Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
Similarly, the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation, collaborated with Zuschlag and his accomplices, which in 2003 provided invoices worth approximately HUF 5 million to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület Association, with no real economic activity behind.
There was no movement of capital either, as they then cancelled the prepared invoices but forgot to include this entity in their documents.
The next group of fake invoice manufacturers include those who have some connection with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the defendant of the Ukrainian manager of the Budapest-based Delta Trio SL, who dealt with fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computers.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that issued invoices on behalf of the company for Atlasz, for Hoppa and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány charging the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because - according to the defendant - they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, as at the request of his accomplice lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, sent invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations associated with Zuschlag: for Atlasz and for Y-Generáció.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Office of the Prosecutor considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the invoice amount.
This man even took advantage of the company in command Szi-Beri to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont competition.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a contest in January 2006 to Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
From the contest they obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the contest.
For this not to be discovered, they submitted to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will probably report in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor's Office - the course of forgery of the invoices.
The most interesting thing will be the confession of János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so to the present.
The question is: what interest do you have to do it?, because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists reached an agreement with him so that Zussi would assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied him.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of much higher value, who never returned the money, walked freely or at least could wait in their own home for the sentence, he has no chance for that.
Psychology of Overlays: Why do we spend more money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York discovered the economics of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in Science magazine, people do not want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played the lottery, the other participated in an auction and in the meantime, the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment were examined using the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI).
In both games the participants could earn money, but during the auctions, where it is fundamental to bet more than the other, the loss of the game intensified the functioning of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-prize" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention in order not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet against a person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was promised that if they won, they would receive 15 dollars more prize.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in the event of losing the auction the members of the group lost even that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, checking the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the group playing "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
So far, they explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation" - established Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to your doctor?
Around five hundred million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death in Hungary.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 are treated because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; they are characteristic of the infection of the liver and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses dependent on the pathogen are spread through two main forms: Hepatitis A and E by food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), Hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body moods (sperm, vagina mood, saliva).
It is recommended that travellers should be protected by vaccination against virus A and B, and no vaccines are available against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifest by means of poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this, jaundice appears in the skin and in the white of the eyes, the excrement becomes clear, dark urine and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year one million people die in the world of cancer and cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that, according to the calculations, only one in ten infected patients receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can cause liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Premature recognition, systematic medical control, is therefore very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
There are currently some 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease has healing if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus of the body, so it can suppress the contagion and prevent cancer.
September 30th is the World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt less who believes in God?
According to a recent research, religious faith has a soothing effect that also alleviated the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
In the context of this singular experiment, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shock, while everyone was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the scanning technique of the human brain, it was verified that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
This experiment is the first in the series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University also participate alongside academics.
The analysis occurred as follows; they fixed a sparkling instrument to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to fix their gaze on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century and the Lady of the arm of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a reassuring effect.
The patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts during that period while observing the religious theme painting or the other.
The Catholics affirmed that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected" people, "were reassured and peace reigned in their hearts".
When they watched the religious picture they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so shocking you can get a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person they feel very positively about, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really changes our personality" - Wright added.
After these formidable results there is only one question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if Madonna de Leonardo or another painter of her own size were shown to the faithful?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary produce even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On its tenth birthday, Google can say: it can be found both in people's pockets and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors they visit and what they are interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is not yet enough.
On the other hand the skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to be able to meet the original goals of Google's founders: "We gather all the information from the world in a system!".
According to the Google leader, the company even after ten years of work that revolutionized the world is still in the early stages of the effort to be able to process all the information.
To the question that what is going to happen within five years Schmidt answered like this: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would be best for me?" - however, the software will not be able to answer seemingly simple questions until there is enough information from users.
Not all netizens are aware that while browsing the Web, the search keywords, IP addresses, and pages where they passed through are accurately stored.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-consult what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic will be based on the Recommendations, on which the system will offer us products and services based on previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who worry about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that they not only retain, but in justifiable cases also give to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of netizens.
The most discussed example of recent times was perhaps coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, when Google handed over to the Brazilian government the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify paedophiles.
On the other hand, Internet users who care about people's rights, in May, were relieved when the company together with EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated to the court that he was right in his dispute with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google will not be forced, through any of the constitutional points, to supply any kind of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to secure on the pretext of strengthening the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand web addresses and a few thousand search phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory the opinion about Google: it is criticized by those who fear to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy, their privacy is impaired when they start using Google's services, and they rebel against it as against multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the North American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users of other countries, see in them the future generation, the "coupling of the vanguard", not so much to their rival, Microsoft, catalogued by their Windows as conqueror of the World, however much they both struggle for the same goal.
This can happen because Google unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the program package free, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because geeks see with precision the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that occurred precisely because of one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, about leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: showing ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, after which they can be included in a tracking system such as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, can also have a blog, in which the most recent photo galleries that are stored in the Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
We can know many cases from which it turns out that, for example, the bride, seeing the flow of photographs the next morning of the common friends, finds out who she spent the night with her fraudulent boyfriend or they can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the management of the company: one thing is certain, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
A person's "on line" life is what she shows of herself - this is the definition that hides behind the behavior of the youth of our day.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least wants to dodge Google's monopoly, can do it (starting with the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but leaves no trace).
There are many people who don't want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from being found, but Google's "on-line" apps can be replaced, from text writing software to image and news reading applications with alternative versions that don't connect to giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion almost openly expects the day Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of 156 billion dollars is worth more than the IBM (140 billion dollars), the Intel (124 billion dollars) or the Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while the services that are introduced more and more quickly cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also to numerous other software developers.
Critical observers, however, will find the contradictions alarming as well: for example, the senior management strongly rejected the employee's protest after doubling the company's child care price, considered too expensive the unlimited number of employees' feeding, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to pressure from the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement filtered all information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new services in advance, but only when it is ready to work, which if it is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to revolutionize the world: while some believe that Google's scanning and archiving of books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the U.S. Supreme Court, others fear its health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, will be able to provide a good raw material for writers of science fiction works, the Scroogled, novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in Orwelian form that future, in which a man only of the data of Google can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the fingerprints of the author of the double murder in the city of Ozd.
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ozd who, according to substantiated suspicion, helped to erase the traces of the crime - the spokesman of the Public Order Commission of Borsod province said on Tuesday.
The young women recognized the crime they were charged with, and they are currently charged with violators of the crime.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency are two girls - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is charged with the crime of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23 - year - old owed a large sum to a 53 - year - old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he quoted his creditor at the headquarters of a company in Ozd, where he killed him and then also killed the victim's 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI reports, the young man was prepared long before to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the crime scene.
The police analyze with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Presented Offer to Buy Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech kroner - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, although the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
Ninety-nine per cent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which in a few months wishes to sell 60 per cent of the shares.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the Polish offer has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far been offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that, in the future, the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Bank Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the deepening international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 September".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - The Republic of Rome believes - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill made hastily, whose objective is to give solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", which was referred to by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more correct to speak of a "second 11 September".
According to part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo's view, the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was the one that led the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing, and this will then affect the entire world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote the danger arose that Washington would not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - precisely when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
You cannot ignore this threat - says the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still throw life belts at staggering financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if as the dominoes crumble even more bank, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
It is necessary in the long term for the Member States of the European Union to put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received only on Monday more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that the concerns are increasingly real that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not taken seriously the crisis that is going on like an old continent.
The "saviours" will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid a greater evil?
The smart car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not imitation of the sensors of obstacles existing in nature?
For example, that of the bumblebees.
In a surprising project presented at CETEC in Japan, the bumblebees gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the BR23C-type robotic driving system imitating nature, to which they gave the characteristics of the bumblebees, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our protective safety capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of RP and development and research.
The eyes composed of the bumblebees that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees play an important role.
To copy the function of composite eyes, the engineers used the laser length measurement system.
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the vehicle microprocessor that immediately transforms into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction by turning the wheels to the extent necessary.
Unlike any system currently in existence, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the robot of the vehicle could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the project of the robot of vehicles.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the protective safety cap, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bumblebee does to avoid other bumblebees.
This process must be carried out in one opening and closing the eyes.
However, unlike the bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the turning direction of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for the bumblebees to avoid other bumblebees, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotary movement and the acceleration in addition to the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and are higher in energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, much less the storage capacity.
This device in every second should only process some input signals and react as the case may be.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
No memories of gigabytes, no megabytes.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which, according to Nissan's calculations, can be incorporated into the series models within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding the obstacles in his path.
He already has this dearest child's name.
The written version of the $700 billion bail-out package law has been prepared and will be implemented in several phases in order to purchase bad bank loans.
Half the money will be spent in the first phase.
According to East Coast schedule during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, the leaders of the Congress reached an agreement around the financial rescue package of $700 billion in total, after several days of discussion - reported the Reuters.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American Congress, stating that the agreement is only to be formalized in a document.
The commitment made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the compromise stated: this program will work and will be efficient but more measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy car around.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (i.e. before 2 p.m. on Monday, according to Central European time), without causing a spectacular jump in the bags.
On the bill called the emergency law for economic stabilization in 2008, the first Monday will vote for the American Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted Pelosi and then the White House also welcomed the news on the deal.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
The program is different from the Bush administration's original proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy bad quality credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using 250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy securities of credit fund, bad rating and the destination of another $100 billion depends on the decision of the president.
This programme will be monitored by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion can be spent after a new Congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and securities credit fund securities, as well as other "poisonous" credits as well.
The purchase can be made by auctions or directly - the competent persons of the ministry have informed.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated: The law thus secures the necessary financial means, which can even reach $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the US financial system, be concerned with the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could lead to the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks that are in trouble and waiting for the help of the State will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the American slang simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain specific cases will payments be limited, and limitations depend on the form of assistance provided by the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on the gold parachutes, unless the failed boss of the bank retires.
By directly buying bad credits, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that bosses' compensations are not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations relate only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in American history that will be in force a legal limitation on the income of directors-general - said the Democrat Barney Frank, president of the congressional commission, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from the banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they will ultimately be able to make profits with the transaction as soon as the economy is recovered and with it the bank.
According to the bill in the next five years the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to return the losses of the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course on both sides there were those who expressed reservations about the project.
This is not what the American citizens entrusted us, that is, the taxpayers' dollars are not being protected - said the Republican Congressman of California, Darrell Issa.
His democrat colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: the measures were urgent by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Won't you need a visa next year to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement to come into force around January 12th - the Foreign Minister spoke about it in Chicago, before the Hungarian residents there.
In his opinion " practically everything depends on the timely construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic."
At the same time, he warned that the entry requirement would disappear in the new system, but tourists must register before they leave the country of origin.
Starting today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is having talks in Washington.
He will be interviewed by the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice giving him the Middle Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international political advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the bank's bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major US parties secured their support on Sunday for the administration's $700 million banking aid program, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The representatives of Congress and the administration, after a several-day marathon negotiations, on Sunday morning announced: an agreement of principles was reached on the bank's financial rescue package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and thawing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, with economic issues in the forefront, Obama again gained some advantage and disappeared McCain's advantage that he had gained after the Republicans' convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy for vice president.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly pass the 700 billion dollar package bill.
He stressed that the proposal included those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and responsibly (...) there is a threat to your employment, to your savings as well as whole industries and to the stability of the entire economy," he said to a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to describe McCain's economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain, he explained that "we will all swallow this hard (...) but doing nothing is simply not a viable way."
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control commission to the Minister of Fines and the limitation of executive compensation, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, instead he consulted daily with the minister.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that congressmen will probably vote on the bill by Monday.
German-speaking press review
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the most conscious voters became - says the Der Spiegel about the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a reddish coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the left-wing German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours his parents", analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polytologist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo had taken office.
Social-Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are the ones who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process was completed that had been foreseen for almost ten years: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, even during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years now, but at the pace they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of education and the settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the voters of the CSU.
Modernisation also increases the possibilities, and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the most conscious, critical and stubborn voters became.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks it was the conventional groups of citizens who moved further away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, the high school graduates and the graduates.
Thus, less than 40 percent of the support for the CSU was postponed.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper of Vienna: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved in matters of coalition" - deals with the confusing situation of internal politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, the Greens do not yet want to consult on the coalition.
Elections have already been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, party leaders barely let any of their stalls see.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that it is possible to collaborate between the two parties - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question that if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of ÖVP, in the post of Vice-Chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to red offers.
He said cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
It is still open in the party if they choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must undoubtedly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
The President of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider, was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take on the government's responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: Breaking the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, its host is France, which this year is also President-in-Office of the European Union.
Livia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations against Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights.
Járóka - according to the press bureau of the Fidesz group of deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Gypsies stay out of the labour market in the first place because of their low level of schooling.
"Most young Gypsies have not finished middle school and because of the poor quality of basic education, only a small part of them can obtain a university degree."
Járóka further stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investment in early education for Roma children can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise these issues widely among both Roma and non-Gypsies.
The sooner a gypsy student starts school, the more opportunities they will have to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and to ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education" - highlighted Livia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary in order to accelerate immediately the processes of school disintegration, for which it is of fundamental importance the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights", Járóka demanded.
The objective of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organised annually since last year's Berlin meeting held in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October a decision will be made on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral defeat, no head has yet been cut off at the peaks of the Bavarian CSU, the debate on personal issues has been postponed for the time being.
Erwin Huber, party president and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister are still in office, but it is not known how long grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the party's extraordinary congress to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the so-called duo let me guess: they do not cling so much to their posts.
They wanted to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and their grassroots organization, who one day after the Bavarian tsunami demanded personal consequences due to the loss of an absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the coup attested against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria, which accounts for 18 percent of the German GDP.
Although in the southern province, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to predominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to make a coalition with someone.
As a first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's potential successors, also holds a position in the small intelligence group that initiates negotiations with the Liberal FDP and the Right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that on the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was exploited for the Huber-Beckstein duo's coup and then cruelly erased from the stage to the ambitious local politics.
The CSU's top leaders are now investing all their energy to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition he will also receive an active role Stoiber who until now has been moving the ropes in the background, the former provincial government chief and former president of the CSU rated 28 September as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the Bundestag's September 2009 elections, Merkel will not be able to be a chancellor unless they are able to enhance together the CSU that played a significant role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly hide his disappointment at the failure, the losses of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great Berlin coalition.
This, of course, is relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After Sunday's elections, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that Alexandr Lukashenko guarantees in the country, instead according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
While the country's 10 million-member, ten-per-cent legislature, more than a decade ago, has no opposition, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time would "allow" the entry of some opposition deputies into parliament.
So the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that it originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the import of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the pipeline that passes through the country - wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give entry permission to Lukashenko and the other high-level politicians for having a political regime considered anti-democratic.
It was a sign of distension when the OSCE, in assessing the electoral campaign, placed more emphasis on positive phenomena than on mistakes - such as the ban on participation imposed on one third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE Monday's primary report even criticized the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has already considered the two regions to be independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - said to our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime fears allowing the entry of even one opponent into that weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan to organise protest demonstrations when it sees the results, rather it tries to send the voters their message about the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties before its distribution, but even so I see that there are more and more those who support the change among the elderly also - said Milinkevich, referring to the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, do not consider it adequate even the retirees, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security that "looks like the silence of the cemeteries" - Milinkevich said.
The Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, described the elections as democratic.
Serguei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in facts", so that the lack of opposition is nothing but testimony to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on you have breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
but from today it starts with this measure against the person who files and then goes to the bar to have a coffee at work time.
This novelty has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services" the minister says.
"A new season of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is Reformism," Brunetta underlines again.
The Chigi Palace completes the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from the symbolic point of view".
No resistance has been found on the part of the employees, says the secretary general: "It has been a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on the part of them".
In short, no more breakfast on working hours; no more coffee and half moons.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
from Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences due to diseases of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is to say 60,000 more people to work in one year".
And adds that it is necessary to make the Public Service more effective
Italian, "which wage dynamics - the minister explains - in the last 8-10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and well above the inflation rate".
For now millions of public employees have joined forces to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
"While the minister of the Civil Service shows the numbers, the least absenteeism of work due to causes of illness – writes the association of consumers – the people of the 'vague workers' are constantly increasing.
There are millions in Italy actually the correct and productive public administration employees who have joined forces to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree."
In particular, the Tar will reply to the exclusion of economic treatments aggregated by illness due to service; the extension of the time slots in which the medical check visits of the sick employee are carried out; and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures testifying to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the same tragic news from these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association mutilated and disabled by the work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "great appreciation for the continued commitment of associations to prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and public awareness".
"It has manifested itself, a 'suffer', sincerely shared, facing tragedies that, by their dimensions, provoke the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is given to the numerous initiatives promoted in school for a more direct awareness among young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm about social gravity, to implement and improve legislation.
For his part the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini has emphasized "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitute an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all the institutions a determined effort to put an end urgently".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive," said Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "tendence to decline" to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when attention diminishes that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level too little is done to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our opinion - Mercandelli has emphasized - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of the workers, and this from the world of the school ".
"It serves a further effort - it has added - because it concerns the communication and the awareness of the public.
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary guardianship envisaged for the victims of work" and "the care diversion towards which the system is heading in recent years".
"The aim is to restore the insurance guarantee to the worker - he has added - because the fate of the person who falls victim does not have to depend on the gift arranged by the legislator every time".
Mp3 players under charge, put the hearing at risk
Listening to high volume music for a long time using portable music devices like Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
It is the European Commission's point that, in a press release in Brussels, it cites the opinion of the newly identified emerging health risk Scientific Commission (Csserri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical apparatus weekly for more than an hour a day having the apparatus at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I'm concerned that such a large number of young people who often use portable music devices and high acoustic cell phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific evidence – EU responsibility follows – a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is to raise consumer awareness and make this information publicly available.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and take the step with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that this gives rise to.
"Scientists - the EU executive concludes - confirm that it is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related devices".
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concern is increasing as the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit this damage by using solutions such as reduction of levels and time of exposure to noise.
In its view, the Ue Scientific Committee points out that users of portable musical apparatus listen at high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limit for maximum noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which was established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Termas de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors were closed in March, the council and the municipal council evaluated analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bubble" of the Municipality and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to emphasize Alemano – it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then be endorsed.
There is no leftover position of roles, only the will to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
The work will disappear in March, because this experience must have a precise time-limit.
In June – the intendant announces – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that their opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Politics is almost always crushed in the ordinary management and in emergencies that turn back and forth.
On the contrary, we want to look further and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
The mayor of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost Roman citizens a euro and will serve to involve and reason the best minds expressed by the capital".
For Alemanno, in fact, "we need to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or motionless, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which we absolutely need, thinking in a unitary spirit about its future".
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome," will not be limited only to the present communal boundaries but will look beyond it" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must develop as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He has written a well-known American politician who is interested in becoming independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and tube relations (as he also does today gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
has written a Miami lady on a Web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great face of stone: he believes he won the highest office of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!"
They are actually attacks that do not say much; they are clearly racial in nature and do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And there are also polls; everyone says Obama won and with a good advantage.
Here, too, there is one who speaks to the heart but not to the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote we will know well who will vote the American patriot.
It comes out one side of the American mentality kept covered to the last.
"Say whatever you want, we'll figure out where to put the cross, whether about Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if you win Obama, we'll leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the democratic is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were Bush's mistakes during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and kicked her home in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
Likewise, Iraq for the majority has been Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes over the post of George W will have a huge duty to develop.
Use, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "killer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Today, however, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism is not to be reduced substantially as the majority of the public understands it.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many viewed as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope of "doing something good" for journalism.
The biggest break today in American journalism is between those who run the newspapers – i.e. the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
Fifty-six per cent of executives at the national level are confident that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23 per cent.
For some, this has to do with "work security."
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% at the national level.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of "take it or leave it".
Directors almost always receive good wages, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, but retirement and social security.
For holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third year to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by admission, are "infirm" followed during the year.
It's all about the weather.
UNIPOL: ROME TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATE
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the field of research on the contra pact relating to the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the process of arrest at his charge, last week, he obtained home release, transforming it into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate could travel the route of the city of the province to a room of the capital.
According to the court, these trips (by which the pm has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million plan of salvation launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this one, more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save the economy.
It gives us a confirmation yesterday's New York Times informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, always more divided between its old soul of the East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the states of Central and South.
The soul, in fact, that has become powerless with the vote of the one who spoke at first.
This just quoted is just an example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here.
Whether in the United States or in Europe for a long time the crisis seems to function as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate are solidified and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the updating, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual state-sovereign category in relation to a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions- finance which have, if they have strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically worldwide but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or they don't have much to say: the crucial test is The European Union which, divided as always between different interests and different state strategies, fails to decide any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the grant of funds: from the moment you reach the court it is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market will likely and no organization will ever be able to dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a factor very related to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of immaterial technology, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will have to do more and more with things that are not immaterial, such as water, crops and oil.
All things that, look, can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth but are equally united in absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself as sovereign, certainly possesses many more letters regarding who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a post without crops, without oil and without water.
I've come to the second novelty, but I'm predicting a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take control of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing, economically-relevant leaderships inadequate with many dark zones.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in a growing number.
There seems to be more and more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites until now in the boom, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the understanding exception of ending, to have made their own time and to be more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneanly feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an "electoral revolution" or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and layers also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do with it).
There is the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say, make it ever more difficult to understand and then to represent, what from today is taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and agitates potentially in excess.
Faced with all this, talking about a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Beat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like the spider man.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to have glued a body of 100 kilos on a vertical wall.
THE STUDY – The American journal Science has published the discoveries of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the feet of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal a perfect adherence.
Tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful on the legs of this reptile and at the same time "it easily takes off from the walls," explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
WALK OVER THE PAREDES? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through the walls exactly like spider man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may have to do with aerospace engineering.
For now, no superheroes.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - Also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented a sticker made of micro fibers like hair that self-clean dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, mainly consumed in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken simultaneously with some drugs, their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing as the case may be, efficiency with serious consequences for health.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices be packed that fresh associated with the taking of some medicines David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying the beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of the patients.
Grapefruit juice was already on the charge because it was held responsible for increasing some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicines to toxic levels.
PHARMACOS A RIESGOS – The same Italian drug agency had reported in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to pay attention to drink in case a drug is being taken, such as to Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY PUMEL – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan:"These discoveries in general are pointed out to the various agencies of the international and national drug that eventually provide for changing the information notes of the drug.
That is why we must always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us be impressed, ask the doctor or the pharmacist clearly", stressed the expert of the agency Ansa.
Paul Krugman's Novel of Economics
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his models of trade and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Keynesian neo who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publisher of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of Bush's administration's economic and foreign policy decisions.
A few months after the attack on 11 September 2001, on those days that Enron was breaking, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggers much controversy and that for several years came reproached to the economy, but that has now proved to be accurate.
"I'm surprised and a little annoyed by how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a divulgator with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical against the excesses of the liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source of personal productivity suite that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by the volunteer developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: to the welcome screen and to the less coarse magazine interface, more consistent others are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also put to multi-function with the Office 2007, Open Office suite is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it by email, or the possibility to import the PDF file into the graphic processing module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text writer.
The Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version that has been in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request the installation cd can also be sent home or to work.
And if the theme of the free can be a hook for dissemination in the houses, it is in the business sphere that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in the schools.
And even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened, are not lacking.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video write the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eats in the case of the known Access is the program that allows to work on the database; and lastly Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case on the tour of France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third ranked and winner of the best climber's shirt.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive runner to the Third Generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
Kohl's blood champions' tests are among those performed in the last few weeks in the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry lab.
If the counter evidence confirms that it is positive, the Austrian will lose third place to the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positive doping to the Third Generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, awarding himself the shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES ASK, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy of country of emigrant has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with hostility.
Is this transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? That is what the New York Times is asking in a long article that has devoted to the debate on the issue of racism in Italy starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, murdered the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case shows what the New York Times defines as the "Northern Paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are recorded, but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support of the North League."
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also the new legislation wanted by the League tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegals is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Tendence marked by the Pope who by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has asked the State and the church to work together to combat racism".
Student victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to Sunia's latest survey, the tenants' union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study for a large part of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to bear – explains the head of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong demand has totally distorted the market to the point of triggering a process of general increase even for residents".
Apart from the fact that, in most cases, rental offers contain a number of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, without a fee limit, linked sub-contracts.
For Sunia there is a need for extraordinary interventions which, through the revision of taxation, can regulate prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Black Band area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 euros for an individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked for approximately 600 euros for a single room and 450 euros for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It only makes savings if you change the peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina area, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed 300/450 euros are served, for a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed you will receive 250/350 euros, at least 350 euros for an individual.
In the smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a higher weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and non-communal students is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25/30 per cent of the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradise, the cities cancel the historic halls
Historical cinemas close favoring the Multiplexes.
"A city without cinemas in a blind city is like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the major Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, which with the birth of the great methicons on the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono-rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear almost always are historical places, full of memory, "it is as if a friend died, a acquaintance with whom a piece of place and so much emotion was shared", observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won cousin Oscar and the grand jury prize in Cannes, which counted the poetry of a provincial cinema and the nostalgia for the way of living the cinema that maybe lost forever.
The figures given by Anec, the main association of merchants, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and most of them are paid for in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are as first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas less, following Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for its disappearance is the multiplex, these three Italian regions are their own that have recorded the largest number of new methicone cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally," notes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to methicones.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favour of traders: the previous debt of the state is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year".
Interestingly the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned by the closures, decided to repair itself with the signature of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono room is in the historical center that on the periphery.
Among the rules provided for there are means of tax facilitation for managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will have special parking fees.
"It's an initiative I like," notes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is true, that in order to contrast the extra power of methicones, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that was always important to me: the closure of Bagheria's cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Paradise cinema", which I already thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass through the Rialto or the Quirinale of via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, in order not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side».
Link between politics and 'ndrangheta, has been arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the municipal elections for those interested in the Piromalli Cossack."
The accusations made by the judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria against the mayor and deputy mayor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrio and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for Mafia association, are heavy.
Also arrested is Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson's lawyer, the same name as the boss, who has already been convicted by a criminal Mafia association and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Despite any moral and legal norms, and of good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with attorney Piromalli.
"The Mafia family would have been allowed – the judges write – to officially enter the interior of the municipality, facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between bad organized life there is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the Mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'drangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
This morning's arrests are added to those of last July after police had announced the head cut of the Piromalli mob family.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, as early as 1991 and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been sunk to administer the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Udc's lieutenant at the time of the dissolution, had been elected as head of a centre-right coalition after the strike in May 2006.
I exploit a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I am calling into question the Deputy Minister of the Interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even asked for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration on the interests of the Mafia families" emerges.
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage
It is an exterminated field that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now discovering it, the world's largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources over which the great like Chevron look.
The possibility of collecting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, together with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil was low in 1980, the idea of taking advantage of marine energy was removed, but now environmental cases and the new increase in oil give momentum to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electrical need could be covered by implants that exploit the motion of the waves of the sea.
This amount would be twice as much as currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would also be currents and tides.
Giants to attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in Northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies who have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying technology on ocean energy – he has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the ha to the American oil colossus to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal – and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It's a pretty important sign, considering that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and President Bush has recently activated a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts like those Portuguese or the Scots are small and do not seem to create great problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of bonded goods.
The force of the waves, which moves the boas upwards and downwards, becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type under development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a mall and a parking lot, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are tides, turns the paddles of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the Development of Electrical Energy, deserves at this time the potential of tides.
While it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is above all about the energy of tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coast, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and an investment of 35 million is planned for 2009.
