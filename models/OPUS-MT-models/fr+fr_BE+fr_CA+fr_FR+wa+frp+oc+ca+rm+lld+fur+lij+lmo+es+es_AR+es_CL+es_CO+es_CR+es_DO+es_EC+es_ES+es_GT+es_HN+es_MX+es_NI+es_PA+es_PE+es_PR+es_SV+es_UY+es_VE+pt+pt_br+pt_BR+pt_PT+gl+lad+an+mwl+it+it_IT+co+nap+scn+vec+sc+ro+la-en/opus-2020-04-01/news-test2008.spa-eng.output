European inflation slipped in food
Accelerated inflation in the euro area is primarily due to the sharp rise in food prices.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, recording - after 2.6 per cent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent - announced the EU Statistical Office based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only 3 percent likely - the Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decline, together with rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least about two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "we have to negotiate" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene later on.
The inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, hit the record of twelve years; while in Spain it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation fell in the euro area as a result of rising food and energy prices.
Term wheat levies have increased by 88 per cent and soya levies have reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching nearly 100 dollars a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will rise from 2.1 per cent today to 2.5 per cent, while by 2009 it will already fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, yet the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by the beginning of December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while the Gallup never experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the safe voters of the parties - due to the greater firmness of the voters of the opposition - would mean more than two-thirds support (71 percent) compared to the support of a fifth for the socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach even the limit necessary to have some parliamentary scandal: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the safe voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the lowest point before - it has never been so high, 41% the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation particularly bad, while another 46% believe the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as the next year is concerned, the majority of the population has the deterioration of the situation and only one tenth expects improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of those consulted, more than any previous Gallup survey, felt that the President of the Government was doing his job wrong than well.
13 percent of those consulted trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has 38 percent of those consulted.
54 per cent of the population does not trust the Head of Government at all and 27 per cent does not trust the President of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks that it is possible to control the dissatisfaction experienced vis-à-vis the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year 35 per cent felt that it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, this ratio is currently only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) believe that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the participation question answered that they would be sure to participate and another 20 percent said that they are likely to participate.
By comparison, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" only 55 per cent of the population would surely participate and another 15 per cent would probably believe their participation. On the basis of the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt of the result of the popular consultation.
Seventy-four percent of the population would disapprove of the payment of tuition fees, 79 percent of the medical consultation service, and 84 percent of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of education rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has five times its prices
The average increase in price levels was maintained by 16 per cent in the hypermarkets of the Budaörs commercial gold triangle, with the difference that this year VAT has not been increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in Budaörs's trade triangle of gold the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a much higher growth than the HUF thousand.
As prices in food supermarkets had already been "dispared" in December last year, so there was no drastic increase in percentage compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below the HUF 9 000, today they cannot do so for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003 this basket cost HUF 6800.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the Central Bureau of Statistics data, although in Auchan we also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with a two-litre redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan's basket it was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, regarding last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan by about 18 percent the prices listed in the Napi basket.
Comparing the values of last year's most expensive basket with that of this year's cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year's cheapest and most expensive basket has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so that during last Christmas prices felt the increase in VAT.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade, the supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of a product's circulation, he may lose an important profit in the margin that fits the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the basket of Napi reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF than the value recorded in 2006, while at the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, since the highest price of now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, catastrophic growth in prices was recorded in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of essential consumer goods grew by more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the Central Bureau of Statistics figures: this office, in the case of some staple foods, recorded a price increase of more than 30 per cent over the 12-month period.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to Napi's basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case only 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, being able to impose a drastic price increase even on multinationals.
The hypermarkets do not complain in the commercial triangle of gold, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers in the three shops visited no longer care about prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking preserved foods by pallets.
On the morning of Wednesday, in the three stores large queues were formed in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because income falls short of their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals it saves with disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections have been registered in hospitals, primarily due to the misuse of antibiotics.
The prevailing hygiene conditions in hospitals, overcrowded beds and overloaded staff do not favor infection control - says the head doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre department.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, a MRSA infection has been diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
A person injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient shortly afterwards had to return to the hospital as a result of MRSA infection and since then no major surgery has been possible due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System - said Karolina Böröcz, head doctor of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
This means that the number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has been safely recorded in hospitals, but no information is available.
About two thirds of infections (683 cases) are caused by MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g., inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easily treated.
However, once it is overly or improperly applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics, become highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria and rapidly spread under inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or septicaemia in the first place to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the weakened body, to the elderly or to people of low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic-resistant
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff attends to them in rubber gloves and mask and there are antibiotics suitable for their treatment" - said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but even so infection cannot be avoided in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA hospital infections in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of training and contagion with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the diseases that carry MRSA in their body.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come out in public light when MRSA infections are already occurring visible in the patient - said the head doctor of the epidemiologic center.
The European Union makes strict commitments to the application of antibiotics in human medicine and national directives are also in place to treat infections and pathological conditions.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is directed, i.e., microbiological tests should be conducted to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent in the case of walking patients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
Saves with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through health personnel.
Therefore, handwashing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is infected by drip transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least for a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately it can also be experienced - Karolina Böröcz added - that in hospitals with less favourable economic situation is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater probability for the infection.
In Karolina Böröcz's view, where appropriate prevention measures are being implemented, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so it is fought in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
The program appears to be successful, according to data provided, MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
Denying the blood alcohol control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report has been prepared on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of District XXII.
The possibility of driving drunk or in a stunned state can be excluded the then resigned commander of the police of the XXII district, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a passerby - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, after the expert report on the case has been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary blood alcohol control that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before getting behind the wheel.
The then chief of the police station of the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle by doubling to Kossuth Lajos street of the XXII district, hit a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the area designated for pedestrians.
(This latter fact, that is, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way when doubling.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
The district police officer resigned and applied for his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is carried out by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit limit agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total value of €400 million to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as energy.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance transport and environmental protection projects in the Hungarian budget, to be implemented from the Cohesion Fund grant, of which the parties had already signed a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this Hungarian objective, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, the decision will be taken later when the credit agreement is extended.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will use mainly for the Innovation and Research Project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the issue of the construction of the 4th Metro line.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary completes with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro, they will again address the issue of whether or not to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this could take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charge for keeping the loan at the disposal of the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country mentioned earlier.
What, where and who buys on the EU's even cheaper market, which will be quickly increased?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred goal for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is certainly some Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slopes apartments and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches of Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for properties also in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy properties in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Similarly, the capital Sofia can be attractive, commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive golfing paradises in Europe, so it can be an outstanding destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Precautionary investors are therefore already making their purchases, for example in the surroundings of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their life and way of life.
Most of the customers are English, but also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in skiing paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to install here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in bad condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to then renew them.
They require good communication and access, and for them the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor is important.
The second category is the buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group consists of real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital properties is growing steadily, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they have experienced an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of real estate considerably exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to the Minister of the Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, meetings at the expert level will be concluded on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue negotiations at the ministerial level on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world deliberate on the Bali Roadmap, which provides for post-emission reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
There are currently lively discussions on this issue between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not wish to negotiate on precise figures for the time being, although it tends to agree that, compared to the 1990 situation, emissions of greenhouse gases will decline by 25 to 40 per cent until 2020.
Another major theme of the conference is whether or not industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological assistance to countries in need.
There was also agreement on aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, under the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Piac es Profit".
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by the 1990 level, regardless of whether or not the "after 2012 agreement" will be signed, and is willing to commit to reducing even 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in line with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries signatories to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol pledged to decrease by 5.2 per cent, within which the then 15 EU Member States pledged to meet 8 per cent of the decline.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent over the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will meet - says the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
Much is at stake in Bali, since in two years' time the international agreement on climate policy will have to be signed in the long term, because otherwise, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed to after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emissions reduction system, whose need was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the international scientific association of the UN dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and would not prevent an increase of more than 2°C in the Earth's average temperature, which scientists believe would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish footage of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: Special Units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban - reported the BBC.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar's general operating body, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are already 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been loaded in this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "headquarters defence" and publishes videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the Community of British Nations (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had loaded the videos with recruitment targets, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the real objective of the British army's presence abroad.
This kind of propaganda hardly costs anything compared to conventional recruitment television spots - the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - on the other hand, inevitably they have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the raison d'être of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned that, in addition to the carefully edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear in the distributor, for example on the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak as a maximum of losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in real operations have been uploaded to the Internet from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruiting with free downloadable shooting video games called America's Army, in which in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers.
Tomb and salty cake at the Christmas party of ministries
It does not seem very sentimental the Minister of Labor Mónika Lamperth: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to fire 2007 with salted cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its feast with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with a ton and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how power is fun.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the Ministry's workers.
On the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts and for the Christmas of the Missionaries, family members of the soldiers who currently carry out missions abroad will be invited. A reception will also be offered for the press.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the holiday environment at the end of the year.
The National Agency for Development (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The ETF party will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4,320 000 HUF and of the six hundred ministry workers expected the presence of approximately three hundred and fifty.
At the festival of the portfolio will reign a Christmas atmosphere, will also perform artists and there will be draw of tomola.
The Christmas of the ANF cost HUF 4 700 000 and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost HUF 1 million, the rest of the budget was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the complete building of the Teatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we cannot communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building housed not only the festival of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of the day of Lucia on December 7.
Their CNAJ did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the Minister's greetings and after dinner there was live dance music.
Replying to the question of [origo] they reported: to attend the dance it was not obligatory to dress or dress at night.
Health, work and local government portfolios are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
On the other hand, Labour Minister Monika Lamperth does not wait for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year work meeting.
It is attended by one hundred and eighty guests who - as the press department reported - will have only coffee and salted cake, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai, will instead simply offer with his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own event hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The holiday party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget the reception will be paid with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse, but also by the afternoon schedule of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year reception on January 20, at the Ministry will not hold Christmas.
The reception will be held in the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio communicated, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the 100 guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception standing, to which will be invited only the specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary.
These receptions are held every year, begin with a brief greeting speech from the minister and end with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas parties - this is what the corresponding press departments communicated to [origo].
They were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry ' s Christmas celebrations in the press department of the environmental portfolio.
What is known is that for the festival to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Commissions will set up a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the Monday strike that will last indefinitely.
On Saturday there will be a protest rally, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - there will be work stoppage.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, as rail transit will be completely stopped and the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike until 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike that will be held jointly with the National Federation of Workers' Commissions.
The strike commission of the LIGA and the National Union of Engineers will also be set up to coordinate Monday's actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating unions will strike indefinitely, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike started.
If the National Assembly disapprove of the public health law, trade unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the National Assembly's Monday agenda, it is also possible that only the public health law will be voted on during the very late hours of the night, or perhaps near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start on Monday, there will have to be significant difficulties in transport: on the railways it will stop working indefinitely, in the morning a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the long-distance bus transport of the companies Volán may stand.
At the same time, half the roads will be closed in many parts of the country.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike for indefinite time, others for definite time.
Until the afternoon of Thursday the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel on the trains.
According to information received so far, from the start of the day until 1 p.m. the workers of the Collective Transport Company of Budapest, the Budapest Airports from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., will hold a four-hour strike the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the Unions of Educators called for a 2-hour strike and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will take a national strike in alternative hours and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS) that are part of the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal for public health reform and submit a new concept to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation that will come into force next year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, that in the case of advanced pensions the possibility that the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: The Hungarian Guard increases the risk in the country
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of the Political Capital the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in August of this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, from several points of view has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In the company's "risk warning" it is written: in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the worsening of ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic confrontations may occur".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of such an event - the representative of the research institute added.
They stated that all this is due to one of the main shortcomings of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the Roma problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between Gypsies and Hungarians".
This exacerbates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflict erupting - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country".
We are reminded that since the autumn of 2006 the reorganization of the radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has received increasing publicity and impetus and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been formed in Hungary that define themselves as "national self-defence associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defence - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the state" - they add.
They said: all this is done in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
To highlight the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but at the same time it is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring states have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures in certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so the political risks were increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in the same way as the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) of the far right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive riots of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to constitute the guard, with the argument that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, yet the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain gypsy organizations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that Hungarian Gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Political Capital Research Director Attila Juhász to the news agency's question stated: Risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change in risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, by publishing their risk warning.
The party isn't always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that next year will be less - the working days will be reorganized.
Not even in the EU or North America are parties unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between a national holiday, a state holiday and a holiday.
The holiday days mainly relate to religious festivals and historical ephemerals.
We celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter above all so that they can rest those who spent celebrating the old anus.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national festival on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and on October 23, a day commemorating the revolution of 1956.
On August 20 we celebrate the foundation of the State, on May 1 the feast of work, on November 1 and 2 we remember our relatives and friends who died.
In addition, in our country are two-day feasts the Easter of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it often makes a bridge when before or after the party there is only one working day.
In exchange for extended weekends like this, on previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
He is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal rule is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and civil servants.
It is not mandatory, however, for companies and service institutions which, because of their role, work continuously even during public holidays.
This year the order of work can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24 the life in the country is practically stopped, since according to the experiences, most people "make bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our parties will coincide with midday or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First the agenda will be changed around the work party so that then, for four successive days, the workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be working day, so that in return Friday, May 2 is a holiday.
The other change relates to the feast of October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the coming year during the year-end party will be able to rest, since from December 24th it will not be worked anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little disincentives to bitter the lives of your colleagues
Emails we forget to send, audio messages we never receive, innocent lies that pass us without realizing: they are all part of our daily Folklore at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to small discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Tips.
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you've been wanted from the marketing department," says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best he feels it and tries to fix the matter, maybe he calls the marketing department to tell them he forgot to give you the message (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to noisy explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can tarnish your colleagues' lives and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more irritating than when you want to take a document, an office clerk or your phone and you can't find them.
Remember you put the stapler on the table yesterday, but by this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost pen at the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be angry with you for taking away their things.
Do not take envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and run out of time.
Are you gossiping about your colleagues' private lives?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what is he doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to everyone the information (conjecture) you have about your colleagues' private lives!
Don't abuse your colleague's confidence when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, although others also know his things.
You're off sick leave unjustifiably?
When you phone the office and say you're sick and your head hurts unbearablely, you feel bad or good, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think that others should do your job, your unspeakable tasks, your end work.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, you will have to stay at home, contact them, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to confront you with your absence the next day.
Tarareos, risitas, telephone calls
You're in your job, but you're suddenly getting your colleagues' laughs out of it?
Have you involuntarily heard a telephone conversation that would have been better not to hear it?
Don't bother your colleagues with your chattering, singing, talking out loud (less when you do it over their head), kicking, blasphemous constants, expressing your discontent out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not deepening at this time in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or a message!
Don't allude to the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don't watch a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be messy, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation so demands!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car progresses slowly in the usual morning jam.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm up the volume.
Change the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The channel mr2 plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national musical life did not mislead us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it looks completely different this jam when you're listening to Zagar's new album.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are gradually changing the image and even though the rock style garage is back in fashion, breaks guitars, the national pop electro has shown: there are news under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he started his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographic (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider public was aware of the ensemble that initially acted only in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected its first album published in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, classifying Zagar, together with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, capable of being sold also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his set are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether or not they wear this label.
The set reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the early years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient ensemble of Balázs Zságer.
It is well the reference on the airy, on the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds louder, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album in the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the set The Puzzle.
The album includes a real success of the channel mr2 Petõfi which recently broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This radio station took to the ears of radio users the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
For everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: the one you are interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of audience selected for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can also be composed just for sale, making it commercial.
But also a good pop song can arise from sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has larger traditions.
There not only the fifteen-and-twenty-year-old generations attend concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good seeing more and more people attend our concerts.
But we've never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet public expectations, you lose your interest.
hvg.hu: How far do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don't follow his path, although sometimes they try to compare our music to his.
We rather work as a team, trust each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that we compare our work with Yonderboi's music, as many of us started our career in their group and then took another path.
hvg.hu: In the success list of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in relation to this song.
Did you consciously open up with this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great hits and sell our album with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it at the end of the album, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the album and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of good voice soloists from our own national music scene.
Thus was created that choir of six women - namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was later baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you make up exactly how the song or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the album, we thought something was still missing.
The chord attracted the song.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came almost to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I also needed the Divas.
My voice wouldn't have worked that hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and in the album it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's brief solo), they have no role of their own, they sing together and no more loudly than music, so music not only accompanies their songs.
Also on the stage they are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
On the other hand, we consciously did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also deals with it, about us forgetting for a while our ego, who from where has come and where goes, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted others to feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you do the most?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually none, rather at the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to run the groove and then, little by little, everything came to its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I have already "dropped" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
An embezzler disloyal.
This is what Jerome Kerviel, the French banker giant of Société Générale, who also owns the Czech Bank of Commerce, points out.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and certainly with good abilities.
He long ago, unlike all the large Czech banks, intuited the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"It has a fragile character" he heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel's answers according to what the French media, like the newspaper Le Monde, translude, was that it was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in his answers.
Precisely, in the summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity has already seen it coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about the sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income clients or those who had problems with payments in the past and that those clients would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
"When I already won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify it," Kerviel confesses and adds, that he has left nothing for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery was not reached.
He even tricked the bosses, even though the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in their business.
The risk became a benefit
Were you afraid he'd find out?
Rather, no.
"I thought I had won $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did you get so much willpower to risk yourself that way?
In my position, work should be done gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after completing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was handled between $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
I still knew I'd never win as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005 I already observed that they were looking at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this involved a boot mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll leave you.
"This is like a snowball," the police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or rather suspected it.
"As he made money, they closed their eyes."
It's just that, after that, the blow came early this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all footprints.
When he got to work on Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have a vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his file" ended Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to achieve 365 billion
The Ministers of Government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kroner).
This is almost half the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of the seven operational programmes, approximately SEK 125 billion will come out for the regions.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructures that next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly admitted countries that use them least.
Twenty-year penalty for the former President of Nicaragua, decreed the court
On Thursday, Nicaragua's Court of Appeal handed down a 20-year sentence for the country's former president, Arnaldo Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for the loss of 100 billion dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
In spite of this, a while later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest in his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is again in lockdowns.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, he would be more dependent on prison officers if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they brought him back to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how German was constantly transferring money from the government to a company's account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account belonged, in fact, to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that Alemán created to finance his campaign in the 2001 elections.
That's how they approved our budget.
That's right.
The State budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not be allowed not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional, though most influential, view, quietly approved the new law.
It's a great paradox.
Each government starts and ends with every chapter and budget item, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they devote special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State Budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three flaws that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first is the high participation of compulsory laws, called as expenses of the presidents who are not only pensions but also the social benefits that were already approved last year before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not found in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors to be able to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from the taxes, fees and credits of the banks, often issued meaningless obligations with which they disproportionately indebted their municipalities.
In recent years they have been able to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks that they received from the state and privatization.
At present, they do not have this resource.
If we follow only the official and verified facts, we discover that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of what ČSSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to order the state's finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to be indebted.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to nations that within global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why massive social programmes are not necessary, which, unfortunately, in recent years have been unnecessarily inflated with gigantic measures.
And even though they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform do not change, then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, rule who governs it will only be a simple bureaucracy.
By exaggerating a little, we can say that the politicians who govern will become civil servants, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenses of the presidents' expenses.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not spent what they could in the last ten years.
We would not want the politicians who govern to become only civil servants, so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of the government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is capable of obtaining from taxes and fees, the tranquillity for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks Want to Solve the Crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
The Monetary Mark will receive more than one hundred billion dollars through bidding.
In these tenders the banks lower the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will bid forty billion dollars, and then another twenty-four billion dollars will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continued growth of the free capital shortage banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group consulting firm in his client report.
"This coordinated action by central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what is still waiting for them when they decided to take this step," said ABN Amro's leading economist Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems with access to loans and will therefore have to lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they could not reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, London interbank rate that is used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to borrow money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," Reuters, Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting, told the agency.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks helps to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem of the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Environmentalists' debates are amazing
Global climate change affects developing countries in particular.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
Criticism now arose with the closure of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he commented that the debates of the ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations, but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
"There the debates are hardly structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "many times I only encounter the caricature of my ideas."
Interested parties can now learn about their varied views.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that, according to his opinion, he has enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, capable of following and judging a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure, he expressed his thoughts that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement on global warming among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor do they represent potential disasters, and that attempts to influence climate development are useless, ineffective and costly.
Moreover, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
To the questions of those present he repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable environmental advocates but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
On the same subject Klaus spoke in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers were passed the date and therefore were unable to change their old driver's license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials will give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without a valid card.
According to traffic, the card hasn't changed mainly those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of carnets, the offices of the metropolis are full of requests and interest in the new carnet has increased.
The City Council calculates about 2,000 customers per day.
You wait half an hour in the queues.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet been taken out of the new licence.
The issue of a new card lasts 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who must change their licence and do not reach the end of the year, but will go on the roads without the valid licence will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can arrange the violation with a warning.
In the event of an administrative infringement, the fine shall amount to RKK 2,500.
According to the above information, a fine could be imposed on a person who is not going anywhere.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry appealed to the offices for moderate fines of a maximum of one thousand crowns.
According to Ministry of Transport's spokesman, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, driving license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should deliver their driver's license.
Simply bring it or send it by certified mail to municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the meats issued during the years 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driver's license.
Persons with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the licence issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka there are about 2.6 million more documents.
Court reduced the sentence to Berdych's accomplice detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych are going to spend between 13 and 10 years in prison.
The Prague High Court decided as a final maturity the reduction of sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives in the department were going to be fighting organized crime between the ages of 14 and 12.
Against today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also accused in this case, but he is awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance in the first place.
Despite this, he has already been sentenced in other trials to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement of 19 people in the robbery and the Superior Court today dismissed 16 of them.
Most of the accused ' s allegations were rejected by the investigation because they were fabricated cases.
According to the Central Bohemia Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up the robberies, and helped members of the criminal group avoid punishment.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Kořařík.
The charge relates to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as theft is concerned, their victims suffered serious health impacts but are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without weapons permission.
In the home search, the police found pistols, steel core ammunition, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring other trials, and in some cases have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who have for now avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
An account for changing children: 12 million
For changing children in the maternity home the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of Třebič 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostal, disagrees in principle with Veleba's proposal.
"We don't approve of this demand, it's too high," Dostal said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterpart ordered to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescisor value.
We remain in the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dostal stressed.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 kroner for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, the family of Jablon wanted, for each month that they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that the report was prepared at the hospital of the faculty of Motol in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better endured by men although they fought with recriminations for the change of girls.
Women carry it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at the Třebič Maternity House last year, December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered at the end of October to each family 100,000 crowns as compensation for the error committed in the hospital of Třebič that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must extract from the reserve fund and extraordinarily they can ask the administrator for help.
The court so far recognized them with proportionally low compensation, the sums that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Valachia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the Kingdom of Valachia brand.
According to the judge of the Ostrava provincial court, he was the first to use the Kingdom of Valachia brand but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear at the oral hearing today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Valachia, everyone has the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We took about ten years of work after us.
Searching for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
"After years I realized that the project is successful and that for this reason I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Kingdom of Valachia brand was first used by Polívka in its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not a question of orienting him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later Harabiš came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Valachia.
From this comical origin resulted a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabiš then created the society Kingdom of Valachia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in passports and even offered his owners discounts to visitors to his farm and to attend his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also determined today that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on the stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valachia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project it was Harabiš and his team who were fully dedicated to it.
The collaboration, among today's decomposed parties, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment on, conflicts began between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the overthrow of the "king Boleslav I, the forever chosen".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš, was played by Jarmila Šulaková as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an indictment against Harabiš and his society, which has so far been rejected by the court.
Something in clear could bring into the dispute, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to reveal any more data or dates.
"We're in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr Polívka can present himself," added Harabiš.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: prejudices overcome
To tell you the truth, I've never liked Peugeot 206 very much.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is his successor, the Peugeot 207, on the market, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the headboard space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer in front of the two meters of length.
Flying around the world
I pass through the interior quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate more the design invention although the car already looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained of short seats and backrests.
Also unlike model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space, and here you can feel how the body measures have grown.
In the Combi disappears the mentioned shortage of space in the headboard.
Baggage in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is his trunk.
This should be valued as very accessible (thanks to the folding rear gate) and a well distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the same type of vehicle best sold in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mladá Boleslav's model, we find that the Peugeot lags behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when placing the baby's stroller its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I must quote the flat that remains quite flat after lowering the backrests of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, that's how it should look like a 1600 that despised the family member five doors.
It's quiet, it consumes little and above all, it has impulse.
If I compare it to the time of the then škoda that seemed as if the exhaust pipe was plugged by a rag, I can say that with this one I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 crowns, can still be.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only that we would still have airbag on the headboards, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper, automated rear windows...
I mean, the car with everything, it costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but count on the team complements at Fabia and you'll get a pretty similar number.
Now it is only left to decide by which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries attend, and locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans so far brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between emigrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is very well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where the conflicts between natives and Slovak migrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and anger among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense she said that the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
The police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak emigrant.
The girls hoarded him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to let it go, he made us the urge to throw apples and pears at us, and then he dropped his pants and showed us his ass," described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with emigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools is starting to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled, provided you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, large waves or a calm sea like a pond.
the palm trees and all enclosed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island does it find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
In the Spanish era, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called her, the most beautiful place human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and took to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The Hotel Nacional grew up in the late 1920s.
He had it built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminal in the US (and therefore forbidden) was welcome and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among its guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high buildings emerged, along wide avenues ran the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of the world of spectacle and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita Abánense you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the dear Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cult cars from the 1950s, until today, continue to operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat who arrived a long time ago have rusted between these humid and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating noticeably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surroundings as there.
Other places are metamorphose in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín province and in islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and that is highly valued by railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the huge plantations to the narrow-track sugar factories in steam or electric machines.
Their garages for decades have not been discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose brother models that exist in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And for that reason, it is no longer necessary to talk about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the already mentioned Hemingway estate there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not stop visiting it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation growing in limestone land.
Mogotes, limestone piles and rocks of high escarpment in the fall of the valley, and in their caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where tobacco of the highest quality is probably grown in Cuba.
By visiting some of the cigar factories you can find your final product.
Maybe someone seems interesting that there was the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman.
Trinidad
Old city of Abolengo that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who arrived later, in four centuries has hardly changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountain range of Escambray, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road to join it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore, neither, nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than one afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as the Playa de Ancón or the valley of sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which encourages with its music the silence of the mornings.
Barracks
Small town on the western end of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that view is already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that hardly knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (it is actually a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was and now there is a hotel with its same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patroness of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of Copper, the Santeria, an African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, could be filled with many pages.
However, as it is said, better to see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few troops and insufficient equipment are needed to influence the mission ' s progress in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Defense Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working as intended, representatives of the countries with troops in the southern part of the country coincided in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement are growing, today the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to increase their activity, Britain sees the strengthening of Afghan government authority and the sharing of development aid as a priority.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable, but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next one is to enable the population to start economic and security development alone," Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC station.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to U.S. Army data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to the last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have around 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which one quarter are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
They exactly ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
"I am not happy to know what we have on earth and in heaven in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and teams we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told Reuters at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries attending in recent months is the controversy as to whether all the allies are doing the utmost in Afghanistan.
Passive criticism, for example, of Germany.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the demands of struggle there are not as high as in ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun, this week called the German soldiers vague.
"Afghan rebels discover that Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troops played a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach billion in 2009
For each Czech the state owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt amounted to CKr 842.7 billion in September.
This year, the government planned to lend $159.2 billion.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the economy of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic increased at the end of September to CKr 842.7 billion.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, the number of crowns has decreased by 13.4 billion.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the debt of the early October state.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state has been indebted with more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year we could cross the border of the billion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 90 billion and the billion crowns," said iHNed.cz, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
The economist of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora, also sees this: "We could spend the billion in 2009.
Exactly when that depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the situation on the political scene changed and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But such a change I don't see," he added.
Doubt Grows
The state debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The state's debt is paid by means of treasury bonds, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the state grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
Foreign debt has so far grown from SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 123.3 billion.
The so-called debt of the negotiable state at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z kroner since June was reduced by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total annual debt from the first to the third quarter creates 13 percent which is enormous given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from obligations where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it is going to be negotiated until there is a pension reform" said Pikora.
Better than expected
From the state's payment strategy and debt management for 2007 it is extracted that the government planned this year to lend R$ 159.2 billion.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry decreased the plan by LKK 152.8 billion thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit of the state budget which this year will be 76 million kroner instead of the expected 91,300 million kroner.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech consolidation agency with some 13.3 billion kroons, the reserve of 10 billion kroons for the payment of pensions, 43 billion kroons to finance the state's bonds and 1.8 billion kroons in payments of the European Investment Bank's loans.
I was comparing it today in front of a court in Khartoum for giving a name to a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British was accused of letting students between the ages of 6 and 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
He was liable to a whipping penalty.
This 54-year-old British school teacher, based on the Khartoum Unity High School in Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with an attack on Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints by parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
" Eight names come out of the children's mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah, and Mohammed, " says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after one vote in class, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the bear's photo with the following legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One Muslim colleague from Gillian Gibbons, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I'm just sorry that he asked the children to vote for a name, " he says, it's just an "innocent mistake. "
Opinion divided by numerous schoolteachers who describe her as " very attentive to her students " and " who never speak of religion in class " .
Let us remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They did not reach agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach agreement on the statute, " said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not foresee violence for now but we enter a very difficult period, " he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist. "
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, regrouping the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated by 90% Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was entrusted with a new mediation by the UN last August.
The US and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on the pursuit of negotiations beyond that date.
" Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution, " said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, the Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," announced the president of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has expressed his regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to killings and deportations."
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic, for his part, considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Belgrade particularly fears a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
" For Serbia, " he said, "this does not mean that a commitment is impossible. "
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a veto right.
" The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word "
" Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, " said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be " in concert " with the Westerners.
Bush launches agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he convened on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common declaration.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to enter into immediate negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must put an end to its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides ' obligations to the peace route they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority presided over by Abbas would attempt " to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This name covers the three main complex problems of the disputed point between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American president, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "globalized and deepened" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things. "
On his way back to the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to what the forthcoming negotiations are "direct and continuous" and to making "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the end of the implementation of its co-existing " vision of two Palestinian and Israeli States " .
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made an effort in this regard on the part of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes to Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects, " says Prince Saud in his Arab periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the D.A., the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just as each time in this type of events, official versions and rumors oppose.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspectorate-General of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17 Luisa-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
" I was not in surgery but on patrol, and I was traveling at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating lighthouse, " explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, i.e. not authorized to travel on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was circulating " all gas " .
" He hit the police car on the left, after a failure to give way to the right, " the police said.
The control of alcoholemia applied to the occupants of the vehicle was found to be negative.
The state of the car (the groundless front, cracked windshields, torn bumpers) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the procurator of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " acts of involuntary homicide and denial of assistance " to the IGPN, coveted with the departmental director of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor specified that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stadium, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the version of the police officers, namely that this mini-cycle arrived relatively quickly to his left " .
Yesterday, a type of slot, no doubt caused by the rubbing of the socks on the floor, showed that both vehicles were stuck in time for the police car to stop.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the site very quickly, not thus providing help to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside " all serious faults " with regard to this point.
" It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more research, to be very careful about, " said a police source.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that precisely gives to the scene.
" We went down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them, " says this witness.
There was nothing to do. "
Then he saw " a completely terrified cop, who was limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the youths, the fourth speaking on the phone. "
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently with the certainty that people were present about the unexpected situation of young people, the police have been driven by car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
According to this witness, the aid arrived "about twenty minutes after the police march. "
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
" I will not assume that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been helped.
The firemen arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them, " stressed the procurator.
Voltage rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police suppressed on Monday the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement officials, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stone shots, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police carried and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president " exhorted the population to send flowers to the judges who pronounced against the state of emergency and the waste to those they swore before Musharraf".
" Musharraf's Promise Does Not Fulfill "
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly concerned with the measure of exception proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to rule in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been eliminated and replaced.
" Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court, " the judge told The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf ' s promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president " no longer valued " after the establishment of the state of emergency, he told the Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy chief of armies.
More than one-third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies are not expected, a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), 40 years after the Neuwirth law passed, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still show a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimated by Ined.
However, the liberalization of contraception allowed for a better "domain of fertility, " according to the institute that notes that the rate of pill use among women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated a little more or less a month for a couple in five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair of the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew of the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel and indispensable for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky output that accumulated the records due to its duration, its remoteness from habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "capuceados" by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had released the Harmony module from the Discovery launcher, a thick cylindrical piece responsible for soon hosting the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing platform for laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to supply them in electricity.
The crew's second task was to displace an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After displacing it, the crew began the reorganization of the solar panels of the module that have a width of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, has been damaged in a little bit more than a metre by a wire that got stuck.
The deployment has been stopped to stop damaging the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had a control exit from the Discovery launcher, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to caracolear at the end of the 30 meters of length of the remote-directed arm of the shuttle added to the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (spacewalker) in Nasa.
High, resistant, very skilled, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been in charge of "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After having precisely inspected the damage, he cut the fallible cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second " spacewalker " who had stayed near the air lock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped with insulator to prevent electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "capuceado" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his instruments and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a noon rest before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for the planned return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned in Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently falling sharply to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautical and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros to the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to review its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to " between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the mother house of the European builder EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the exploitation result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adds without any more encrypted precision.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS's operational outcome failed by 86 % in 2006, mainly due to charges linked to delays in another programme, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned for a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Choosing the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming his aspiration to stability, including authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending the voters today a televised message about the public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of predilection during the campaign.
" We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incidents, " he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign muddled by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that "there have never been such dirty elections, until the time of Yeltsin".
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, former world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, is banned from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the Soviet homo mentality"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful united Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, at both the legislative elections and the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
" The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo, they do not feel they own their destiny, " says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
Historian Nikolaï Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes back a long way: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putine restored the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic relief ", says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility " of those who had briefly proved themselves after the outbreak of the USSR.
" Why Reflect? "
The phenomenon touches all social strata, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians, they won't vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: " Why reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them? "
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored over 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not available to be consulted here only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of an ex-victim or his right-holders.
The eleven states in charge of its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to searchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, openness has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow searches " particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of the forced workers " , explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, such as Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the peasants deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, if necessary, to provide proof of their detention, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
" There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents, " said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade is now close to €60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
The European Union's Foreign Ministers gave their approval last April to the European Commission to start negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) to sign free trade agreements. Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the ninth largest trading partner in the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
" A free trade pact will do much to both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans, " explained Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants change annually for "47 billion euros of goods " and for "10 billion euros of services ", had declared this week Danièle Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential". The European Union and India are on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England takes note of concerns offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of £10 billion at the base index of 5.75 % in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
" In order to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight by the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the manner in which they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, " states a statement.
The bank requires that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on December 6th at 12:15 GMT, at the basic index and until January 10th.
It is the first time it seems that the Bank England BoE puts liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is " prepared to take further steps to maintain the indexes " of day-to-day interbank loans in line with its core index.
The interbank rate per day was 5.829 % on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6.6%, highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the pound's exchange against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more secure discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny the examination of the PS party's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
In a socialist "niche" (meeting for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national PS office, including the 50% increase in the employment premium, the restoration of the floating TIPP (internal charge for oil products), a transport check or rent restrictions.
Since UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was adjourned at the end of the general discussion which led to exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS deputy leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill discussed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
" For our company, it's an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more or less, the current festival movement in America, " entrusted Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival would take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
At another time known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizing of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as "more inspiring event" that he has never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
" We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with perseverance with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, " says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we stagnate in low-level policies because of the current administration, pursues Charlie Jones.
" Fortunately, we were able to argue with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional location that will recently take place in Philadelphia. "
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Chicago Grant Park, after demarcating in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
" Melvin Benn's European model is a country festival, while ours is done more in urban green areas, " says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give at the same time an impression of a rural festival in the European and urban way in the American way. "
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
" The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event, " says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states " that they are interesting enough to allow investment in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life. "
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer for this festival is "very big", like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been launched to the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going to press.
" Vineland will taste like rock, but music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers, " says Charlie Jones.
His C3 teammates, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film dishes to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of a delegate.
A warrant - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions. "
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
" Be careful, it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If you find the conditions in Montreal favorable, you'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best, " he says.
The race to festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The Oskar race has begun.
All festivals on the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, value them and make sure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is in billboard to Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be end-of-year rally in stock market? Experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks before the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that it will be produced.
Banif believes that "from the statistical point of view, December in stock exchange usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, even more so because, in the current context, uncertainties lurk on the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange taking a wheel in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the flight effect towards quality values both in the long and short stages".
For this reason, they believe that the bag will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decline of the Fed types is not known, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, responsible for sales of BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be rally.
"There is not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% since the peaks marked on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert notes that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes that the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the Constitution Bridge.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a rebound of the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for bringing the Ibex to new maximums.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year it is up to the great values".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, assures that the climbs will come from the hand of the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, should they occur.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC to follow their same path," explains the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be the main factor in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a low month.
The real year-end rally was held in 2003, a year in which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a rebound of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of winnings (at the moment the Ibex climbs by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds in counting its year-end rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
People have decided to renew much of their offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group to decide to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 in the afternoon, and open Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 in the afternoon.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to expand its branches' schedules, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of Popular's experience will be decisive for other entities to aim or not at this initiative that follows the schedule of trades.
This is precisely the goal popular pursues with the project.
Catch private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, autonomous and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling of existing ones.
To this end, the company will modernize its branches in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the hours is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more current design with brighter colors.
The commercial banker, Ángel Rivera, claims that this restructuring does not represent a big investment, although a greater recruitment of staff, since it is more than having about six employees per location to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these premises of PopularMax will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to compete with our customers," Rivero says.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco first doubles the stock exchange value of its rival Antena 3
We got it.
With that phrase yesterday he expressed his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the close of the market, when he found that the chain that runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect clouded his joy: 'it is what hurts me, it is not because we have grown more but because we have come down less', he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a 2.54% advance.
That gain puts their loss in what we have been doing for the year at 15.66%.
The stock exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday yielded 1.52% and accumulates a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Pisa (five-day publisher) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience'.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel this year to exceed the 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespana, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
If this announced figure became real, the television channel would record an increase of 3.6 per cent in its advertising billing over the 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antena 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net television revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution in the Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders, whom we have already valued with 33% of Endemol', happy.
According to analysts, the market is showing signs of some tiredness at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
It is explained that the projected income growth has been cut from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antena's profit forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecuritys: recommends buying both values based primarily on their high profitability per dividend and sustainable potential in the long term.
Two.
Caja Madrid: sees Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antena 3 (maintain) for the 'multiple attractions' and rise of the business.
Three.
JPMorgan: recommends underweight in both cases by having 'like threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary process, which ended today with Congress's vote on amendments to the bill in the Senate, the Government has put to public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of having both of them come into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation in order to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activities of the entities for the efficient functioning of the markets.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves modernising financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new legislation will enable financial advisory services to be provided to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (FIAs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are complemented by multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services companies to disclose on the market key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, in order to facilitate oversight by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Congressional Economics Commission, several amendments were incorporated, among which it is noted that the securitized debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given their high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what happened with the debt of high-risk US mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics and Business 30 years after the adoption in 1977 of the Royal Decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work for others, will not require authorization from the CNMV and will be able to provide its services of marketing products and attracting clients to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonised CPI increases five tenths in November, up to 4.1 per cent
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices in Spain developed during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to offer data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of its publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be released on 14 December.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and minister of economics, Pedro Solbes, has said that the rise of 4.1% of the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he has hoped that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" the inflation differential of Spain with respect to monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He has also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economy acknowledged regarding the data advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise €42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen more than 50% to £12 billion (EUR 16.8 billion) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time, it was collecting record deposits of over £25 billion, a figure that has gradually fallen in two and a half months due to the mistrust of its customers and despite the 100 per cent guarantee of that money offered by the Government and which it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the income from British banks that will be deposited in the next three years in order to achieve the remaining £18 billion until reaching the target of $30 billion.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for his striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend £50 million (about €70 million) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, as its preferred to rescue it from bankruptcy.
Arrested mayor of Totana for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today at the first hour of the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People's Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the Consistory and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then governor of the municipality, last May, and according to research sources consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
Officers continue to register municipal units and the Urbanism Council and no further arrests are dismissed in the next few hours.
In addition, counsel for Juan Morales, the main suspect in the plot of urban corruption uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the SER Chain reported yesterday, Juan Morales' lawyer, therefore, was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to lead PSOE's candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the
Former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the president of the government and secretary general of the socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of Congress in case the socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by PSOE's Secretary of Organization, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "it seems" that the mannego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over Congress if socialists win in the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who made public on November 15th his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his career in active politics to engage in the fight against climate change in the university arena.
The former minister has acknowledged that the President of the Government has been insisting on returning to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
He also pointed out that, as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in a "act of transparency".
If he succeeds in office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or cry" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk calmly and quietly is Congress, the president of the government was interrupted on one occasion in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good doing" and has not wanted to see himself already occupying his post so as not to fall into what he has pointed out, his adversaries could see as "prepotence".
Climate Propagation
Since the climate change movement is subject to unmerciful persecution by both the skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach obliges you to explain why your Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain's leading the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance, in which sectors it has occurred and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires you to explain with the utmost clarity to the Spaniards what measures you will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
I mean, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there hasn't been and there won't be any such explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the actual measures, are unpopular.
Cost, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the cent of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
That is, that it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not pretend that we move on a bicycle or cool off with the fan.
Arrested by the mayor and the head of the Totana local police for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the city council secretary and a hotel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, have today reported sources of the investigation.
The building was arrested at its home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose units it is currently located together with numerous agents, who have also gone to the City Council and the municipal company of management of the Industrial Floor and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rural land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 houses, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs the Court number 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have been brought before the courts today.
According to the sources, the former governor of Totana and now autonomous MP of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the former governor's current girlfriend, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of Grupo Nuaria, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Souelo de Immonuar, an agency integrated in the aforementioned Group, through which bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven registers, the majority in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was then arrested in Totana, specifically the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Totana municipality of Murcia, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would mean doubling the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the car parks in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico square; Hogartel, dedicated to the sector of direct marketing; It recommends, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.
Things That Happen

If it seems to you, let us rest on the Book of the Month, to see if in the meantime we can think of another ‘premiology' and other competences.
I'm already perging something.
Life is change, people.
Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.
Two.
Our Finnish correspondent gives us this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by the way at the head of the PISA report on the education level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of the book of Blackburn:
"The content of the signature of Philosophy has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes."

A colleague provides information on the introduction of Internet download offences into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal in the store disks worth less than EUR 400, it is simply considered missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros in the shop, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the one imposed on the unloading (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of the discharge (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
To participate in a tumultuous contest has a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than a DVD film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the authors ' permission is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Anyway, if my colleague's right, someone's getting out of hand, a very long hand.

My head doctor gives me one of his rare research articles entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
That is, that the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depends on what the colleagues earn.
The study has been carried out using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that if when both were right, the activation was moderate, but if one was twice as good, the activation was higher.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly persecuting Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter sweet taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, remain at large.
Their names are on that list of which takes their title the documentary of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The list of Carla' (2006, not released in Spain) who, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the escaped criminals and pressure the governments involved to narrow the siege.
How safe is it for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of possible accidents, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the card, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having the car is only the beginning.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is embodied in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being held liable for the obligation to pay damages in the event of a loss.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that in the most likely event of an accident, higher fees to be paid.
It is for this reason that both older than 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower rate of injury due to their prudence.
In addition, the companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of having some kind of perchance.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver has to study the situation well in order to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
Here we will show the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 have a number of disadvantages in hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and seniority of the card.
Although the ideal to be well insured is insurance at all risk, there are other more economical options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a whole risk with franchise, so that they get insurance coverage at all risk but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would mean that the client pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the damage that the customer contributes will be pre-set according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," specifies Luis Noguera, Spain's highest responsible First Europe insurance broker.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not to those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A piece of advice.
If you are under the age of 25 try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will impact on the bonus, and can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a discount on the basic fee that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that basic fee.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of it.
If the company has had a good year it can afford to increase the bonuses," explains Noguera.
After the 25-year-old age, drivers have it easier when they hire insurance, since the rate of injury is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is most advisable to hire a whole risk with franchise.
"Young people usually cannot make use of the experience they have previously gained when using an accident, and even when driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the rookie' has passed.
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is preferable for him to negotiate insurance at all risk, as long as his economic situation permits, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest rate of sinisterity, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at all risk with franchise (which could be 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchise," says Luis Noguera.
For retirees it is recommended to have an insurance at all risk with a franchise (this being 150 euros), or one to an extended third party when there is a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is essential to study properly the insurance that suits us best according to our personal situation.
The Celtic seeks in Milan a point worth the eighths
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that they lack to achieve their respective objectives in the closing of the 'Champions' liquilla, since the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to judge their classification.
The Italians add up to ten points and already certified on the fifth day their pass with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shahtar, with six, and that it receives the Benfica, which has four, does not advance it.
These two games of Group D will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, since Milan has to compete at the Club World Cup in Japan, where it debuts on the 13th in semifinals in search of a place for the end of the 16th.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would stay first and would ensure a better cross in eighths.
Gordon Strachan's whole could even serve a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't be trusted because at nine points the pass is for Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the milanists will try to bitter the Scots the night, who trust to get into the restructured Champions League for the second time and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round the last campaign with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the round.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who is only worth the triumph, in case he loses the Celtic, both to get in eighths and to continue in the UEFA.
And it is that the Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the maximum European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which the UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, with some 20,000 spectators since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "brilling".
Around 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to witness the concert that included a video telling the story of the group that made rage at the end of the 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that captures its main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went on stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd that crowded GM Place, even though Victoria's nerves had banned him days earlier.
In the run-up to the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British star "has not seen our locker room at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think about the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that over time, "things have been arranged and we all love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last played together in 1998.
First, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon their arrival at the airport, an army of nannies was waiting for them.
Of the five, there are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5-7).
In Madrid they will act on 23 December.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of Russia's exporting fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each spray between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopolistic gas owner Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it will charge Ukraine more, as it has committed to paying 50% extra in 2008 for gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that Ukraine could pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"Changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about transit rate levels [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut Ukraine's supply in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which quickly increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "must prove to foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to check the criminal record records of employees outside Europe, said one vigilante.
The recommendation of Auditor General Robert Black came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the number of foreign staff it has.
However, his report pointed out other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The Auditor General checked the number of foreign staff hired outside the European economic area, following attacks at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep crashed at the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey for video conference in October, charged with alleged car bomb attacks in the UK.
NHS hopes to carry out pre-employment checks for candidates, to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal record checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The Auditor General's report recommends, among other measures, that boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside of Britain.
"Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but points out that: "Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign staff."
The president of BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations is," he explained.
Scottish health authorities state that there are currently 1,161 foreigners, most of whom are doctors and nurses
But the Auditor General warned that the number may be higher, partly because boards have problems identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being carried out extensively.
This includes passport checks, work permits and qualifications checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide for foreigners in the NHS.
Health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was of great interest that this work should be carried out as a result of the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - what they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates the film awards
Control, the biographical film about Joy Division's late vocalist, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for the best film.
The trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress by thriller "Notes of a scandal".
And Bond's protagonist, Daniel Craig won the variety award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film, in black and white, featuring soundtracks by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was produced with only £3,000.
But he also won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic title of the album Joshua Tree of U2, awarded two awards- to best director and best debutante director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning ceremony - like Julien Temple's film about The Clash singer Joe Strummer, won the award for the best documentary.
Viggo Mortensen took the award to the best actor for his role as driver of a head of the Russian mob in London, in the film by David Cronenberg Promesas del Este.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hardball, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The 50th, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones "The Crystal Skull Kingdom".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named in honor of Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it's really an honor."
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 Terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell activists planning an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda supporters have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the TV report said.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the largest oil plant in the world, following a failed attack by Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Minister of the Interior, said that 18 of the detainees belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight shells into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in arresting Saudis travelling to Iraq to join Al-Qaeda as militants to fight against allied forces and to support the Muslim Shiita government, which is considered heretic by the more extreme Saudis.
Al-Qaeda activists are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been designated by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the pro-Western government of the country - had as their objectives residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy installations.
"This was a great effort of the security forces, since five months of work," the spokesman for the Minister of the Interior said to state television.
The arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 others accused of providing support and financial support to militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus could have once been a suitable place for life, scientists declared yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and the slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide an overview of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission states: "It is being clarified why the climate in Venus is so different from that of Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario where Venus began as the Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago."
Police decompose "enriched uranium"
One kilo of radioactive material, which they declare to be enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds sterling).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it's not worthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary and current voters record questions on video and send them for dissemination among the candidates.
None of the questions raised on the afternoon of Wednesday, November 28, were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey who asked the Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican YouTube party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party in front of next year's elections.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates for candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest one-item debate, focused on immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to go up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: issuers noticed peaks of approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest word exchanges of the night took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the issue.
No one has the right to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both alerted on the subject of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, together with fear of China's toxic toys and other foreign concerns, helps Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became awkward when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in Iowa's most recent survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to answer if Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is increasing in Iowa, coincidentally with the fundraising campaigns of Liberal Ron Paul, and his heated statements from Wednesday's debate.
They have both come out from the bottom, because the two sides of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labor pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but equally emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have sold influences, nor are they exorbitant accounts of hotels in Paris, nor do they suck off extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour government party of over £650,000 (1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister eluded calling an election, insulting British intelligence stupidly declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat leads with growing ingenuity, because the feared Mr Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr Bean.
Northern Rock's bailout, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment at times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the Lords' chamber, protesting against the courts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means Mr. Brown is irrevocably walking out.
Governments can reach a turning point after they are unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes control.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister cannot improve things, that he does not have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials start to fail; cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press seeks bad news; and the government puts itself on the defensive and does not focus.
On the one hand, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that it is new.
Although he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his superior lieutenant.
Northern Rock's problems and the authority registration tax are related to Brown's decisions as chancellor of the era.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blairish's setbacks - or "effective for partners", the investigation of the financing of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has he been conned directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with gifts of charity, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not made by him.
The anti-anonymity laws for major political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that it was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraiser who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these proceedings, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the work.
It has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but it is diluted in decision-making by a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter - conducted, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a matter of the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent leader for the Committee on Rules in Public Life, since he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for a genuine reform of party financing.
This will require hard cooperative labor with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the unions - bitter measures for a partyist like Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and strong competition.
Card sharks
The subprime mortgage crisis is infecting the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's natural for dorsal fins to swim excitedly around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes set on the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis contags other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion can be seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that are more than 30 days late, respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million in its business of financing the American consumer, partly due to the weakness of the card borrowers.
However, it's too early for panic.
Morosity and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, in the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American People's Bankruptcy Act (2005) resulted in a sharp fall in bankruptcy claims, which in turn represent a huge loss in credit cards; the number of claims (and therefore of lateness) would be growing again, or it may happen that the conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expireing.
But credit card issuers look more at liquidity flow than active securities, so falling prices do not necessarily trigger a change in borrowers' credit capacity.
They can even work to advantage the emitters.
Incentives for consumers to continue amortizing the mortgage decrease if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card's debt goes up in the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions of mortgage lenders, by changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
This in theory should reduce the risk of rapid asset retreading.
"We're not gonna wake up one day and reevaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Chief Financial Officer of Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a decline in credit pushes America into recession, the industry is undoubtedly facing a more severe future.
We need to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility for the frauds with Enron's former head of the financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven charges of fraud by colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing with Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. District, each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were for alerting Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron's fall.
The charge against the bankers - it doubled the "NatWest Tres" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his previous superior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, who was the creator of a myriad of frauds in Enron, which helped his spiral of bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary at zero, but the three British knew it would value upwards.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest in $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest on the company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its subsidiary parts.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers earned 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the prosecution.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two counts of conspiracy in Enron's collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million that they required to live in the United States while the trial was taking place.
Enron, one of the nation's seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their failed businesses look successful.
The collapse caused thousands of jobs to be lost, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay, and former executive chief Jeffrey Skilling were held in custody last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"It has capacity for up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
"But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it's for private family flights or for presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day orgy held in an event center in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract the new Russians to all kinds of products, from mahogany crafted yachts to diamond-encrusted car grilles worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche at the stand next to his."
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and boiler compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was at its peak.
"We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and spenders."
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their share of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires who make a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think thank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time alongside the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in evening costume, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," Yumatova said, who reeled off the design suit he was wearing as a carpet network will veto dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the kind of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a store that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum clippers, Mövenpick ice creams, tables for commissioned pools, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears from Gund.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of the real Dutch porcelain Delft, in front of a wall-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling.
In fact, the sellers said that the rich Russians of the most trajectory (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from the striking logos to the brands of limited editions, which would not be exposed at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people — cash millionaires, millionaires' emissaries or tourists — fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, Managing Director of King Koil Beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said that he had sold three chain-shaped car grilles, for Rolls Royce Phantom, at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with embedded rays of Swarovski colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
Cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, will not necessarily drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's gonna keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it's not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who weren't millionaires could at least pretend to be rich for the support of the Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red phone booths (British style) filled with one million dollar counterfeit piles.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobiles while resting on piles of money, or getting a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
"Chapuza" surgery could be cause of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the "A little healthier" restaurant and saw an ambulance climb up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the ambulance go up," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that day on Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, assistant to the head of the Newark police department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works in the home of 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities still do not determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but wait for the tox screen, although the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help solve the mysterious death that has plagued the top ranks of Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me."
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, and left two 14- and 11-year-old children, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, Spokesman for the County Union Prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said the house arrived near 3 P.M.
On November 21st, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was declared dead at the scene.
It has been more than a week and the authorities have said little about his investigation or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs Walsh could not say whether Mrs Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a withered rose is located at the front of the house, and a dalmatian thief at the back.
A blue drum labeled "vainillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - was at the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was an invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its harsh political culture.
"She would say, "you have to watch with this one or that one," she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
It's embarrassing."
The federal reserve is expected to cut the fees to raise the Stock Exchange
The shares jumped to both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market waited for the federal reserve to calm down the terms of credit by cutting interest rates, which were increased with the reassuring comments of the vice president of the US central bank.
The stock exchanges were loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second of Ben Bernanke, president of the reserve, declared that policy makers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued strain of financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets in the midst of growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence was "in part reversed by market improvement at the end of September and during October."
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into US markets and to make further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
Observations also helped calm Wall Street in the midst of bad news for the U.S. economy, such as sales of homes that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, which is equivalent to 4% of its total labour force, in an overall cost reduction to offset losses of its investments in US sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, to 13.289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of Britain's leading companies.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6%, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Earlier, the re-emergence of credit stress in the markets was highlighted after a strong demand in a three-month auction of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the federal reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the securities markets in London, strained credit and three-month "Libor" loan rates among the British banks, meant the rise since September, by 6.59%, after a steady rise since November 12.
England takes with judgment the claims of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is on loan- with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, director of England, is beginning to fill offers to become a national selector, and if not, on a part-time basis.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth bat place will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sports too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than capacity.
Not only in cricket is the choice difficult, because judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another way if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless they give him the chance to sink or swim at the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but so do they have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to capture the captain's eye at the same time as taking a "wicket" and a batter to get opportunities to change order if he wants to impact as a player someday.
But capturing the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who surely plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for "fit and bowls" as the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their moments high and can expect more of these.
The games of Shah or Bopara at the Asgiriya stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who came to become a major player, and despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, he may still be underrated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion in today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah's greater experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both of us.
In favour of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut test of early 88 in Bombay, 32 first-class hundreds versus only 6 Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent record against spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten races in his two shifts in May against West Indias in the test at Lords, his home as Middlesex player, and that caused immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, seemed to have taken some momentum from his "batting" that in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex's team has the joy of living in swords.
He sticks for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he turned his vehicle into an exhibition for England's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate looking away, to say with excitement, "Did you see that?".
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his moves that seem to satisfy him, as he beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not stand out, as suggested by the tea leaves, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who ran out of cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who led them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and what is safe now."
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he says, referring to the Shiite militia of religious activist Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to cease temporarily.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah phoned him to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped get Al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan's newcomers was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been led from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after he urged citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues."
"That's why I'm back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops strengthened groups of "concerned citizens", armed and working in cooperation with U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many declared that they had returned because of the denial of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had settled in recent years.
The 51-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai, father of three children, voiced the common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the visas of refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them back to Iraq," Sunni said.
"I can't believe a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will re-emerge sectarian tensions and start the struggle.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines through the international orientation of its high schools.
As in the whole country, the Sardinians lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for fifty-fifth time to a non-Sarlander that we are not French" - that was the ironic motorcycle on themselves from the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the education system of the Saar which in a study of the Institute of the German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" took fifth place.
In this way, higher schools by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The university of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from Saarland is higher than the average in higher schools, many of whom do not have a bacillate.
"The system of vocational education is being used in the Saarland," says Axel Plünnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute of the German Economy (IW).
More than five young people do their bachelor's degree at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Saar is 7 percentage points above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for a vocational-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by one third in recent years.
That was why the Ministry of Education of Sarre forced the higher schools to make more publicity for the specializations in Engineering Sciences.
"After PISA's first study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
For children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of the students has increased.
According to the PISA report of 2003, the number of backward students in school development decreased from 29 per cent to 20 per cent.
But, in general, the Saar did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
The PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages to the displeasure of the people of Sardinia, although it could produce good results in this area.
Although the Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject in the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chavez changes the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets the schedule change in the South American country by delaying the clock half an hour.
Chavez is currently becoming a comic in Spain.
As the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State has reported, according to the new law, the time will pass to at least four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision that the United States would in his day impose the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative Álvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is propelled by a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was about the liberation of the hostages.
On Sunday Chávez said criticizing that Uribe's decision has offended Venezuela.
There is also much talk in Spain about Chávez.
A new tone of call causes feeling in the country: "Why don't you shut up?", is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who felt upset by the continued interruptions by the left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a reduction in the real wage threatens German employees despite a strong conjuncture.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real wage account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The fault for this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the tightening of food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Cycles reported to the newspaper "Bild".
The new burdens of unemployment insurance may also be borne by employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% from one year to the next is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the work office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday, it was made public that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, prices are increasing by 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most like the Earth, something that had not been raised until now. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and whirls in the poles, the same ones that appear also in winter on Earth.
Already for three decades researchers had suspected that there could be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it has discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays run from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on Earth: the storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, for their part, gave rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
It's not like that in Venus: if there was life there someday, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface there are temperatures of 500°C, oscillating so that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Possibly, Venus is a "diabolic" twin on Earth, but he's still a twin," Russell said.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question why Venus, so similar to Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since there were no special missions since the 1990s, just for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many "Nature" articles, according to researchers, emphasize not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighboring planets have more common features with Earth than we had assumed," ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers discovered in the southern polar region also a vortex formed by clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon reminds us of the wind flows in the upper terrestrial atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost so large.
This planet also called dawn star or evening star orbits around the Sun almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus is equal to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars is not much like the Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets water had been agglomerated that remained on Earth in the oceans, but on Venus it dissociated in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, in Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end that fight for the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we must not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt".
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Part of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in terms of foreign policy, underlines the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach he received in carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional course of One China politics.
China knows that too," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his displeasure at the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), Germany's Minister of Finance, but also, according to information sources from the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Head of Government, demanded Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept that European politicians would receive the Tibetan religious leader in their official position.
Dalai Lama's actions and words demonstrated that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeus warns that there will be riots like those in France.
Battles with police on the streets, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeus warns that riots will occur as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move to the streets.
They were barricaded, the vandals shot the police with rifles: after serious riots by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeus (Part of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We also have to make sure that our country's social problems do not take the violent form."
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hannover.
Not all young people are involved in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, the federal states and the municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeus said.
This refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islam Conference: all this is already bearing fruit."
It's still early to take the end of the alarm for granted.
At the same time Schaeus indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same edifying and sociological problems as is the case in France.
The young people led serious riots in the streets with the police north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany, called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the unrest in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
In spite of everything, the actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above the average.
There must be more vocational training posts.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
It is necessary to "give young people the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training more quickly".
Meanwhile the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen took part in the action, a helicopter with headlights overflew the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burnt cars.
Since the previous day, a team of almost 1,000 police officers has been working on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that the police will take rigorous action until necessary.
On Monday night, about 80 policemen were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Toulouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of young people was not the fault of the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The action far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its last point and that nothing more should be expected of it.
But what country does the Chancellor really live in?
After her desperate, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House, one must say: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As for the reproach he was made for having repeatedly devoted himself to foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected him with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that that would be a provincial way and thus showed that he does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House it was made very clear to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
We could not feel a slightest interest in, or any kind of feeling for, the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs away from foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: the prevention of climate change: she praised herself very much for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but she says nothing about how these goals should be achieved here on climate issues.
In general, this way of praising oneself - for two years the head of the Party of the Christian Democratic Union has not been able to afford so much modesty.
Well, he's working on expressions to get a boost to people.
And in this way it damages his public image by the pragmatic conception with which he solves the problems without going by the branches.
But in Angela Wolke's kingdom the inner problems are appearances of little value.
Children's poverty and concerns about low-wage workers?
All he does is talk about it using subordinate prayers.
It's amazing how many times you're wrong to talk when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good phrase.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate of YouTube Republican presidential pre-candidates and now they must fear only one candidate from the outside.
From the outset, tensions have been noted among the candidates.
Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for having turned New York into "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants."
He, for his part, responded with serious reproach: "I would like to say that his own house was a "port" for the illegals." Giuliani answers the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as so far the Republican group does not have a clear favorite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the CNN debate, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small videos of 30 seconds, shot by internet users who were sent to Youtube, also have not much content.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power," that was John McCain's reproach to his opponent Ron Paul, the only one from the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing the troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives a lot of criticism from Vietnam's war veterans when he refuses to recognize "Waterboarding, " a method of interrogation, as he lets a person drown, as a result of his death.
Public reactions in the hall in St. Petersburg in Florida show that in the meantime the most important issues of the campaign are others, not only the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised conservative values and denied the rise in taxes.
So you can see better where are the weaknesses of both favorites.
"At that time I was wrong," Romney explains, compounded and asks for forgiveness from the people and the television audience for having been an advocate for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf ruled without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
That's how the eight years of military rule in Pakistan end.
On Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcasted the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his mandate as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he took power with an incredulous military coup, the former general ruled the state for the first time as civilian chief.
With his resignation from the post of Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf met the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the oath Musharraf will cancel the state of emergency very soon and will meet the second condition of the west.
Since it was proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there were many lawyers who supported Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all appeals before the controversial new elections of the head of government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Wattarian region, five soldiers died and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s continues its activity: three members of "Harmony" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release, a copy of "Live 1974" was made that was written in the band's best era.
Already in those times they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of him his box, his cables and above all his buttons.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with its sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother you gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's fans was the fact that the band Harmony made music again.
What needs to be rebelled here is the following: the questions precisely have shown that the name of the band was resounding in people's minds, but it was not so special that after 32 years the public missed it so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the misunderstanding Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to members of the Can 2003 band from Cologne for their work of life, in the room the surprised faces of German pop artists could be seen.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouths with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remind this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times it did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job in Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the Neu band! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that in those days was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th century ruin, they lived as city refugees.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more of an artist's life full of surprises.
According to them, one day an Ottenstein Harmony Association Flag appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmony.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second album "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just to get to know yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that, in this recording, almost 50 people participated.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do from time to time trials.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up in Esotericism and secured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and since that time has been more successful than Harmony had.
The live recording of the album at Griessmer, that's thanks to Groenemeyer.
His Grienland music company set itself the goal of cultivating this own German contribution to preserve it as live music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the band Neu! was again discovered.
Harmony's presentation as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized by public measures of the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all influences of Krautrock to the following pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, to it belongs the future."
There are photos where Harmony shows up with producers on a farm.
The story of the development of the legend is shown in black and white photo projections, where you can see instruments with cables.
In the background there are three veterans who began to improvise again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and battery so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects apparatuses that they had built with their own hands.
Currently electronic music is as it had to be.
Three people who delve into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere she coughs, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis she sings "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was already a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia keeps calm.
On the stage you reflect very well on what is already evident.
Where does it start and where does the music end?
That can break one's nerves or give you quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere just lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again devoted to war in the Balkans.
But the two of them weren't very convinced.
Either the concepts look a lot at actions and shootings or the two movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the Balkan mountain, but right there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, actor Richard Gere was again discovered.
We had finally lost sight of the prettiest man of the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and unimportant roles in women's movies and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important argument to watch perhaps the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do movie titles have to be so long and crazy nowadays?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: in the background, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life have passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his decadence preserved so far most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, turns out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
You can narrate the film "Moerderischer Frieden" in a nutshell: it is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the snipers in Kosovo, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and the shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm Fuer Cobra 11" without motorway, but in a state of war.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" one can investigate, because in reality there was never a good film about the war in the Balkans.
Another time, with another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard on two counts), the story about American war reporters going to detect a war criminal Serb called "Zorro", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and each time it turns out to be a journey in madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first they introduce us to Simon Hunt, whom they do not let be simply a cynic with heart.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Muslim Bosnia that they are going to kill later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the world's headhunters could not achieve for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to get revenge in a just way.
It's so bad, they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against kinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in reality, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really worried about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to mind a very famous Brecht poem.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem lies not only in the genre of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always worth a rule: when a star enters a region of crisis or the minefields, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts took place in a short space of time.
They have to go through at least decades until Hollywood makes a good holocaust film with the film "Schindler's List" as an example.
Some films already need more time. Classics such as Vietnam War Works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because screenwriters don't have the slightest repair (which is necessary to be able) in narrating good stories.
"Being or not" or "The Great Dictator" turned out to be so good at the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don't have to be a good person to shoot a movie.
Maybe you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant gaze of an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Diccionario de Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That is only because some things never change."
Large cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly murdered and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives negative criticism of the Olympic Games as a response.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economy for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that it is necessary to be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director General of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, expressed this resignation on Wednesday as "not good for the economic site".
In the last few days, no other project in the big city promoted as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal, the political, sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded that the Senate not forget this project, but find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statement that Hamburg's ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics were not to be achieved until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but it is decided by the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust says at WELT ONLINE.
It referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund), which is expected in early December, on Munich's application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought to have until 2028, from the realistic point of view we will have no chance."
"In spite of everything, this dream did not end forever," von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to let go of the opportunity, if the plans are ruined right now," said HSB director Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is contradictory to the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Federation of Sports of Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for 2015 Universities not as a "substitution" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week did the Federation of Sports Colleges appoint Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The fraction of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgersschaftsfraktion) blamed the senate for not taking advantage of the valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate was slowing down the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required an integrated planning of Olimpia for the little Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's request for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Who relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, think of Ikea, but don't think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Shine-Box of "type" in this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" cast doubt on the authenticity of the 1968 Brillo-Boxes by Andy Warhol, the Museum Moderna Museet of Stockholm carried out internal research and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Museum Pontus Hullén gave to the Museum Moderna Museet, are false, and almost a hundred of the others of "Stockocks type", which are in circulation in the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted the wooden boxes of red, blue and white, with the same sample that had cardboards of soap powder "Brillo".
According to Warhol, at the exhibition of his works in 1968 at the Museum Moderna Museet hundreds of Brick-cardboard boxes were exhibited. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the cardboard factory of "Brillo".
It was not works of art, but exemplars (which were only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol made it possible to produce in Sweden a Shine-boxes of wood, but they were not exhibited at the Museum Modern Museet.
Witnesses of those times now speak of nearly fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "Stockholm type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost one hundred wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
Warhol had been dead for three years now.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Museum Moderna Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they were printed and crushed their tight silver and then painted them in oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the pressed silver. Moreover, it is not about oil painting, but about acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol's official Bright Boxing List," says Lars Nittve, director of the Museum Moderna Museet and adds that if the Authentication Commission "Andy Warhol Art" in New York will not come to any conclusion, the Museum Moderna Museet will classify these six boxes as the copies/objects of exhibition."
Already in July The Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" in which they are soap dust boxes.
But from that moment everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers had surrendered to a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that she could not answer for spilling blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been squatting in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had a trial on Thursday for trying a coup d'état in 2003 that ended in a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so he could suddenly deposit with about 30 sympathizers.
Obviously, the military police who were supposed to monitor him had passed into their ranks and followed their mutiny.
They entered the "Península" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood in the vicinity of the Noble Hotel.
The president called for an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Adviser, condemned the behaviour of the soldiers.
"People are sick of it," Trillanes said.
"We summon people to come to our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The great critics of government called on Thursday for a great demonstration against the president.
For months, his government has been accused of corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all attention to the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts at coups against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder in Versatel.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the Versatel telecommunications company.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price for a share is 14, 46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company's absorption.
There are also options to further increase the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German market of DSL (digital subscription line).
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entry into the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its participation to the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market this means that the financial institution maintains the securities of participation for a third party partner.
United Internet already the day before involved with almost 10 percent of the company of telecommunications Drillisch.
Drillisch in the measure of capital expansion placed 17,4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106,4 million euros.
United Internet has bought from them 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, companies began negotiations on DSL-products marketing cooperation.
"We strengthen our collaboration," said United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies founded an MSP joint venture to acquire the Freenet competitor.
On Thursday United Internet reported that at first, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right, i.e. 18.49 percent stake in Freenet.
That meant that both companies maintained all options, especially participation in the Freenet public limited company.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
By the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now United Internet and Drillisch's holding had directly 6.01 percent of Freenet's stake.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
