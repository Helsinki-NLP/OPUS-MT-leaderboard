What's the story? ČSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or the pastry shop
The new ČSSD councillors in the capital are reportedly going to have to overcome the obvious language barriers in order for the members of the Prague Board and the City Council to understand their renewed colleagues in the SDG.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary that used Prague's political flower and cream during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the best-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors almost do not understand these well-known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is, I don't know."
"I'm more of a novice in Prague politics," said Lukáš Kaucký, a culture councillor, during the "collegeo" terminology exam.
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, Karel Březina reacted as well.
Maybe they know the concept of golf today.
"Perhaps it's the only expression of all you've asked me what I use from time to time."
"If not, I usually don't use slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions published the Aktuálně.cz newspaper last June before the SDG voting congress, the wording selected six examples, in particular those that are particularly related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
Socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "larger golf hole of Prague", "go to the pastry shop", "nucky bull", "treasure of the capital" and "bridging".
Three councillors agreed to take the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolinek, refused directly to do so.
"I don't get involved in these things, and I don't think I'm going to appreciate how the democrats enjoy themselves."
"What I do care about is how we will understand each other in the implementation of our programs," he said.
As has been seen, councilman Lukáš Kaucký allegedly did not realize that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former mayor Bem, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" does not say anything; the only term that was correct in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, who immediately adds: "But I know more about the news."
"I'm going to have to aim for a language course," he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also Environment Councillor Lukáš Plachý.
Later, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý really are, even knows where to find that character; moreover, he suspects the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; it soon reveals to Plachý that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janoušek.
Like Březina, he indicates that such knowledge obtained from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among the socio-democrats.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really seems like we have nothing like it."
"Moreover, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or we play word games with names," says ČSSD President Petr Hulinský, whose party mates call Hulda.
"At school I was called Bříza, but I don't know if my classmates also call me that," confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper tested the name and works.
For his partymates, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they were associated before the election deceptions during the party's sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igráček" ("playmobil") from some of his teammates.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulinský doesn't like to be called Hulda, but the Aktuálně.cz newspaper even discovered other nicknames for this president.
"The Doctor of the Rights of Scum" apparently recalls that Petr Hulinský obtained his PhD in Law at the Bratislava police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", as published in a brochure
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They tend to be of old age, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "return" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men rarely suffer such an ordeal."
"It also does not isolate healthy young women, because they help in the work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of the state of West Africa Burkina Faso, is working in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information leaflet that should help prevent witch hunting.
However, this has a stick.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the newspaper Die Standard warns about the disadvantages of written awareness.
The allegations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week, when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a wretched cluster of circumstances.
According to his version, the woman was stuck in the oil that is used for ritual anointings.
He set himself on fire when the group wanted to "expulsion the evil spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of the "witches" supports it people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "Human soul eaters have always been a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government was trying to appease witch-hunting, in the Gambia last year the President had still participated.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a wide hunt for witches who, supposedly, had been related to his death and had tried to kill the president himself by black magic."
"To help him, he brought in shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the personal escort of the president, were forcibly taken men and women randomly chosen from the Gambian peoples to the property of the president in Kanilai," says Amnesty International in his report.
On the farm, the arrested persons had to drink a pocima of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive their stay at the farm.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand people in detention.
Bakala's tenant: warms up with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The man, old and old, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal magnate" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he was carrying documents with the new three-story rental contracts: his, his daughter's and his son's, who is serving the sentence.
The three of them just caught the rental liberalization.
Instead of 3,500 Czech kroner per month, the child will pay from next year 4,100 kroner for a two-room apartment with separate second category kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler", shows the man with his finger in his son's new contract, over whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," he explains, half angry, half resigned.
BytyOKD.cz civil association, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, when they will publish a guide informing how to proceed in these cases.
But in the face of this, the man only makes a stick.
"Everything says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory of tests of liberalization.
After New Year's Eve it will happen with the vast majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
That is why Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
RPG's mining waiting room is one of the four of Ostrava's and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to take number.
"Rental 2011", can be read on a bright button on your touch screen.
When you press it, a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
Almost no time to read "157" and already the number appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an elderly marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, like in the past: settlement requests, insurance issues, and similar issues.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the boxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters a rent increase of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18 a special window is opened in the customer service center for new rentals.
"It's been running for a week, so it's starting," the workers who are in it when the client presents themselves as a journalist respond, after briefly doubting.
Liberalization and the former Bakala mining floors are the most delicate issues in the area.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament, from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek of ČSSD, treated them loud and clear, and now appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
"I didn't even get changed by the goddamn bathroom," the man mentioned in the introduction unburdens himself.
According to the workers, for the moment they come more than just retired to check if they receive a rent discount if they sign on time, as the special offer of RPG promises.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before 15 December will also receive half of the rent discount for February.
However, the window of the mining "liberalization" certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about the rent in 2011 about forty or fifty people," estimates the window employee.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach agreement on the rent, an independent judge will have to resolve the matter.
"It's not a threat, it's information about the only way to proceed in accordance with the law," RPG warns on his pages.
"No one is going to be judged here," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man on the street in front of the customer service centre gives her, at least in part, the reason.
"I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for the food; I have no means to go to court," he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see about that."
"Mr. Zaoralek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait," he says.
Rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"Current rents still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of the RPG Byty company, who adds that the careless state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for the owners, the main reason to increase the rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in four billion apartments with rents, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014, the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that stand out in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG's properties."
"In addition, it will always be no more than 7.50 Czech crowns per square metre per month", it is indicated on the screen.
Just increase by 38% the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 crowns per square metre," says RPG.
On 2,600 floors, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not suddenly affect rents, but will climb between four and eight years.
In addition, he adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent rise (see the chart) back on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the rent-up agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need day care
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would say that he also hides inside a small nursery with all the same to such installations: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outside terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch.Design's employees can come to her.
Arch.Design architectural project company, from whose studio numerous known buildings came out of Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-guard.
Around 90 people work in the company, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after motherhood.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, day care is one of the benefits Arch.Design offers to its workers as part of its social program.
Builders and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of their children.
The mini-guard was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-guard is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (a budget of over CZK 2.8 million) they were able to buy the equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified personnel and services.
When it exhausts the financing (two years), Arch.Design has an obligation to keep the miniguardry running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and in the submission of the application for funding contributed the company Economy Rating.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified staff, and a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care; the day-care centre currently accommodates children with no age limit, although most of them are under three years of age.
Since it is a "ministry", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible in order to adapt to the needs of the parents and the children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the enterprise.
Although it is an individual education and care, the contents of the mini-custodial programme are comparable to the regular preschool programme.
In it children not only play, but also receive quality education: from basic learning to preparation for school, they teach to English.
The class has not only toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up school children late when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is placed among the companies they sign that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened staff marketing.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Observe Gaudí's interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its shape similar to a skeleton, the locals nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the innovative use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade that recalls the scales and the ubiquitous gently curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, there is a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought out order.
At night, the whole facade of the house seems even more impressive, since it is illuminated so that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Snake and torsion of forms continues to surprise us also inside.
The corrugated wood copies the frames of the windows, the railings, the ornaments of the doors, the mirrors and the signs.
Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gracia, arose from the remodeling of a house in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Casa Batlló, made up of several apartments, did not design it alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in his plans of the project came ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the facade.
In the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Casa Milá and Gaudí's Güell Park, where other pieces of the same are found.
Due to its organic form, the locals soon after its completion nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific opening mechanism of the windows, began to call it "the house of the yawns".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Its inclination of forty-five degrees may be odd.
During the construction, Gaudí did not comply at all with the current construction rules and was not allowed to be influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although clearly in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city council was so impacted by the result it asked for to be corrected.
He was disturbed, for example, by the fact that the construction included columns even up to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather on the contrary: just fifteen days after the city council's request, Josep Batlló applied for (and obtained) permission to rent the two upper floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery on the second floor there was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented from a jewelry store.
The six-story house is completely crossed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted in breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the lounges and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, gained not only a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and skylights.
The game with the two colors brings the maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that the white reflects more light than the dark colors, which instead absorb the sun's rays.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and recharged apartment of those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and expanded the visits to the common area and the buhardilla, including the roof terrace.
The price of admission to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and tour card holders get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entry of other Gaudí constructions into the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly become friends with some resident of nearby houses and visit him at home.
How to choose mattress and mattress: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really confers its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the sommer.
First of all, they must be complemented to perfection so that they can be adapted to specific users.
During the election numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, state of health and sex of the owner.
It is also important the type of interior in which the mattress and the sommer are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they are "heated" more slowly.
In addition, they often weigh considerably more than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the central canals are not properly aired and above, they are on a firm basis, they keep moisture inside. Moisture can even appear below.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence it.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower and hard surface.
"Almost every hockey player who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep as well here."
"For his bruised shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a soft viscoelastic layer."
"This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes that time nervous system problems, so they get poorly information from joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You don't have to be an NHL player anymore to appreciate viscoelastica.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimizes your stiffness and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn like after a hard match.
She just sleeps better.
Viscoelastics also works as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of its feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example single rooms, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate width: when lying face up, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk towards your elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert at Cechu čalouníků a dekoratérů, who has been working on the problem of healthy sleep and furniture ergonomics for many years, a subject taught in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, each one needs its own mattress and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the sommers at different heights, which is not always possible on all beds.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with inside springs a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softness.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you sit on the mattress, you should definitely not notice the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a specific type of mattress.
The fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and the base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can't wash your case, which today is often done.
And since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will start to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even of a lifetime guarantee.
However, everything has a but.
For this reason, sellers give advice: in mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully take care of the cleaning and washing of the case, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although zippered mattress covers are currently made throughout its perimeter, so when you open them in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), handling them in larger models (and for one person only) when lifting the mattress may seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a sock, do you have a firm board?
Never!
At least a lot for the beds designed to spend one night visiting.
However, it should make (if you don't already have them) ventilation holes on the table and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-jointable sheet sommers containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fibre) may be used, although it is always better to have a sommer with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar zone are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated.
Articulated sheet sommers should not be used with a spring mattress, as they do not react to reclination.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the blades, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special fastening of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "wrap" perfectly to your shoulders during sleep.
For men with very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
Even the manufacturers of mattresses who, in the "male", began to use a softer area just around the shoulders remember them.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are somieres with cross structure or boards with so-called multitorsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
It should also be borne in mind that, even if you use the appropriate mattress and mattress, if you use a bad pillow (large and "mullid"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles can be relaxed.
The appropriate size recommended is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the sock with shoulder reinforcement or the softer area of the mattress) as the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to do with, it seems, the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, increasingly, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, which produce polyurethane foam, are filled with natural oils, e.g. castor or soy.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also choose the microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with brise vegetable extracts, so that the mattress bottom absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "heat" the bottom.
The red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel warmer.
The favourites today?
The mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various rigidities of cold foam and viscoelastic allows to manufacture mattresses of various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have lower VAT, since they are considered as health means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is complicated to save on mattresses and sommers.
Sometimes you can approve the offers of manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory foam Memory attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second one is obtained free of charge.
The era of viscoelastics with an open cell structure and a high density began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
It initially emerged as a material for NASA, because during the take-off the astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and adapts its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal to prevent sores, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is used not only in mattresses, but also for sanitary devices, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and similar.
More and more parents use tracking devices to control their children
Fear of children increasingly leads more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device is about the size of a matchbox, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were afraid of the case of the missing Anička and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the expense of invading your privacy.
"We're all trying to tell ourselves that it's not about spying, but about another way to reduce the chances of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are put in someone's bag without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In their view, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns that if the child does not want to take him, he will simply throw him away.
"Even younger children show great creativity in intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled."
"Parents used to rely heavily on mobile phones, but they could be switched off as easily as the tracking device," says Bočková.
In his view, it was questionable whether such a device was really useful in the event of an attack.
"If it is a prepared kidnapping, the author will almost always check whether the child has any electronic device that can reveal his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices is extended, it will also look for them, since their sale will undoubtedly be carried out with a lot of publicity."
"In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack by a paedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is destroyed immediately, its presence can help.
"You can configure the device to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If you suffer damage, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"The most expensive devices include a tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and stays motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Čech.
In your opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smart phones with navigation, in which only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that for the time being they are devices with a size similar to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
So they can get lost.
According to Macro Weil's Pilin, for this reason tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a possible attacker may not identify the device."
"Or identify him after some time, which can make the police buy time," he adds.
Although the tracking devices are carried on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the verification of the position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks to surround the whole of Chechnya, but it only lasts two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to hold explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometers of wick to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the wick's useful life is two years, four at most.
The army bought the explosive wick from the STV Group, a.s. for forty million kroner.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of wick by saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometers of wick a year.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnicians, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is decided, however, that, in such a case, they should perform such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high-ranking officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want to exempt the Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondr and the captain of the Vlastimil Picek army.
Only then could it be justified for the army to spend sixty kilometres of wick.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if so, the army would have enough stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the Rapid Intervention Brigade complained to Minister Vondra recently because they say they have little ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices for money are limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also fail to understand that they repeatedly buy us such quantities of wick."
"But it's your decision, and they'll certainly know why they're acting like this."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom, as a company, we try to satisfy," admits STV Group's commercial director, Jan Děcký.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometers of wick by also saying that he will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký, of STV Group, indicates that the wick only has a useful life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, of two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to the possible criticisms of the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of their useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that by buying 445 kilometers of wick, he got a discount.
"They cost us 60% less than last year's order of 244 kilometers," says the spokesman Pejšek of the Ministry of Defence's shopping centre.
Just to compare: the annual wick consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate World War II ammunition or left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 metres for years.
In addition, the police always ask only the fair amount to exhaust the ammunition before its useful life runs out.
They decided it for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and, in the meantime, they can get more modern and reliable wick types.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in finishing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition at the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people were preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years there will be the following problem with the current one: you will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old wick, which is now being bought "barata".
So far I'm still living off the contacts I got from the contest.
Winning the "Empressor of the Year" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun sell his hotel franchises.
The last edition won the contest "Empresario of the Year" 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun de Liberec.
His success story seems to be taken from a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he brought together with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank credit bought a house that was half-destroyed composed of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year at university, he was really brave.
"At present, the value for money ratio of the accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He started renting the first rebuilt floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned invested them back in the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he gradually managed to open in Liberec four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," said the number one businessman last year.
"This sale of hotel opening licenses greatly helped win the 'Empresario of the Year' competition," adds grateful Pytloun.
Victory increased its fame and popularity both in and around Liberec.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It certainly recommends to everyone that they want to try some company that participates in the contest.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live from contacts and acquaintances that, without the competition, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I started to collaborate regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
In total, about seventy.
"I have seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition."
"It is not, much less, my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of the whole team."
"It is only my name that appears in the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we've had at Farmet.
The euphoria for victory soon dispelled by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already passed the worst.
The owner of the Farmet company, Karel Žůárský, received the first prize in the last edition of Vodafone's competition "Company of the Year", last year in the "Slava House" in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition," says last year's winner.
Farmet's story begins with a desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to the father of Karel Žůárský the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the embargo of properties during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position in the company in which she worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialized public after reaching success in the media competition.
"Not only did our customers start to consider the Farmet brand to be considerably better, but foreign partners also started to appreciate the collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Žůárský.
Last year maybe it wasn't just a show of the euphoria of victory at Farmet.
It also gained recognition for trade performance until 2008 and, in part, in 2009.
And just 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, of course, do not get rid of such a situation either."
"The revenues were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs," explains Karel Žůárský.
A viable enterprise must sometimes even adopt unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company's profits, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
Nevertheless, where Farmet did not cut costs was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened the presence in the international market and obtained magnificent evaluations at national fairs," says Ž Ž árský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with it, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement hopes that it will bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žůárský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous rules
The Absurdez survey of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
You've already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which officials can access online.
The decision was adopted by more than a third of almost 4,000 voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the business register, although its officials could obtain it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extract from the business register when it carries out a check on the taxes of the insured person," said ČSSZ spokesman Jana Buraňová.
The objective of the Absurdez survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations that businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year it forms for the fourth time part of the business tournament of the Hospodářské noviny publication and begins to create hobby also among the general public.
While last year's edition counted with the participation of three thousand voters, this year it reached almost four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have a number of legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in number of papers needed for tax reporting we are in the world's first place," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic is in position 74a, i.e. eight positions worse than last year.
The Absurdez contest of the year was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the competition is closed.
Proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. The contest organiser then selects seven candidates for the "anti-premium" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet via www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Wins the absurdity that receives the most votes.
For this year's survey, more than one hundred were presented, including 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples were sent by both employers, professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and motorways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
This year's list of seventy proposals is posted on the competition pages.
The announcement of the contest, which is always held at the beginning of November in the Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world often participate.
This year, for example, this event was attended by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the state is constantly obstructing entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate a minimum of thirty paragraphs every year that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in drunkard water.
In 2007, what was most disturbing to people was the employer's obligation to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a post to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended in second place in the number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the work office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third one is over.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the contest of Hospodářské noviny is the category called Company responsible for the year 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way we want to support companies that are involved in the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel competition of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of Vodafone Empresa's 2010 main competition, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between them, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, they are for example disabled persons, in other cases personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists throughout the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main funder for sponsoring disabled children for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a stationery that is particularly concerned with the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the staff; for this reason it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of Chequia and in the contest Vodafone Company of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc he won the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administration activities will have the least possible impact on the environment," explains businesswoman Miluše Ryznarová.
The head IT Enlogit company in the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Person in Trouble grant, which specifically helps the local Roma community," said the company representative Ondřej Suchý.
The Praní to čištění laundry company in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that have an impact on their pension funds, is also well placed.
"We give benefits in food, transport, improvement of qualifications and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, of the construction company of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company contest of the year were automatically appointed who answered the questions of the registration form and sent it before August 15 to the organizers.
The organizers removed from the evaluation the forms that were not complete or incorrect.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the contest of Company responsible for the year, but are not disqualified from the contest "principal" Vodafone Company of the year."
"The individual candidatures for this competition are not allowed, since it is a subcategory of the main Company contest of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose consultancy.
Police made arrests during a public auction in the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The Anti-Corruption Police carried out several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It seems that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the land under cover is received by a specific interested party.
He had to pay for it to Luboš G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public bidding," Právo said to the chief of the Attorney General of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the moment he cannot divulge any more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
The way it was able to influence the public auction, given the lack of official information, can only be speculated.
The spokesperson for the Lubomira Černá Agricultural Fund responded to Právo's questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen's headquarters and went during a public auction.
"It's a customer, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Convocation for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the Land Law" and is held when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, offer a value higher than that of their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"On the basis of the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person who offers the largest offer," the Fund spokesman explained.
Luboš G. had information on who was to submit to the call and, since he was both interested because he had acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to interested parties on the ground that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain why, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on him.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund some planned land for the construction of public infrastructure, particularly in the place where a large road should be built to the industrial area of Borská pole.
Then, he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the city's own historic center with much higher value.
In this case, the city council had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would avoid construction.
Families will have to pay an additional cost of several hundred crowns a month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rentals.
As a result, families will have to remove several hundred crowns a month more than now from the portfolio, starting in January.
Electricity prices rise by 4.6 per cent, gas by about 2 per cent, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10 per cent more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should rise to about 100 crowns a year more than now.
However, major electricity suppliers reduced prices, as support for renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaics, has increased.
However, the gas is moderately expensive, especially at the time when heating is most used and, therefore, the higher the consumption.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are expensive throughout the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay from January for central heating an additional 50 kroner a month, while Liberec families will pay more than 1,000 additional kroner a year.
Residents in Prague will also have to bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, the Praguens will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will be increased by 7.4%.
They can significantly increase rental prices by 450,000 rented flats in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 floors in Ústí nad Labem, will increase rent from January to 100%.
The company will bring to the courts those who disagree with the new rental.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of about 300,000 floors, could increase next year to 10%.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in shape, because it has a slow effect.
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who find themselves with such cases at the hospital's pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes them a long time to get drunk."
"Fashion is now strong alcoholic beverages," says Právo, head of pediatrics at Hořovice Hospital in the center of Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they get a bottle of ice cream from their father, it can be whisky, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage that it is lightened with juice and that it doesn't smell that much," he explains.
The spokesperson for the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová, also confirms this.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, especially among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use aperitif that they caught at home," Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikán, 13- and 14-year-old drinkers usually appear in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times."
"It started at the age of twelve when she was brought in with 3.5 alcohol in her blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," says the department's doctor on this case.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother was not surprised that his daughter disappeared 48 hours," the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of the parents or even their clear tolerance for drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, one cannot speak of dependence itself.
"Alcohol means a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who repeatedly drink alcohol, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelikán.
According to the spokesperson Jurinová, forty drunken children were hospitalized until mid-November this year at the Motol Paediatric Clinic.
However, the statistics show only those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after walking medical examination, go home with parents or the police do not count.
In addition to the cases in which children simply meet after school and drink aguardiente, there are three seasonal ups and downs for Pelikán: the day of witches, the end of the year and the end of the school year.
"In such circumstances, they drink from bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"On the day of the witches I have come to see up to seven drunken children in admissions at once," adds Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and by the nutrients missing from the body.
"These carry it much better, because after the agitated night, they get up well and they don't hurt anything."
"They are only confused about where they are," says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose their temper at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
Ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for serious patients cost about tens of thousands of crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell them directly to the children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a job for young people to earn enough to pay for themselves that night," adds Pelikán.
In his view, health insurance, perhaps as a retrogressive measure, which usually reimburses people for the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are found for the first time in the hands of others in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, by which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, left for Seville on Tuesday, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time a device of this type has been in the hands of anyone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad for practice or demonstration flights.
It is the biplaza version L-159T1, which until now used the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-seat aircraft.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the sales broker, Omnipol, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peješk of the Defense Press Department indicates that it is not yet known when the planes physically will be withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the aircraft repaired long ago, without any investments or additional contributions by the Ministry."
"The two-seat L-159T1 were exchanged in their current state," Právo Pejšek told.
He added that the army did not run out of two-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 dual-seater devices.
One of the new aircraft was received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS committed to adding aircraft to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that EADS is the company that withdraws L-159 aircraft and will serve as pilots for NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework," Pejšek says.
The Hospodářské noviny newspaper published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current Directorate of Defense states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24 aircraft, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by issuing a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at the Prague airport of Kbely in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the annular indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest rate than annular are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British magazine on cancer.
They could depend on the testosterone level, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to the age of 60," said the co-author of Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, as indicated by Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of over 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the indica finger of the right hand shorter than the annular.
They had the same probabilities of prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
For men with a longer index than the annular finger, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent; for men under 60 per cent, the reduction was 87 per cent.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer can be "showed completely".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 closed
Czech Republic, like most of Europe, dawned on snow-covered Thursday.
Roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and snow-removal machines have been circulating all night through many areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between kilometers 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourisms, as well as the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of Ústředního automotoklubu (UAMK).
A truck broke down at kilometre 91, and two industrial vehicles were hit in 93, causing injuries.
Also several tourists ended up in the gutter.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometre 185 towards Prague.
There two trucks crashed.
Drivers must travel slowly after Brno at the kilometre 190 or cross Brno and enter the kilometre 182 at Kývalce.
There, several kilometres of traffic jams have been formed.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a snow layer of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
For example, blockades are taking place in Prosek, although Štěrboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
The trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, there will be another state of crisis in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Due to the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three quickly.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport closed from 11 pm on Wednesday night until 5 am.
Currently, it can already be circulated on most roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brněnska snow tongues are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Millers will be required to clear them.
At the moment it cannot be said when they will be opened to circulation.
In Hodoninska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
Roads in the region which, since it is a protected natural area, should simply be left in inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to ČTK.
In the Czech Republic they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in the north of Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfalls gradually return to the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American army is using a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the time being only by the code name XM-25.
The generals expect the new rifle to influence the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the progress of the game" to win.
The new weapons are like a small gun with an extremely precise aim.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm calibre ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains actually causes it to function as a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies who hide behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Undoubtedly, normal protection cannot be used and, when you launch your murderous rain of metal flints, it can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to it their laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and pulls the trigger."
"Let's say 543 meters have been measured."
"When the trigger is pressed, the weapon is loaded and the projectile is thrown at a distance of 543 meters, plus one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 jobs moved
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their place of work from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu is moving its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße Street in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman explained that, in the medium term, another 100 additional employees of the consortium, previously scattered throughout the region, will be accommodated there.
The offer is highly attractive, besides the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central site with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company in the region caused yesterday joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt's head of economics, Markus Frank (CDU) said that's what earned him a Global Player.
This is a "beautiful recognition of the site."
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a great impulse for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu's decision.
The address previously informed the city of its intention.
"Of course we have offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons led to the fall.
In such a way, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope that the owner and the tenant of the building will be cooperative."
The property previously used by Fujitsu at Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of Marienbader Platz's leftover buildings for ten years in a controversial spa town construction project.
As a joint project of the city and of a private company of projects between the station and the city is formed a new entrance to the city, that is responsible for the criticism regarding the massive construction that previously used the holes as parking spaces and regarding the level of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment consultancy and valuation companies, the software manufacturer for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, have been installed, as well as then joined Siemens with the Fujitsu computer manufacturer house.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Groupe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, from Tokyo, is recognized as the world's third-largest provider of IT.
It has companies, e.g. computers and servers, and also provides accurate services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is located from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the office building in Astro Park.
The ancient complex of the twenties, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anxiety is taking over more and more Wikileaks.
Amazon's internet service provider has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Possibly behind is political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, appears to be detained in England.
Wikileaks' platform of revelations is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an Internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and businesses to the Wikileaks boycott.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, must remain in detention in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from Amazon's server."
"Speaking freely in the country of freedom," the activists of the revelations communicated through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon services web in order to cope with the high numbers of access to documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Perfect, we will allocate our dollars to hiring people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, CNN reported on a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the senate's council for the country's security had threatened Amazon with boycott, said the British "Guardian".
"I had wanted Amazon to take these measures before, before previous Wikileaks classified information publications," the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and reckless Wikileaks process puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world," said an independent senator's statement.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to extend stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The internet activist has constantly described research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson stated in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid for Assange's safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to the statements of North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the person responsible for Wikileaks' revelations must be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, an advisor to the head of government Stephen Harper said, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange a great dispute grows.
Robert Gibbs, American President Barack Obama's spokesman, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had requested the resignation of the Secretary of State, in case she was responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage.
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website."
The American government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed as exceptional manager, announced the White House.
Therefore Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks filtering.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that to take care of the security of dissidents and activists, they must put the Wikileaks publication in jeopardy.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream parlors are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream shops has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
The ice cream maker and the ice cream maker.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian art of ice cream making.
With a spatula, the ice cream is removed from the counter, spreads it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream shops has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the house's own ice cream shop.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk in soft ice cream their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of this art in California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something of her own in a few years within an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice creams in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice creams.
The master ice cream maker Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants later the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste is decisive, but also its silky softness and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the cream cover of the national superior house and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to the elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it to four degrees.
Then it opens the tap of the machine and comes out a pasteurized white basic cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a stratifier?
How can some desire to experience be given loose reindeer?
Luciano advises that they lose track of the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not just natural ingredients", perhaps has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a granite ice cream sound.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Smells are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, Master Luciano distinguishes among the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the supermarket candy section.
Besides, there's dust and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to paste flavored ingredients into their merchandise."
"But you must experience it sometime."
Whether with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the cream ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and cocoa powder as a basis for all possible chocolate pleasures.
Now course participants can use the refrigerators.
Luciano lets them produce four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, moca and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
They also carry out the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
Knowing better doesn't necessarily depend on whether it has more tofe flavor or more fruit puree.
Hazelnut ice cream does not need to know about nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group produces the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice cream production is a problem of artymetics: Peach purée is used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a tool with which to fix the quantity of sugar of the types of fruit (measure of the wine grower for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make it easier to count.
Elaborating ice cream requires only physical application, as before.
It not only helps the tool for the automatic processing of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, in which the mixture of prepared ice cream is beaten simultaneously and cooled to a temperature below zero.
In spite of everything, all automation stays out as far as small pasta is concerned.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if she were a controlless giant mini-first.
"In all courses," says Master Luciano, "it's only a matter of time that something like this happens."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry experimenting with transgenic plants.
This issue is currently formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an institute for the independent evaluation of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the Efsa Expert Group on Genetically Modified Plants, and another Efsa expert have also been employed for years at the Ilsi Association.
Consortia like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to Efsa's verification standards for genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, they criticise.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
So, recently, a high-ranking manager from Ephsa went without the support and transition time to Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed her side with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and the industry, which were carried out by the General Environment Office as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, Ephsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, also some of the industry, are used, provided that they are of high quality and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working in Ephsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without the mandate of Lobby.
In this regard, independent experts, such as Then, criticise that GM plants are currently allowed without researching food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
"We want to know what, for example, makes genetically modified maize in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to check only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you going to find them?", question, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
The scientist has been investigating the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical Institute in Zurich.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, in the US and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not generally published.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck says.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday I was at Stuttgart station, with the Tube behind my back.
There were demonstrations
It was snowy.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Miles and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing was rubbled.
Rotate in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You mustn't disappear."
He is excited: "A cheap and poor, simple and natural stone."
As he once said, he's smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he's gonna do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trace of Stuttgart's stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in an earlier ammunition depot of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He's bought everything that results from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, grind the gravel or send it to the dumpster," he says in his office, a wooden house that once was a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
He spoke to the enemies of 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the downfall.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilogram block cut, with a price per piece from 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope of returning it to a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Owner of gardens, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from all over and took what they could take in the trunk and above.
The stone of Stuttgart's impulse has long become "the wall" or the boundary of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is really nothing special," Rongen says.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
He ascends to his all-terrain, makes a tour of his great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a rock lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He carries his treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the country's largest antique stone dealer.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sandstones chopped.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke Bridge," he explains.
Caliza dawn, yellow, warm, excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Note a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And keep going.
"Good travertine."
Formerly, the apples belonged to the Neckarstadion gallery in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from Stuttgart Police Headquarters, red granite from Sankt Blasien Church, toba from Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he sculpted the stones before and moved them with a simple rig and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to the stone dealer, besides yards, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the man who takes care of taking advantage of the remains.
He'll have to go to Cologne soon.
There are also stones to rescue.
Talent struggle around great potentials
There is an active influx into the buffet.
16 students flock around the rolls, the tomato soup and the sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the manufacturer of Vokswagen cars have invited to a workshop students of mechanical engineering and design.
In a kind of competition of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and learn all about Volkswagen.
Rivalling and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, meet in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: Hire the most talented students in universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications about their students' skills, they try to capture and capture exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium won the talents.
A lady in the staff department distributes pens, elbows and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the enticed young talents the internship programs and the jobs for students and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig takes the project with VW.
See advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, watch interesting candidates more closely and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are wanted so directly.
"The main point previously was in the technical projects," Selle says.
The struggle for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not they have to be announced and, above all, to get a highly skilled workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacant engineer posts in October.
And, according to VDI's forecasts, this engineering vacuum will grow even further.
At the audit and advisory firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for the talent hunt.
It organizes expensive recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincan, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the US the following year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG's subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the cream of the cream of many participants goes to the USA.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the masses."
"The simple journey alone was short for us."
For the Dykta hunters the notes give results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all participants."
"Some are close to their end, and they want to apply to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their labour fairs, are also on the hunt.
"We're trying to get students at specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, staff manager for Solarworld's solar technology manufacturer.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently, 35 vacancies appear on the company ' s website.
"It is very difficult to fill vacant posts."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter way is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that you can practice with us or perform your thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That's why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: Personal environment, plain hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium cannot normally offer it," says Stübe, the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good opportunities for promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany's top 100 employers.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in it and observes the employees' previous conditions.
Stübe, the staff manager also expects extra points in her classification for her aspiring to work.
"I believe that the applicant is particularly concerned with the external classifications of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employee Branding Akademie advises companies who want a long-term strategy to gain a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer goes through the employees themselves," he says.
In the jargon of the sector is called Employee Branding internal, also promotion of corporate identity within the staff itself.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," says Kriegler.
Obama Stops New Oil Perforations
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in recent years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thereby overturned its previous plans in an unappealable manner.
Also on the Atlantic coast remain new holes sealed for the moment.
This was announced by the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will be in effect for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in April.
Before the misfortune that cost eleven workers their lives and caused the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted further drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
Supporters wanted to reduce US dependence on new oil supplies abroad.
To date, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced with millions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the minister of the interior, lifted the moratorium on drilling after the explosion.
Subsequently, several peterole consortia submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible supervisory authority, which after being charged with corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, is undergoing root reform.
Obama announces in parallel that the lucrative fiscal loopholes for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that the total extraction in the Gulf will be smaller thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey conducted by the BDO consulting company - before Wednesday's ban on mining.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are rapidly prolonged, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil marble, it smells like a gas station: Millions of litres of crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live by theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is fine with it.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures journalists: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wandering in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is not seen that brown oil spots float on the surface.
He used to pick shrimp here, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the flowing waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
The fishes around the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach waters full of fish: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and situated in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most stinking regions in the world.
On the way to the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine removes a brown broth, which plunges its hand into the water, will pull out some filled with oil.
The roots of the trees of the mangroves rise from the ground like dark sticks of licorice, sadly isolate the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain are sought flocks of birds, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier from the outside is shut, a kind of ghostly calm of an earlier paradise with a smell of gas station expands in it.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," says, "Huran, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
It's a war comparison.
The zone of the settlement of the Ogoni is a fierce battlefield for years: here the first European explorers broke in more than 60 years ago, here was organized the first resistance in the 80s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today it is forbidden to return companies to Ogoniland: While daily pumping more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire delta region, three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometres of pipes, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred metres of steel platforms stood out as strafular water sculptures: "Christmas Trees" affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
Every moment a head fails, Akpobari says, then he drives a constant stream of oil into the water.
According to the experts' assessments, more than two billion litres have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the wreck of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in the history of mankind.
Whoever is responsible for the lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, ecologists see the heads about to break and leak pipes as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the world to conventional ones, scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only the defect indexes of the pipes are "about a multiple greater than elsewhere."
In a place, which from afar seems forgotten, there appears a workshop full of oil under the open sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire flames: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil heats up in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, the gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the container, later the oil pipe drips and eventually comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 liters of diesel daily: "It brings us 34,000 naira", around $22.
The people of the delta take advantage of the shortage of fuel in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros-cent per litre the illegal heaters can offer even less: Thus they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers," who tricked the pipeline network through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this rate at least 16 million litres of oil per day is lost throughout the Niger Delta.
Only an insignificant part of the stored provisional raw material is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, to which they also belong politicians and high military officials, keep the best part in aljibes and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or to the loose mode of production to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies did not act as invaders and would not have completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the Ogoni are destroyed above all by Shell to the point that only a deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like the Chinese."
Michael's getting nervous.
"It's about time you disappeared," says the muscular Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come any minute."
If the special unit of the army catches the illegal refiners, it does not threaten them to arrest them, except with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of raw materials.

Researchers detect hazardous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic engine failure."
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Airbus passengers from Qantas who made an emergency landing in early November were far more fortunate than you can imagine: Australian air safety authorities perceived, thanks to their investigations, a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and warned of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a cuff connection, cracks can be caused by fatigue or cracks, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic engine failure."
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus which had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline initiates legal media against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit with the Sidney Federal Court that allowed for more legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, Qantas director, stated that his airline will claim compensation for the early November incident.
In the engine brand they have lost parts and their wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from all over the world have to be replaced.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out more safety tests on superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesman for ATSB.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its fleet A380 on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of its eleven A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double decked plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A Nevada all over the country causes traffic chaos
Totally white Germany: From day to day it has snowed in almost the whole country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
The winter freezes Germany: In almost all the country, freezing temperatures were reached during Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and many streets.
In the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the snowbreakers are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not prepared.
In addition, strong winds sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects live tides with water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic Sea coast Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to meteorological service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimetres of newly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are in charge of whirling it.
There many trucks and cars were trapped overnight.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, police authorities reported major street riots.
In the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Turingia the snows affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disorders are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on the lanes or the broken chain and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, Leipzig's long distance service to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Turingia an ICE train had to stop its trip to Munich.
Firemen and the rescue service took care of the 165 passengers on the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
Winds with snow sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, snow winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokesman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman for Fraport, there are already 40 flights cancelled.
The snowbreakers are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 country beds prepared for them.
On many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a trucker died in a collision with a train at a track crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to the snowy streets: Here too a truck was hit at a track crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the Bayreuth route to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died, after turning her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be softer and dustier and will therefore swirl on soft streaks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and rapid winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution seeks buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank arranged its headquarters: Twin towers were modernized in the Frankfurt bank district; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to take advantage of the cost of the meeting, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland claims on the basis of a spokesman.
The spokesman does not mention the reasons for the sale in project.
"We always check whether it is appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then rent them again," he said.
That's why Germany's largest credit institution is renouncing its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investor of a home fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached a figure of approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would be a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field estimate the value of the newspaper's towers renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
If the renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor, it has not been revealed at the moment, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourn for the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who were killed after many explosions in a mine.
However, corpses have not been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion in the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced into the place of misfortune, but no sign of survival was discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment was able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts concluded that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Today family members and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the glowing sunshine in Greymouth on the southern New Zealand island.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items under clothing and surfboards.
The flags waved at half a pole in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," said John Key, president of the New Zealand government, to the participants in the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
In the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African miners were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the island of southern New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the burning temperatures inside the mine will begin to descend, said Gary Knowles, the police superior, to journalists.
To hell with it, warrior!
Does the gore fit into the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn again explores the boundaries of the genre with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience would Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when rolling "Walhalla Rising"?
A single-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators who seek bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and tear his enemies out the guts of their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, doesn't say almost any words throughout the film and the other characters get carried away by as much as one or two sentences or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise they remain silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the backstages offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for filmmakers grown and interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several target groups it is a shame that they cannot be ruled out each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and the trilogy about the drug-dealing hairstyle "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with something more humorous in the mainstream or something less brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and sprouting guts cannot deter most of the followers of artistic cinema.
Most of the fans of the action die of boredom, if Unejo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck for an eternity in calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shut up there again.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinematographic distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, there is a piece of cinema sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film does not deal with dialogues or a logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn has just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy trance soundtrack make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a young blond, who faithfully supports Unejo, retains something as innocence, all others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of one eye, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Land Movements
The IAEA nuclear power organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this subject until controls are allowed.
On the middle of the night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I warplanes attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometers is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it deals with a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley coming out of the river.
According to information from the CIA's U.S. international intelligence service at the end of April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the proximity of the very appropriate al-Kibar for plutonium production, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves any other purpose than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or from the interior.
The reactor had been in operation for a short time, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years later from the bombing, it is little more known than at that time, the puzzles became bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was fully confident that the Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but that it saw little evidence that there was a "nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible".
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how sure it was to have a reactor ahead, a high-ranking UN diplomat responded in a stoning way in the summer that the IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions."
The Syrians quickly disposed of the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and raided the ground conscientiously.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, from commercial vendors just after the attack, which must have greater information value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as unlikely after particle analysis.
Since then Damaskus has refused to discuss the matter, just as with regard to satellite images.
In addition, controllers are prohibited from a second inspection of the Kibar and entry into the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not produced any results since June 2008 and "is gradually becoming a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, a serious violation of the non-proliferation of atomic weapons treaty, for which the IAEA monitors, is pending.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in enlightenment, which must be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not made public until what equipment they are dealing with, what functions they have, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as interns, again derived from the proximity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and located a building complex near Masyaf with satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspect objects.
It is possibly located at or immediately next to a military base, and Syria therefore prohibits entry to all three locations at the IAEA.
In Vienna, it is said that Syrians fear a record that the US has asked the IAEA to spy on military plants.
The nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment thanks to warnings from the U.S. Secret Service.
Through satellite photographs, IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three locations and the cube on the Euphrates shore.
A Western diplomat with a high office in Vienna stated that at least one of the teams may be "related to fuel production".
But there is no "significant evidence of sensitive activities", uranium enrichment or refurbishment; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is activated with uranium that is not enriched.
Where the uranium should come from and where the plutonium for the pumps should subsequently be separated, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
Nor is there any doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can be recovered, are in all three places.
As the hundreds of cargoes from the ground trucks disappeared, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The IOAE considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located within a few kilometres from the Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as an area for radioactive waste, to be unlikely.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked her to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show that Syrians moved land in the three suspected suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be random, but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that IAEA has spent a few months developing an inspection plan there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors ' interest.
Meanwhile, Damascus also criticizes this proposal.
The Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador fencing the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: For this, the majority of the IAEA governing council is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat thought: "What if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in the Times of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the address of her debut still unnamed.
She herself wrote the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations have quickly protested, and at the last moment they moved a few planned filming days in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, told a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
It is not diplomatic, weeks ago the women offered him a meeting in Hungary that he rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
There are no love stories given in the rape camps, and Jolie's position on it gives the victims enough on the script.
His organization, in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended removing Jolie as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, granted behind a strip and loosens a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go despite everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, is very much involved in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains vague.
On the network there is a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and they meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnia, is deported to a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "victim of rape falls in love with torturer".
It's certain that Jolie's film really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on wrong information."
They can now achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script remains on the network illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here.
This afternoon it's finally good for the Irish.
No sign of distress
Instead, the home team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans shout with joy as the loud music resounds, hitting the ground with their feet.
The Bailey Club vibrates in the South Irish Cork, because players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus some plane tickets to Las Vegas for the world championship beerpong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this junkie drinking game and the discreet computer don't actually make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, distract himself from the fulminant question, what the future will be like.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"He's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from a throw he got the work of his dreams as event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, her brother Colin currently works as an IT advisor in Londrés.
Young people leave: On the island there are many families like that of the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, forecast economic experts and the social research institute ESRI in Dublin.
Up to 2015 there are 200,000 emigrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
Forecasts are confirmed, a migration wave comparable to that suffered by the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress that brought great welfare to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses above all the young, well-formed Irish people, for whom so far everything is uphill.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
"There should be a uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and with it to an entire generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a bleak future appearing because the government is only dedicated to assembly and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they don't have strategies to get new jobs," says the 20-year-old girl.
He observes how his colleagues go from uncollected practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to lead your career," says the manager.
Photos of a boy surfing in Australia and a boy snowboarding in Canada can be found on his website.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in jails, but it involves freedom and fun.
For half a year, Sean O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something else.
Since there was nothing more to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
Now they're setting up a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime to be able to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as it was a long time ago when he first stepped on the threshold of his home.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs a little bit embarrassed and goes for cold rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with careful gardens in front of the houses, in the entrance are parking large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent funded by a credit.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he hears often today.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by far, as dramatic as in times past here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe with it we feel for the first time like Irish."
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Let the future go and just see what life is like somewhere else.
You've worked a couple of years in London, and why wouldn't it go well with him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But in these days there is one thing that worries you extremely: the celebration of your 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it might degenerate at a farewell party.
"Only not too many emotions," he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Good-bye, sounds very distressing."
"We better call it a marching party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private companies, continues to increase.
Crime generates more concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it is possible to monitor changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively mood prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in a number of countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew up in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a great decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see figure 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably more than 25 per cent in 2001 (figure 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted their country ' s Congress and 45 per cent trusted their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it was sustained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and has again decreased this year to 32%.)
However, the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see figure 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see figure 5).
Around 31 per cent say that they or a close relative have been victims of crime in the past year, a figure that has been reduced since 38 per cent last year and that is the lowest percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region say that private enterprises are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see figure 6).
About 58 per cent agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow your country to develop, compared to 47 per cent last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same (and 80% support private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as reported by 19 per cent of respondents (compared to 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent compared to 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered most influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the waste
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, there was much worse than what foreigners were afraid of trying to help the country go back to its problems.
Votes were put in the ballot boxes, some people voted several times, ballot papers thrown in the sewers, destroyed polling stations and acts of intimidation.
The polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, were wandering around the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the cancellation of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were "a relatively good election in many ways."
Observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The tie-off is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes for the elections have yet been lost.
The two main candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial request to invalidate the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has little support, if any, has moved on to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic is devastating the country and more than a million earthquake survivors are still living in tents, a great deal of abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents needed to vote had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider the election of a popular and legitimate government to be an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has become clear, so do the Haitians themselves.
Moving from dots to the center
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, up to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
In spite of all that, it may turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to take charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the custom of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's death due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one deputy punched another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply next year, which will give the President even greater room for action when it comes to spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1 per cent, but many private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of trade unions, place it at about 30 per cent.
Mr. Kirchner, who assumed power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and made INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now change these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit salary increases in the next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports worldwide.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a prior forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new price index for national consumption, which seems to prelude to the cleaning of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to remain in politics when she finishes her term, bearing in mind that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has been tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for it will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not to reject, quietly, many of your husband's policies.
Half Hurrah for China
Taiwanese voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about his big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of the eligible, came on 27 November to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become an advocate of feelings for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but little by little.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayor's elections, he failed to obtain the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (PPD), which has leaned towards full independence from Taiwan, obtained almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If they had been the president, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote ratio has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the city halls.
In the elections you could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy country trucks and large crowds with banners and light girls of dancing clothes.
Nor did the mysterious attempt at rigorous murder fail.
Sean Lien, Lien Chan's son, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or to avenge the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the shooting affected the elections, raising suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not being addressed.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing and job creation plans.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Therefore, the KMT often avoids publicizing its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PDP also avoided encouraging the sentiment against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma stated that his policy towards China had been confirmed to be acceptable to most Taiwanese people.
The Government of Beijing is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the fold.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
The best thing to do is to wait until the 2012 presidential elections are over.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed for corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under Mrs Tsai's leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PDP is working to attract professionals and young people.
Ms Tsai has been welcomed as a PDP candidate for the presidency, as has Her Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now your party is doing everything it can to prove that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a point of contact between the PDP and China, provided that negotiations can be carried out without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to introduce the presidents.
Even without Mr Chen interceding, the PPD will find it difficult to choose from among its potential candidates.
The KMT must also carry out a conscientious examination.
Mr Ma's assessments have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will restructure his cabinet, as well as local teams.
Large PDP samples suggest Taiwan's support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Artist revelation.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammys' surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the Best Artist Revelation category.
Taking into account that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination gives what to think, but respects the rules of the Grammys according to which he must be an artist who has not taken more than three albums out of the market before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly represented a great advance and, taking into account his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, can at least make a distinction between Spalding and the path to the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for the Grammys voters, who have recently focused on the jazz field for this category.
In the other categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity", an exciting and magnificent record that was one of the favorites last year.
Iyer's competitors include veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a stark New Orleans favourite guest at HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest leans considerably towards fusion as in Stanley Clarke's albums John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society earned a well-deserved recognition in the category of big groups, competing against the great chamber jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the always risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bass player's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classic albums
Nominations in the classical music field for the 53rd edition of the Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for three movements eclectic orchestra.
Among the nominees with links to southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Nominations of classical music are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestra, opera, choir and solo albums.
The year's classic producer category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphony No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium - the Art of the Castrati" of several artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg by "Lulu" from the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers nominated for a Grammy by contemporary compositions include Pärt by Symphony No. 4, Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze by "Apartamentemente Plus", Magnus Lindberg by "Graffiti" and Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for playing in Mandolin Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the category of orchestra function, for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
The nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, Soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The mosque proposed in Temecula obtains the approval of the commission of order
The mosque project for Temecula has obtained unanimous support from the local order commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying it fosters terrorism and jams.
However, the members of the commission decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha'is, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"Demonstrates that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only they speak very loudly."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time it was devoted to people who intercede for or against the center, almost the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"The United States no longer exists," is read in one of the comments.
"This is another ape planet with Mrs. Freedom dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Plans to build Islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the 11 September 2011 attacks took place.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has reported acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living together smoothly in Riverside County for years, but wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he was renting on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe poses the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new life forms on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it a very peculiar thing, although little is needed to be a really 'alien' kind of way of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the Thursday online edition of the Science publication.
For a long time, there have been six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets different from Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated great speculation on the Internet about the possibility of the report indicating the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "shows is that in other planetary environments, there may be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the investigation team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the replacement of one element by another in the biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's astrobiology institute, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so it speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, it may be difficult for different organisms to differentiate them."
"However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus, so it enters and, to put it another way, takes the biochemical machinery," Anbar explains.
The researchers collected bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, to which they were able to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that it can exist naturally a way of life that uses arsenic, whether in other parts of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example had never been found to prove that it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth eras, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
"Yes, it suggests that there could be other ways to generate life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past," Foster said, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institutes.
The missing stolen dogs have been found in Compton.
The two dogs missing from the four stolen in front of the Bellflower motel have been found, according to officers of the Los Angeles County sheriff on Thursday.
The four competing dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck that they were spending the night in front of Bellflower Motel 6, as authorities pointed out.
Two of the canines recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met on Wednesday evening, as reported by Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are okay," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They're back with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore didn't want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not suffered damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the competitions in the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were to be shown in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, according to Peek to The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the almost two-month tour of the couple participating in dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of your bedroom window.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer's boy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so that dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was not clear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM gets the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally achieved green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the "pre-armed" plan by creditors to erase approximately $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering films and television programs.
Thursday's ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to be revived under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit facility to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management necessary to order its finances, while struggling to be able to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and bankruptcy business recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial tribulations and satisfy the more than 140 creditors in the study took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion the creditors were looking for.
Before spring this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began to work on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally endorsed by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been collecting $375,000 a month for its company's administration services, will receive a "successful fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and gathered an annual board of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to make a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep your budget balance for gifts
While the iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant apple in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five $99 BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
Recently I visited three national toy vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law has been working; this year's technological toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less than last year's.
In addition, while there are usually fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys powered by button batteries are increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for 3 years and more) are plush toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when they tighten their bellies.
A squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze begins to arm a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once it starts tightening, it cannot stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-shift games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative feet articulated with wheels with locking device.
The children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of question cards designed to convert a ride into a session with a self-correction exercise book.
If you are suspicious of giving your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech MobiGo (60 dollars, 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although the games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, 3 to 12 years old), it is the first important development of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL (90 dollars, 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has a SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks just bigger than a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to arm words by putting the blocks in line before time runs out; it is formidable for an improvised word-arm competition.
There are more and more toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on its presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, (5 dollars, 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you change the code online, your child gets enough credits in the Penguin Club store for two items.
These could include roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the pig of his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the latest in a line of button-powered microrobots.
The fake insect moves quickly over 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog's mouth.
Promotes a more moderate side of law enforcement in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the way into a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the corpulent police of China's urban order, feared and despised by their bold whimsical measures and their inclination to violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Signify!"
"Warning!"
Show them, he whispered, "How are the pretty girls!"
Four girls who barely passed adolescence with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly aligned.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of the hair tied with blue and white stripes.
"Personally, I think they look normal," Mr. Tang said, disdainfully.
"Models are cute."
More than one government has tried to clear the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree degree.
Guangdong Province changed the greyish green color from uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a sloppy snack cart, and observed it with a frown constantly for half an hour, until the street salesman picked up his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, specifically elected for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough cop a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's little respect for these city squads.
And for a good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors beat a passerby to death after using their cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the internet, describing how to effectively beat criminals without bleeding them.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon street salesman suffered brain damage after a fight with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for download online, presents inspectors trained by Chinese who attack street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar in the government," lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another tactical controversy.
The newspaper demanded "a really meticulous cleaning."
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested eight new female recruits through a notice in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered whether women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district notice called for female candidates from 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They should have a height above the average, greater than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said that work was physically too difficult for women over 25 years of age.
"His image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities".
The female Chengguan are like vases, he said, and added, "In addition to being florists, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not looking forward to supporting this description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job announcements for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured must not be present.
"We cannot allow a person to catch or a hump to come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his colored cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old workmate with dimples, Xu Yang, said "Our work must present the image of the city."
They also don't object to their work on time, they said, because they harbor career ambitions that are greater than simply driving away vendors in the alleys where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squadron faces more or less a dozen street vendors who throw themselves on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many tofu rolls or bowls as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his bike-drawn car with noodle garrisons.
The officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is more or less the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his hours off.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the merchandise of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan's provincial capital, rioted after the false rumor spread that Chengguan officers had killed a salesman.
More than a dozen Chengguan policemen or officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were thrown or set on fire.
For the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is barely guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike shouted rudely.
The situation was quenched for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened up to the elbows to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 and over, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr.Li with total naturality.
"Most of the time it's the audience that starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday that the Department of Justice prosecutors have excused Senator John Ensign from the criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work through lobbying for the wife's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat faced by Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal about his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said he was "surely happy" with the decision, which came after an entire year of investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary action from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said that the Justice Department had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plan to press charges against him on this issue."
The Department of Justice did not wish to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have conspired to violate a federal criminal lobby ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, obtain lucrative work through lobbying, to achieve Hampton's silence and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton's job and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban," which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the ground-breaking door statute," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Department of Justice officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the middle of charges for misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's chief lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a DOJ prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to press charges against his client.
Ensign's defence team had been cooperating with prosecutors in trying to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which claims that a payment of $96,000 from Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said that it did not have enough evidence to prove that money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got work through lobby thanks to Ensign's help to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was "masking" the Ministry of the Interior on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told journalists that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the Department of Justice's example and complete its investigation.
"Senator Ensign wants to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chating" in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, says the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the imposition of the death penalty judge voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have submitted writings to the court outlining the arguments of the appeals that are likely to occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere", and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appellate judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I experienced during this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Senior Counsel for Mr. Hayes' defense.
First-instance judge Jon C. Blue of the State High Court laconically rejected the lawsuits in a judgment last week, saying that the news media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was led by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that the coverage of successful cases can generate questions about the impartiality of a trial.
In a historic judgment of 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the conviction of an osteopath from Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television program and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general cause for concern about the impact of the new media" in high profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford School of Laws, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report saying that it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courtrooms could make trials more fair.
The issue of Twitter is just one of many issues outlined by Hayes' lawyers, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them creepy pictures of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said that they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11.
The defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized the prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
The jurors weren't kidnapped.
But your arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media were continually throwing firewood of emotion on the case.
"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters out of court," the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state."
Your attention to Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly was a ludicrous vision that would make court policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the appellate courts were often attracted to the arguments about the adaptation required in the courts because of social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the 1966 decision of the Supreme Court, which revoked Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the coverage of the trial, and made it clear that they would require that the new media would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can civilism build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a notable campaign for invective and negativity, a little civicism has been unleashed in Washington this week.
Is it an omen of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to the party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders did not produce any progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from what everyone says, it was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to win party points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the president's deficit committee was equally civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a trial period, canvassing each other to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed party war.
This is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent evaluations of the meeting by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and deeply rooted to suggest any rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two parties are in opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way things are said," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They're inevitable after the election.
The elections awaken partisan passions, which then become extinct.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are won at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans cannot make them believe that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112nd Congress meets in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement should begin.
"After the things to be done are carried out, in the short term psychology will revert the situation to a confrontational one," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civicism can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as an essay for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they must try to keep their promises of cutting state spending and nullifying the new health law.
These lines of support are already clearly reflected in the initial reactions to the deficit commission's recommendations, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase of some taxes and retirement age, and the reduction of expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken care of one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forcibly introduced the issue of the deficit into the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance lies among the officials elected to the panel, suggesting that in tax matters there are, at least at present, few bases or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first will take place next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama about the budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a standstill, as happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe people's reaction.
Anyone who thinks he's losing will probably change course and seek compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
Partyism and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in Congress than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties view 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground in the issues that still divide them.
A leaked American document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "cleptocracy", and leaves a part of the bribes and protection money that it collects directly from the Kremlin, according to the U.S. Embassy in Russia in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority," takes its share as money climbs on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have systematically denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several lawsuits for libel over such accusations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt, he said, "It's crazy, it's a bitch, it's a mess."
According to surveys, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unusual for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government with crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to assert that the government works more like a kleptocracy than a government," the note says.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means 'roof' or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
"The analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
"SFS, MVD and militia are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects money from the larger companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, "explained that the commercial owners of Moscow understand that it is best to achieve the protection of MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while money collection is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports on men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indiam's expert group in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, India estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154 (countries are ranked at least as corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy's note, which did not occur until late in Moscow's hour, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation claiming that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would be done in such an immoral way."
The veterans of the Red Jemers forced to face the past
In a concrete classroom weakly lit, with stained and peeled walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Red Jemers.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and cared about his people," said 42-year-old Mr. Kor Ma.
Known as the "Carnicero" for his brutality during the government of the Red Jemers, the commander remains popular in this remote former fortress of the Red Jemers in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemers surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a secondary school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Red Jemers to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations and Cambodia court issued the first conviction of a former member of the Red Jemers, sentencing the former head of known torture centre Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Red Jemeres of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Red Jemers, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Jemers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the government of the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, sickness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowed the Pol Pot-led government in 1979, the regime's remains and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Jemer fighters began deserting the government, culminating in Ieng Sary's 1996 returns and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while waiting for the trial.
Without the support of its benefactors, the oldest fighters of the Red Jemers fell into absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite officials of the Red Jemers retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, the low-level soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have obtained few benefits after surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any concept to do business."
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemeres when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemers was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to self-supply."
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
Early next year, the court is expected to start prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Jemers.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the main leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This didn't help much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced labourers are believed to have died.
During a recent stunned afternoon, Im Chaem returned to work in the fields at his home on wooden pilots on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the dry pasture, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemeres.
She stated that if the court summoned her, she would not appear.
"Camboya is at peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Red Jemers in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Camboya must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to rejoin the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first textbook approved by the government on the Red Jemeres, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the secondary school history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Red Jemeres.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Red Jemeres, despite the city's link to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to produce an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Jemers retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a black soot rectangle covered by a rusty can roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the roadside, said he didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last rest, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of having good luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its reserve of qualified uranium for armaments
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will renounce its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement issued after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to renounce its highly enriched uranium and it seemed that they had reached a point with no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of classified operations were carried out with Belarus in the past two months, to remove 84.82 kg of weapons-qualified uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to one official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the topic.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically qualified uranium for armaments) and low-enrichment uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials stated that the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that travelled over 2,000 km to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to staff, the second operation ended on Monday and was carried out by plane.
The US government spent $13 million on the task, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with low-enriched uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working on Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence" which led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of qualified uranium for armaments, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will seek to eliminate its reservation by 2012, according to the joint declaration.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential relaxation.
It was stated that "while welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus acknowledged that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens".
The Spanish Government did not repair CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading to Guantánamo for Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice president of the government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked the Spanish Executive to be informed "to be able to demonstrate that they were exercising appropriate surveillance over foreign planes passing through Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, including Spain, a meeting took place between former American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken Zapatero's government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights across Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "unsuspected," Aguirre says on a cable.
Also the then foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, as it was in the hands of the judges, the government had a limited capacity to influence."
For his part, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements or sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors", rather than the declassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, at a luncheon between the US ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told him that "although the Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflammatory rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP's action in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US government," he says.

The 30-year-old Galician girl started a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Túñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When he was left, she was soon known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
Soon he met another boyfriend.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, neighboring municipality.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the little one stayed with his partner, who even went to Palma for a week.
But because of the content of the communications, you can see that your romance broke, that they broke.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and musque, because I have come to work."
"When I told him he felt good, but of course, now he realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not be free to do what he wants."
Then he talks about a message to the mobile that he just received: "I want you to turn this month or give me an address to send the child."
She complains: "If she doesn't like leaving the kid with my mother, I'll pick him up when he gets back," she claims.
In May, he talks about going back to his village: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only be there until the 19th, because the 20th I have to introduce myself to a job so I don't lose it."
He makes it clear that if everything goes well, he takes his firstborn.
"I'm going to be with the one who should be, that is, with me, and I'll never think of leaving him again with anyone other than my mother," dubious intention given his bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When he types it, the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly killed on the 10th, is supposed to be dead.
"César is happy on the one hand, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other he's going to class almost every day."
He's talking about a transfer to Majorca.
"He will go there (the child) to some summer classes, and thus save me some kangaroo dough."
On the 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know which videos to the email, look how when he wants to find me, he has to fuck up."
The 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
Of Victor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money".
On the internet there are messages from you on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where he called himself "Muki the jailer."
"Terror to the Galician (heading)."
The last man who lived with her, a sworn guard, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered yesterday at the provincial penitentiary of Palma, from the centre of judicial detainees in Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the facts happened, "not having intended to cause any harm to the minor."
Rather, he did confess that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and placed his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested psychiatric evidence.
The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has the view set in the general elections because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in these elections usually doubles to the one it receives in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the Catalan popular obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, the figure was 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has been fuelled by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the retention of the PP electorate, is maintained, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the CFP could increase from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would establish that the Catalan square is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one deputy - now he has three - while ICV would stay with one deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate event will take place in May 2011 with municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its relief to the head of the Barcelona City Council, one of the administrations that most budget manages - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalist and popular agree on the possibility that the PSC loses the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not obtain majority or possibility to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can lead the revolution in the Tarragonese capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been located only 500 votes away from the PSC, whose mayor, Ángel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
Popular people have also grown up in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
Catalan Cell Facilitated Thousands of Passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the General Police Information Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, headed from Thailand, provided passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the latter author of the Bombay bombings that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that "operation Kampai" has "weakened" Al Qaeda's falsification apparatus at the international level and, "therefore, its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that their "combatants" can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The disassembled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network operated in Europe, hence that in the investigations have participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the territory of the EU there are similar blows carried out in the coming days to the one developed last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was developed in Thailand with the capture of the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who headed the cell from Bangkok based in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was beaten in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents should be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
In the media of the investigation it is emphasized that, for the moment, no data has been found linking the arrested in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, some 1,000 dollars were sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended the life of 106 people.
The police have seized abundant documentation.
The PP requires Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Arthur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already proposed during the campaign and which is summed up in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and to dispense with filo-soveranist adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to pose in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the certainty that she obtained 18 deputies in last Sunday's elections, a figure more than enough to make herself wanted, because the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise to abstain in the vote of investiture.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but, for the time being, the talks that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are being conducted in Catalan.
And as for the president of the PP, in order to support an investiture "all sovereignist and independentist discourses will have to be parked", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader intends even to submit to referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to thinning the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric states that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that their cellist killed more than 11 elders
The managers of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage that has caused the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while employed there killed at least eleven elderly who were in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared with the lawyer of the center, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to press charges against the person responsible" for the deaths but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And it is that in addition to the social destabilization that the entity may suffer because it has not detected the criminal activities of the separator in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that is already being calculated by the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and has since never stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the order ordering the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatrics - who suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but that, according to the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this end yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures can never have been the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is not a single indication in the case that there has been an reckless action by anyone other than the accused."
The one already baptized as "Angel de la Muerte" confessed before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that the first crime committed it on August 29, 2009 to, one and a half months later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by punctured him with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by helping him with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the centre have access to medicines.
The punctures of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his quest to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify whether Vila did not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or whether, on the contrary, he burned them from the inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the cellist, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out him being superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after he has successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say that they are made available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday warning "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Peripheral differentials have closed strongly and the shares of European banks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ECB's ability to make a mistake, and the euro has hardly re-emphasized what is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that just as it collapses is recovered but motivated by the closure of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the government debt purchase plan on account of ineffectiveness and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures over time and leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that you will continue your bond purchase programme and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, may God assist us!
As at their May meeting in which they stated that they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and collapsed markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazuca on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million at 5.28%, compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures for Allied and Bank of Ireland's hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potentials and have until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are available under the Aid Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax the tension towards the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which a political commitment is needed that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President was given the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four stations of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Banco de España has been swift and decisive and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key three-year bond auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will be resolved with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Help Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available triple that in March, at very expensive rates and closes you access to markets sine die.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being, to seem so."
Cheer up, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The temporary does not abate in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, by considering it "full-fledged", the judicial board of El Enebro next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and to make use of the management bodies of the titular firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary Joseph are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their dispute over control by the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding company does not seem willing to give in to his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Janebro.
From his board of directors he was unbalanced by five of his seven children who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has reopened the box of thunders within the Álvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants their five children to, through procedural argument, in clear law fraud and abuse of law, try to validate and heal the radically null junta of January 18," according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the Board to challenge it once it has been held, considering it to be "full-fledged".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully tried to have the magistrate convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's seven children control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims the usufruct on 51 per cent of the capital, according to family protocols.
This case is the substantive issue to be decided by the judge once the hearing on the appeal is held, for which there is not yet a specified date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
A software designs improvements in cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into Formula One in 2004, his story in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived squad and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship they all bet on the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without demeriting the ability to pilot the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from the high car competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design assembly chains of manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable failures and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in his Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that the squids in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 young high-skilled professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all sorts of changes in the bolides.
Siemens manager explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull bolidos with the exception of the engine, which is Renault's entire responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be brought from virtual reality from simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this insanity of technological improvement is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most every season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its bolides in a locality about 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret."
The staff for this task is 580 people, including his two pilots, Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull Formula One, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, are hidden other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety null.
The head of technology of the factory, Steve Nevey, claims that five years ago it could be said that the advances in R & D in wagon cars contributed 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds 85% of the success, while the pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computer science because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive shop in collaboration are its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will match this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, set as an example the remodeled shop located in the Gran Via Barcelonesa, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 branding points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems also assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group advises and handles the exclusive furniture design of the shops (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims "to improve customer and SME service in purchasing, care, after-sales and even packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program worldwide that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP's computer equipment in warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies already have technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell's bet on stealing a million customers from his rivals in three years.
More optimistic than other managers, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for banking, but initially discards a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
However, it provides for a breakdown of the interest margins, which will be partly offset by increases in commissions and the price of the credit.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private customers, his outstanding subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new three-year master plan in 2011.
The objective, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to the public aid of FROB, is to gain market share with the capture of a million new private customers - 700,000 if you discount those who can leave the bank -, its great outstanding subject, since until now it had pampered more SMEs and companies than the retail client.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in private individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with reduced costs as objective, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the world bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year his Optima master plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation has made it a further exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main goal.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And while he believes that the passive war - which penalizes margins - is shrinking, the price of the risk premiums that banks and boxes are paying for their issues to obtain liquidity is already shifting to the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it is going to be a pressure on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto already gave orders to his network on Thursday to limit the credit in the long term and raise the price of the differentials - see CinqueDías of 22 and 27 November-.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend now "is to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that in Spain "greater sizes are going to be required."
"Next year everything will move," he said.
He claims that the capital needs are "very high" and does not rule out any Spanish financial institution entering in red numbers.
And he points out that FROB can supply the market with funds in response to new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it remained important to what some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which dampens the crisis.
The ECSC discards a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday a wave of mergers of savings banks and reiterated the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When he started the process of concentrating the Spanish savings banks, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think the largest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Banking group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; instead of 17 we may go to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been done and supervised by the Banco de España, which has also collaborated a lot," said the manager.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has explained that the process of concentration is being undertaken "at the fastest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is occurring within the deadlines that in its day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Banco de España", he emphasized.
"Spending 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion assets to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no match in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Banco de España does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The manager pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has embarked on a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new measures of adjustment, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private agencies of placement or suppression of the 426 euros of assistance to unemployed without benefit, until the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and of 30% of Lotteries of the State.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How do you interpret these movements?
Go forward that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of many of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, even though it now seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to violating countries, possible suspension of payments from any of them and extension of the costs of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there is no excuse.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government took a constitutional reform out of hand to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans of fiscal rigour and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended Greece's rescue decision.
Already then it was fiercely criticized, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public and published opinion were very much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, again Merkel emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union's treaties, in order to make possible the rescue of a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run at a part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweet, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should be attending the process of reforming the Union that will enable those measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which he may not agree very much, from that date on the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries will be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves in default of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also incur part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, productivity improvements and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, simply won't tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And it would be wrong not to understand.
It is not just a question of bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand of us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater peace of mind.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity that we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, the thesis that we have to put order at home has opened up.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it doesn't look like they're going to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, the possibility of leaving a monetary zone too crowded with unscrupulous countries, cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and law enforcement fraud
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax prove witty but unwilling to escape a sanction.
The alleged expulsion by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match held on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether such behavior is anti-sport and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately wasted time in taking out faulty paths to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
That way, and since Real Madrid will end up as leader of its group, both players will meet the regulatory penalty the next game of the bass, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean cards to the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches, and the players involved with different economic amounts.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the reported case is due to the fact that he has been starred by a team of the Real Madrid entity (who in his anthem presumes of nobility and honor, and who in past times has fined his players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether such behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether such actions involve the commission of legal fraud; they are, in fact, actions which are respectful of the sports regulation, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question goes on to examine the type of damage they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the assets that understands the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not put in jeopardy, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with the clean game is to prevent the team of the infringing players from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which did not happen either.
However, the paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it was not suited to what we normally characterized as a trap or fraud of law, because its violation of the rules was not made in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but rather that its action tried to be the most obvious to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage offenders gain from the intentional misdemeanours examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that the rival is not put in a disadvantageous position and profit is not obtained in the same game, because obviously the result of the action means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club won't be able to count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will begin the next phase of the League of Champions without cards that may threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminateness, as the team can be eliminated from the first of the changes, and also with this performance the players fulfill a penalty game and pass to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards is produced with a less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go through rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions do not run counter to the sporting spirit, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that will benefit the most from what the rules allow.
In the assumption that we are occupied, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without bypassing the punishment or running away from it.
Although the border between ingenuity and law enforcement fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I believe it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way in which the directive was transmitted to provoke them.
The damage to the principles of sport caused by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offer Offensive to capture Christmas dinners from groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
They proliferate self-sustained celebrations by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tourn and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise as an oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which, due to the crisis, have led to an offensive of adjusted prices in order to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, agree the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector interviewed.
To end up complicating accounting, this year's calendar (when Christmas falls on Friday) has concentrated requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (on 16 and 17) and hardly movement for the previous week.
As has already happened since 2008, when the lean cow stage began, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners on budgetary grounds.
In order not to dispense with tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració in Barcelona, Gaiete Farràs.
The employer's representative, today, does not dare to predict what this month's celebrations will look like.
"People think about it a lot before they book."
"He wants to get out but he has the alerts on on the price issue," he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to lower a step with the crisis, so that the strip around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
A survey in various central establishments shows the collapse of petitions by the night of the 17th.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a real boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has brought more advance reservations, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done everything we can to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
At AN Grup, which hosts El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to 23 locations, they remain optimistic after detecting an upsurge in billing since the second semester and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group point out that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who will precede the holidays.
To its six group menus have added one Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a willingness to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green outbreaks in some companies that invite their employees again and feel that the volume of groups is somewhat larger.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts to start to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that overall the reservations are "animated", although the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That's right, the illusion of the festivities hasn't come down, pay whoever pays, it says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is causing great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a rate faster than any other country".
Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department leaked through the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program has in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, rather than increasing, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for unveiling in Washington.
The Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists this in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to Taliban-attacked territory, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferator and motive for keeping guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear installations; given the fall in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry at a meeting with his American counterparts.
The most novel of the documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the ever-lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high rate of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
An office of the embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," says: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of aid remain unanswered or are discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clearly" the person responsible that "the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileaks' boss
Obama appoints a senior anti-terrorist leader to avoid further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to track the movements and locate Assange wherever it is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, it's not new, it's dated November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the last leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creator's lawyer Mark Stephens says that "the police know where and how to get in touch with Mr. Assange."
It was on the 20th when the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at Sweden's request, but did not disclose it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange "with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as the organization has explained, do consider the so-called "free way" network to proceed to an arrest -- which must be committed by the national police force -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the founder of 39-year-old Wikileaks has been willing to respond by video conference to questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also remember that Assange applied for and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of her case, to which they compare with the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the missive denounces.
While the world is looking for him—and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence—Assange remains unknown, but not silent.
On Monday he gave an indeterminate interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering American diplomats to spy at the UN in violation of international treaties that the US has signed, he should resign," he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the resignation request as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has appointed a senior counter-terrorism officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to diminish Assange's importance contrasts with views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will be chairing the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and prosecute anyone who gives them any contribution or help."
Further further has gone Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying that Assange should "be killed."
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Anyone in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," Fox said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winks to the likes of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to bypass the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without north for the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his resignation is insufficient for his associates to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can not at all cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the leader of Esquerra will try to win over the new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to rule on their secret continuity.
By means of ballot papers, not by hand.
If the caroists want to convey a certain vow of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that he would not consider himself ratified by half plus one of the votes, but added, without precise percentages, that neither would a "Bulgarian" result be good.
The next to Carod demand that the president do more than put his office at the disposal of the militia, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercos controls the highest organ between congresses.
But by not having the majority enough to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive on a road map by May.
To this end, they look forward to participating in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document to be put to the vote by the National Council on 18th.
Its intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for him promising to advance the congress in the autumn of 2011, something that the dome already takes for granted.
The leader of ERC acknowledged that "polyphony" harms stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, be able to wash dirty door cloths inwards.
In this line, it is symptomatic of the article Josep Huguet signed in his blog.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovació gave the fact that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five of them, of which two stand out.
The first, to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new faces that come from the sector related to Carod.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate assemblyism at once as an operating mechanism.
He therefore called for a reform of the statutes to enable congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
To end the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard at the last two congresses.
In fact, the conclave convulsion of 2008 left the management with the task of reviewing assemblyism at a specific congress for the reform of statutes.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years was discouraging to deal with the matter.
Now, without sectors critical of stalking, it can be a good time to pick it up and try to shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 executed during 2010
According to the count of MILENIO State of Mexico, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the content of MILENIO State of Mexico.

In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of the colony Playa Golondrina.
Emergency bodies carried out a thorough search for the other members of the body, however they were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán warned of the finding of a corpse in Peña Colorada, which was tied with his hands back and with his head blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his neck.
In the middle of the month two men were reported executed, who were wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda fractionation in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, along with the victims were also discovered two messages of death warnings.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the colony Valle de los Reyes, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.

In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots to the back of the neck, a woman's lifeless body was found in the village of San Francisco Acautla.
In the woman's skin, Santa Muerte tattoos were detected, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the last part of the month, a man's body was found on board a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three gunshots and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a couple of men with their heads wrapped up and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said: "This happens to those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied hands and feet, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them was beheaded in the Ancón knife colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of the Juárez colony.
Next to him the agents found a postcard with a message.
Maintains China's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and said that it supported its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, that country's representative at COP16.
At its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it made clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this regard.
He noted that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building; and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the adoption last year of a new Energy Act, which reflects the objectives set in terms of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, several multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries, are under way or have already been completed.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which had been implemented over the past five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, another for switching incandescent outbreaks by savers, and another for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific advisor to the country's government on climate change, said China's efforts have been greater than is generally thought.
For example, it stated, the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent over the past five years and plans to do so by 2020, it has abounded.
Attached to the legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the NAP explained that the former Panist leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to the legality and that the former Panista leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's taking of protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sound Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal, if necessary, to the Order Commission of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that there was never at the negotiating table an alliance for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that National Action would emerge strengthened from the internal election on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor would be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal," he said.
The Panista leader specified that the PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; the counter "we enjoy it and strengthen us", he said.
He said that no doubt the council will be able to choose the best or the best leader who requires National Action for the next three years, hence he will hand over the sham "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquility and openness, either of the five would be proud to hand over the party president's office."
He predicted that the rerun that the party recorded in the last elections on July 4 will be reflected in the upcoming contests, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a cause for observation throughout the country, hence "a lot of hopes, hopes are placed on them, and I am sure Gabino will live up to expectations".
When questioned about the PRI's criticisms of President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the framework of the four years of his government, Cesar Nava called on the PRI to reflect on the sexiens of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that Zedillo and Salinas' governments were better than Fox and Calderon's, let them start defending them, let them get out of the closet," he said.
He was of the opinion that the head of the federal executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no gag or much less censorship in the country.
Promotes Obama on Twitter law in favor of undocumented students
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation," tweeted the U.S. president on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation," Obama tweeted.
His brief message maintains an open cyber link with a broader document that asks the public to immediately communicate with the senators, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected to take place soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation, unless the extension of Bush era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get a deal sometime at that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would request a "debate closing vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or American Dream Law would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the past five years and have entered a higher education institution or army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require a handful of Republicans to participate, at a time when organizations that support the project are engaged in intense lobbying to ensure the passage of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
That is why supporters of the Dream Act need to add a number of Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martínez's term.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have stated that they will not back it another time.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature put your finger in the sore
The second round of The pleasures of the tongue was a walk where the participants showed the story
"I understand that of The Sex in the Tongue but... the finger in the sore? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the tongue, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another fair the round table dedicated to The Sex in the Tongue, she explained).
The finger in the sore... "it puts us in a hurry," the Argentine writer sweetly spat out to the public, mostly young people, who met at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who, in search of knowing what the "throw" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get answers although clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strong one, perhaps my sore."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who stole his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies that the sore is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the sore is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "of the sore I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must go very far.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative that entitled Praise of the invention, where the finger in the sore is not named but at one point it is discovered.
With strokes of magical realism, a famous sorceress, who was playing clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, a narrative that turned to speak America, the great novel that his own chroniclers did not miss from the beginning and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of what was told by the conquering captains.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) mocked the pretended witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told with imagination that was lacking to the point of indecentness."
However, he highlighted "it is the madmen and the fools who best imagine" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that of the narrated belongs to one side or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
It is actually called the "cervantine tradition."
"By his inheritance we are what is told."
In her turn, writer Mayra Montero narrowed down and applauded the variety of interpretations to which the invitation of the FIL gave rise with her round table The finger in the sore.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed theirs towards the great scourge of social violence that is going through their country - and shares Latin America - as a result of the drug trade and sale disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and reader, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "from that finger in the wound of the writer's committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind each statement there is a small no and behind each denial there is a small yes".
"To be the owner of our thinking and to be the owner of reality we have to mattize: and mattize often means putting our finger on the sore and bothering those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, on established ideas and without nuances and also disturbing the powers that prefer a black and white world," he said, inviting us to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although until now he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up comforting himself with the medal of the sub-champion, he has remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he has played consecutive finals.
The strategist reached his first final as coach at the 2002 Open Tournament, when he was in the reins of the Morelia with which he fell for a total of 4-2 before Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closing he also came to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total of 3-1 and went precisely before Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again in front of the Devils, Rubén again suffered a setback, as his team ended up tied 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the round of penalties he put himself in the lead by 3-1 with two chances to seal the title for finally three his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 flip.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore does not want to run the same fate, seeks to get rid of the evil and to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and as a result the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," the tymmel commented when he questioned him about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very effective has the previous final, from which, he says, he has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the referee whistles the final we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players also, because the previous time, with two penitents to throw we were already prepared to run and I think that is a teaching, until the game is over we can celebrate".
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shootings, something that does not bother you, because you trust your players: "One never seeks to reach the criminal ring, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we made a bad play the fate, sometimes because of the nerves or anxiety of having the title in our hands, but it left us, that left us something for this end that we hope not to reach that instance".
Romano has in his hands to stop being a technical sub-champion and to try for the first time the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules for obtaining visa
Persons are required to attend Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview with the Consular Section; the cost will be lower as well as the waiting time.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and consulates will be changed.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC) prior to their interview with the Consular Section.
The ASC staff shall take the biometric information of the applicant, which shall be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another payment for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases on request (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for commercial and investor visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken in the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this section for less time than in the past.
Likewise, those applying for visas at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

Announcing NASA's Extraterrestrial Life Finding
The U.S. space agency called on the press to present a finding tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will release tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there is extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as being responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
By quoting the press, NASA assured that it will present "a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures at our side and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they would become intelligent beings like humans if they improved the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some ways, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and from this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will make known the true scope of the findings at tomorrow's press conference Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the greatest moon of Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and Opposition 'Block' Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanism', denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the House.
Before starting the session of installation of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tronaban' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it gives rise to 'bipartidism', because now it will be two people, of the same number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the panelist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that these reforms in an institutional way constitute the political marginality of the PRI and NAP.
He explained that in the next few days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overrun again by both parties and with this the opposition coalition has ended.
"So far it has arrived (the opposition coalition), it is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress after having been monopolistic, now be "duopolic".
"It is not the spirit to reform the law that there is eternal bipatidism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking with other colleagues to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that today the Congress became a 'bootin' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're dividing it between two."
Master Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to be given his place at the negotiating tables.
"Let not by cupular agreements, let it be left out to 5 that we are probably going to make 9 deputies, now the five that see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform they made they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200,000 more comes out for "the supplier"
Pay Mazatlan City Hall another check to the questioned owner of electrical equipment company.
One more check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "clearance of accounts payable".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still due and, therefore, how many more checks are missing to be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, you are simply being paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the latter on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Gazette of the State, as the Law states when a company is questioned by the ESA, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not again used its services.
This, after the 25th of July, Northwest published a revision to the cheques issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to 9th of July 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent to attend tourist sites
They regret tourist businessmen accident of the foreign tourist for bad conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in bad condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that they take care of the image of the destination and reverse the bad that tourists encounter with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and the banquets has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and take them back to the nearby businesses.
"Politicians do not know what it is to close a company one day and have no idea of the money being lost, or else they would not do the works in this way in so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist's fall exposed the City Council's lack of prevention and maintenance.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so by giving preventive maintenance and not just falling into corrective action," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, like the Shield and the Mazatlan Venadito.
"Today, for the tourist to come not only depends on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
"No due attention has been paid and this kind of fact highlights something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said it is urgent to rescue tourist sites in Mazatlan, as they are not taken advantage of correctly and project a bad image.
He talked about a number of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city up to date, clean, tidy and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be sorted first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive to be added to the inventory we have to promote to the destination."
Request IP results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A Labour Legislature worthy and free of agreements between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th Legislature, consisting of seven political forces, 19 deputies from the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergence and one from the PVEM, which totals 40 people's representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the State is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partyism or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly released 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that the deputies will actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnaval comrades of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that will bring the Governor forward in turn.
"We make sure that they come to do a decent job and above all committed to society and sectors because it was the Signatories who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotels Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somehow encourage job creation."
As for tourism, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight he holds within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretary.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruent as important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that it directly competes with agro-industry."
In addition to the need to label resources for detonating tourism projects that help to give security to the state and update to the Alcohols Act that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
Looking for a magician king
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the wish of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For his parents, the next King's Day will be difficult to please his illusions, as his home is made up of nothing but 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in the Colonia Salvador Allende and lives a day because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Sometimes we see it hard because my husband doesn't have a chamba, but we sell tangerine and papa... I already go out with the plebes in the afternoon to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, Joseph Alfredo, 10 years old, has long aspired to have a 'monster' car and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothing size for a year.
"He told me (Joseph Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said 'let's see son', because it was very expensive," Cayetana sadly recalled.
For older children, those who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Mary Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while Michael, 8 years old, uses size eight.
José Juan, 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of sizes five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign Seeking a Magic King, donating a toy or cash at the reception in Northwest.
Fourteen alleged drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions were carried out as part of the dismantling of a production and sale network of Cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
The persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
"Some 750 plants of Cannabis, four kilos of hashish, money and production equipment have been seized," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec Security spokesman.
In total, eleven men and three women, including the two alleged network leaders, two Sherbrooke men, have been arrested.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse in the hours following their arrest.
They could face accusations of Cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
"It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to make the arrests," says Mr. Ruel.
This police operation involved around seventy officers from the Estrie investigation module of Quebec Security, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department.
Fighting illegal migration without problems
The Conservative bill, which the Government believes should solve the problem of the pateras loaded with illegal migrants, will surely face a great opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely primarily on the Charter."
"I am here with a party that has created the granite that you tread," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Quebec Block leader, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he would not be able to support the bill because it points to the wrong target.
"We are against and all opposition parties seem to be against the project, so we will see what the government is doing," said Mr Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected from a pen the criticisms that indicate that her party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democratics agree that action should be taken against those in charge of clandestine pateras, and that is what we want with another bill, the C-35," says Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," explains Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this type of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a fluff."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," says Minister Kenney.
The Government had not announced a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a Conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to ask for a vote so that each Member who is going to object would be able to explain himself to his constituents later.
The new unity does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised for two days: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York this issue since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, Tuesday's announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It should be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services in Quebec held on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebec party critic who deals with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of the joke" and "a last-minute slug solution."
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," he says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr Charest persists in avoiding the creation of this committee of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he suggested that Quebec grant a special mandate to the agent general to conduct a survey of collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the general agent's mandate," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent team is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request seems to come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments to this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001 relating to motorcycle groups, although the Penal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
At night, there was another land flow in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Also, between 20 and 40 additional millimeters are expected from now until Thursday evening, depending on the region.
Sectors located north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
As these precipitations add up to the melting of snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and of the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, 10 residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the flooding of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit remains on the alert and monitors the situation closely, according to Annik Bouchard, Security Adviser.
The Quebec Growth Forecast Centre, for its part, issued announcements on Wednesday communicating the strong growth of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partially guilty of Dupont
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as their rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts broadcast during the day".
The Council also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint by the Frente Comuno of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters must report reliable data and not lead to deception.
Regarding suicide, the present Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont le midi" have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Therefore, any fault has been dismissed in this regard.
The last dispute concerned the declarations made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a media confrontation that had sparked numerous reactions.
The presenter of CHOI stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not be sure if the needy were actually going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already completed my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of rude language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio network has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences shall be minimal for the station, which shall, inter alia, announce the decisions once at the highest hearing hours within three days.
Kung-fu King in Montreal
The watchmaker of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai boxing, climbs to the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I seek combat everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and thai boxing," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San shou World Cup in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished among the top four positions in the world's last championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but reached third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been making progress in every competition."
"At this stage, I will be the first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline native to China in which it is allowed to hit with fists and feet, as well as throw adversaries to the ground.
The clashes were originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous fighter in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese Cung Le origin, widely recognized in the martial arts world.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only hold a competition in his career, he will definitely attend the big "King of Sanda" tournament, the kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is China's most notorious and prestigious," explains the friendly boy.
"It's like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).
"It's been an amazing experience."
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"The one who won me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face each other at the end of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without invitation to tender
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in direct contracts to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the centre of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, that of managing the project, for an amount of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy Management consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem which threatens to eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and the elimination of competition."
"I mean, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," said Quebec Party Member Sylvain Simard yesterday at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how to benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there had been a collusion with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, arguing that the QP had acted "unhonestly" and "with lack of rigor."
He pointed out that "the least" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a bid for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the scale of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract had been awarded without competition being involved; it had been negotiated.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the consortium formula in the field of technical advice is being investigated by the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's business register allows you to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy stewardship consortium, Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to a particular labour dynamics and Hydro-Québec responds specifically to it since the 1970s."
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of Société d'Energie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the actors in the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and at a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Energy stewardship consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14, and Dessau 10, regardless of their participation in Energy Stewardship.
All contracts were negotiated.
A total of $449,783,344, including the Energy Stewardship contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec."
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the QP is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is more about their leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer hardly trusts the players in sustainable development, as well as fair trade marks and ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that defend a more responsible consumption pulverize, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even slows down their commitment.
Even if the consumption of products called "socially responsible" has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of the companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of the official certificates that carry so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that bear labels indicating that they are "appropriate", the Barometer points out.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, responsible consumption information seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the gaps and dubious nature of the information mean that 46 per cent of consumers reject this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers also say they are suspicious of the supposed returns of green products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
Sixty-one per cent have given priority to shopping in the shops in their neighbourhood and have preferred to buy food grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points out of a maximum of 100 this year), the Homo consumerus of Quebec loves to occupy the position of the king of recycling who tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social awareness seems to be door (from his car) out: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared cars to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavior survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and walking trips.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after Société Angus and the Parallele, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who were expecting a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy again Daniel Langlois the film complex eXcentris in the boulevard Saint-Laurent and return his true cinematic vocation, have not obtained what they were asking for.
The Government has accepted to be involved in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would, in fact, be below initial expectations; it could be a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million, but since then the applications have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, sent a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent him a last report about a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counterproposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallele and Angus have a deadline until 31 December to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a donation from the State should be completely discarded.
Let us remember that the Association of Owners of Cinemas and Cinematographic Complexes of Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, a number of representatives of the sector do demand considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has been carrying the burden of the author's film on his premises for ten years, after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Treasury Board.
The lack of independent film rooms is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallele, led by Christian Yaccarini, are driving a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to open their way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallele, continues to screen films in eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, screening Xavier Beauvois' precious film "Des hommes et des deeux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not re-contacted Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downside proposals they have received.
It lifts the veil of Canada complexed...
New U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers to be the Canadian complex vis-à-vis the U.S., but at the same time reflect their sense of superiority towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don't think about Canada-U.S. relations when they go to vote and believe President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable of September 22, 2008, that is, during the full federal election campaign, tells how far the United States does not get into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of inferiority practically inherent to Canadians in dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 Free Trade Campaign), " he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to speak of it."
The ambassador has even more problems in understanding this "deaf silence" because the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Of course, he believes, the ability of a candidate, of a party and, even more, of a party leader to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which voters should think about voting."
This feeling of importance can also be seen from the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will record for the first time deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40 billion," writes Mr. Breese.
No mention is made of the fact that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to prevent the replacement of the coalition or the parties of the opposition from making their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication of January 2008 signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington about the increasingly negative image of the drama series broadcast on the United States CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even kidnappings for the CIA to carry out vigorous interrogations.
Another cable reports that, during its first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied that yes, but that it depended "on each case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has given a document to the Secretary of State concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the moods have been heated in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered."
Mike Huckabee is echoed in the United States.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan for the renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by almost one third of the additional reduction to stabilize the climate of the planet by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN hopes will be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of global car fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, large issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should be further reduced in order to stabilise, by 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius in order to prevent it from being out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, energy consumption is further reduced by two times.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
On top of that, they contain no mercury.
A number of specialists have expressed reservations about fluocompact bulbs, as they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluocompact bulbs, but coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is wasted by incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages of this international programme for each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save billions of dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, i.e. the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast looks forward to the announcement of election results
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," said a spokesman for the head of the UN.
"Request all Ivorian parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the deadline from Wednesday to midnight to pass without publication of the results, three days since Sunday's scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the president of the CIS had told the television that the commission "was still working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, requests have multiplied in the world for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, Gbagbo's side is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudful" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the president of Côte d'Ivoire, said that the intimidation of voters carried out by the FN in the north of the country had discouraged the supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be overturned if the Constitutional Council accepts Gbagbo's complaints.
However, Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in the publication of the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential round, on Sunday, should have put the wink into the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivorian political class that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent on continental territory (9.7 per cent taking into account overseas departments), as shown by the seasonally adjusted data (ESC) published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, with 9.3 per cent of the working population on continental territory and 9.7 per cent with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but want to work, whether or not they are available within two weeks to work and whether or not they are looking for employment.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate up to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4 per cent in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, a figure of 6.6 per cent with the DOM.
Unemployment has been stable only among people aged 25-49, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Since 2006, Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and has announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social goods, embezzlement of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, according to her lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions asked by the magistrate, not ghosts."
"It is easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, had told AFP before his client's appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began to investigate and also imprisoned one of their nearby people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing your client has done has been to deal with the landfills he must manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the allocation of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to counsel Simon.
Within the framework of this file, it is also being investigated since Wednesday Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, for embezzlement of funds and complicity, but they have left him on parole and is forbidden to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The investigating magistrate has taken account of the explanations and has released him," explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, four other persons were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of Marseille Provence Métropole's property (MPM), has been accused of "trafficking in influence and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "abduction and misappropriation of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and for "complicity in misappropriation of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "covering the abuse of social goods".
Among the people who have faced Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have a service to whitewash the capital of big banditry.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the research points out that the research focuses especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elisha has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spying", has had the public at large in France, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elisha has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice on managing their own " hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not occur in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and sought by US justice for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the raw reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
Eliseo's advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by Quai d'Orsay's director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, spoke with US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own forcibly detained citizens to Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "continuously release" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "inocence," "immediate liberation."
All to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often still."
Because, once attempts to negotiate through discrete channels have been exhausted, "silence will solve nothing", the Iranians are "experts in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a usual Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail."
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day he takes refuge in the French embassy) "will require the Iranians to be paid a large amount of money" (230,000 euros in reward).
In addition, he notes that Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the close to 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge ' s decision.
The U.S. embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of material for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier guaranteed that it was not.
El Eliseo, he says, "has not only been greatly surprised by the judge's decision," but has tried to oppose it.
"There has been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot annul the decision" judicial, he says.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is still under the "tight" surveillance of the French information services.
Elisha's advisor dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in some buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elisha spares no effort, using communiqués and "fouls" organized in the media to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and verify that manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles convey the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is the reason for such "gratitude" towards Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their words full of praise, French officials recognize in private that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The paper then deals with the reasons that have led the Elisha to give way to this fiction.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he says.
A policy launched in 2008, which "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, had just been branded premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris tries "to show Syria the praises it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also "to sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. embassy knows that from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided in him: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we've thanked him."
"At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elisha.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria who had played an "active role in favour of the liberation of our compatriot".
From midnight on, young Koreans can't play online
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Cinderella" that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight blocking their access, according to government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, as indicated by representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then they find it hard to study at school and live a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the bill.
The online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, precise.
The government also intends to ask companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of the young people so request, added the person responsible.
In addition, it will make available free software to those who request it to limit Internet access time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly provide news about various events related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World 2018-2022: FIFA appoints organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee appointed on Thursday the organizing countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying can come to prevail over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, since the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes transactions, therefore, may last up to the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidatures have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the opportunities of his country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has highlighted three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and embarrass English officials, who have launched intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the head.
The Head of Government hopes to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, which he had achieved in 2005 for London the organization of the JJ.OO. 2012.
This intense activity, will it be enough to regain the brilliance of England before the EC?
It is not clear, since the duo Spain-Portugal also has numerous strengths thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (World of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could bring down their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal the only thing they manage is to give points to Russia, turned into an outsider of weight despite the gaps in their candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced a "unfair competence in the preparation of the vote" in a direct reference to the allegations of the English press against EC members.
"They're bringing out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which had the experience of 1994, seemed to be the most logical favourites.
As the world's leading economic power and home to FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to be taking advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that have jointly organized the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities by 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue to expand to new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be adversely affected by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted it.
Mitterrand had suggested that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One warrant at the Elisha leads to another.
The current Head of State will therefore be re-candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not match well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always be said that it is doubtful.
One way and the other.
In 2006, even if they didn't believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he didn't rule out a third term.
On 15 November, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometimes in autumn 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the UMP Members, on Tuesday night at the Elisha, the possibility of "two terms of office" has caused a stir.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
I was just passing on the facts, not an announcement.
It's not the first time you've talked about the presidents, with a playful tone, in meetings of this kind.
"In the worst, or rather, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I won't ask myself what will come next."
His statements yesterday do not bring him closer to the candidacy, nor less.
They raise comments for two reasons.
Acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has gone up to the lecture that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
On the contrary, the fact that his 2012 candidacy is clear is what leads many people in the PS to demand that the battle be organized ahead of schedule.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the issue," the Prime Minister's environment has reacted immediately and prudently.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the modalities for the exit from the crisis or at least to announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations which should end at the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt emission institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, supported the ECB's active role in helping to resolve the debt crisis in the European states.
He did not mean whether he considered that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its government bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."...
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more eloquent as to his intentions, indicating only that the programme for the purchase of State letters on the secondary market "continue" and that "we will see what we decide" during the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB is going to keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week to around EUR 1.350 million.
Moreover, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday he would have bought Irish and Portuguese securities again.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have acquired securities amounting to EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt at all that purchases will continue (see page 29).
Nor do economists foresee any significant changes in direction.
Although more than three months' lending operations have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on beneficial terms and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I can't imagine you're going to change your program considerably."
"If not, it would run the risk of creating new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive outing announced during the first quarter of 2011," says Sal economist Norbert Bräms.
Oppenheim.
With regard to interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds in order to keep the market stable", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European bank exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in returns paid by the most fragile states," said yesterday an important bond manager.
Because, if interest rates are put in the clouds, States will have even more problems in reducing their indebtedness, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi heads the temporal
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the decline of bond rates to 10 years.
A recovery from precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indescribable" and expected a "unpredictable" weekend, statements later denied by the person concerned.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record 210 basis points and the price of the bankruptcy risk coverage contracts (CRQ) had been triggered up to 263 points, causing a certain stir in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, expressed "deep concern" about "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts have meant a jar of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the budget under consideration in the Senate is based on 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3 per cent of GDP next year (compared to 3.9 per cent planned by the government) and 3.5 per cent in 2012 (instead of 2.7 per cent).
Hence the rumour that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be adopted," says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of his economy are in order and his accounts are in good order, as we have been saying for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2 per cent of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are smaller than those required from other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period of time would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated this yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that we have already shown on Sunday, at night and by day, that Europeans are clearly solidarity, determined, committed to the defence of their currency and their currency zone."
Although it was relative, yesterday's relaxation in the types of European States' obligations has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a principle of normalisation.
Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most common target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs heavily on banking systems," said economists from Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the political pace is much slower than the pace of markets."
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the mechanisms for exiting the existing crisis.
Informal consultations between finance ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
This also takes into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional support measures for euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about the latest developments in the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issues of EFSF securities are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official confided to the Reuters agency that the U.S. would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As regards the countries on the front line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path from that followed by Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid, at all costs, seeking international aid before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they consider indispensable to build confidence in a lasting way.
Finally, the capitalist partners of European funds are considering the options available to speed up the process of normalising public bond markets.
By way of Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 75 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider that an amount of around EUR 100 billion more would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently has EUR 60 billion.
A council that could certainly examine the European capitals in detail.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowfalls continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are currently on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Meteo France, the heavy snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on the island of France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm are expected, from 7 to 10 cm, in the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Lower Normandy, Isla de France and Lemosín.
Snows are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
According to the gendarmes, the movement on the secondary network in Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that it not be conducted except in case of necessity and that the movement of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
On Thursday, school transport in Picardy has been banned.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "enjoys all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25 per cent of their flights at Roissy Paris airport on Thursday and 10 per cent in Orly due to the anticipated snowfall.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: First Financial Drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport on the island of France has reached its peak, billions are raining.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro that must be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State has announced a funding allocation of €4 billion.
On the theoretical level, this sum will be the sum which will subsequently allow the GSP to obtain loans on the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 law on amending finance, discussed in the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase of the tax on offices on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The proceeds of this tax are 117 million euros per year".
The second is a modification of an office tax that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would be obtained with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it's far from 4 billion.
"It is specified that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the allocation of funds that the State will mobilize and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses", we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as explained."
"It shall be recorded in the budget and used according to needs".
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving the $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised $4 billion is not included in the credit, can lead to a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Avenger hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks issue has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous at the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's sinisterly ridiculous profile has long given ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or don't know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I know, libération editor), who only considers what he can recognize true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the US embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same that the Newsweek published the previous week.
Then why have the revelations of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that the embassies, at least since the Second World War and since the heads of States can call themselves by phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have become spy centres.
Any spectator who sees research films knows it perfectly well, we just seem to know that we don't know it because of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker could consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "problems".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, he could be conceived of as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer keep its own secrets stand?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but revealing, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means taking away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any confidential information on the network, as it would be like publishing it on a street sign.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, you cannot expect to keep conversations confidential over the telephone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a Head of State has flown and contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my prediction is a science fiction and, therefore, novel, but I imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligence with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at best, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
That information is then stored in a single copy in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, that is, backward.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a telegraph with cables (telephones).
Video tapes (analogues) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backwards, discovering all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (digitals) only allow to move forward or backwards from chapter to chapter, i.e. to huge proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the journeys that it entails, we need three and a half hours.
It is therefore nothing out of the ordinary for communication policy and techniques to take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was secretly planned in the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: France's Bubbles in its Funding Promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unlocked funding pledges (called fast start or early start) made by developed countries have been met.
And the French doves have been revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.260 million (i.e. €420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was appreciable and appreciated for what is really worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, placing it on the right path towards fulfilling its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without harming official development assistance.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has taken the year 2009 as its reference: international funding is maintained and 150 million more are added over three years as fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references to the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to expenditure in previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), while it seeks to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element is the distribution of grants and loans.
Once again, there is no standard and everyone chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider each euro loan to be equivalent to a donated euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to emission reduction that are based on more efficient technologies), it is deceptive to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... At most, only the cost of the loan for the country that grants the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be calculated for its commitments.
But France finds no such reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% of loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million); consult the EU document to see it for itself.
This is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it at 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to fulfil its commitment, France contributes only ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
A good trick!
In short, France, in its fast start financing, makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending just EUR 36.1 million, he manages to give the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early financing is a relatively short-term detail in relation to all climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it doesn't.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could make progress in the discussions on the stakes at stake in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional nature" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is on other issues.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of the "additional nature" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to advance the negotiations.
Warning on pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy eats 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Generations Futures association (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem addressed", acquired from supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September foods that usually consume a child of about ten years of age in four meals and one snack a day.
These meals, taken as a model, which comply with official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as candy, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as potential or probable carcinogens and five substances are classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic pollutants and/or PE is worrying," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain by themselves more than a dozen possible carcinogen residues and three considered as safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in the food, where the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian fillet, canned tuna and even the bread bar or gum were prepared with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analysis found the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutritive" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk that these "pollutant cocktails" generate for the consumer is "probably underestimated," says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "against the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase of diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
