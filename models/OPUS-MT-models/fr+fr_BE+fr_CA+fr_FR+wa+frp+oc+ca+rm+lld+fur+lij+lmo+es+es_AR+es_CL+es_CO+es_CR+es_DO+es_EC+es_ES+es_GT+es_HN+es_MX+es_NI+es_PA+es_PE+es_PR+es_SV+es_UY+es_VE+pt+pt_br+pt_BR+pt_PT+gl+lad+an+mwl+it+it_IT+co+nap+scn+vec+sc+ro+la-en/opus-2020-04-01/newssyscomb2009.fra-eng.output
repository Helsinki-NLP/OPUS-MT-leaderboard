Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have a total of 29 percent
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria led to a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current major coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered from particularly large losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphal return to the national political scene.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 percent of the vote, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the vote.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 per cent lost almost nine per cent of the votes, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the popular party, which launched the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable advance on the SPÖ.
However, voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations were made about the possible resignation of the party leader and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, during the extraordinary leadership council of the party.
Such an evolution would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the election, which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the large SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 per cent and BZÖ 11 per cent of the votes - the Socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separated from it) on a common government, which even raised sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to work with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently relies on this evolution.
The last party to have access to the parliament being the Greens, but they slightly lost and fell, among the Austrian political parties, from the third to the fifth.
Obviously, no other party crossed the four-per-cent limit and entered parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India at Risk of Cooling
If the problem of Czech researchers accused in India of illegally collecting cockroaches could not be resolved, a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations would follow, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
The minister declared it today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he observed after the meeting, carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the talks, that the executive branch could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was discharged from the charge and punished by a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of the Darjeling, the case being placed under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could request bail and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed, that his partner expressed himself in the same direction also during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support", mentioned the Indian Minister.
He also said that such assistance was already being provided to them by India.
"We want above all to keep with India the best relations, which have a tradition continuing over many years.
The Indians also recognize it," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We regard the imprisonment and accusation of these Czech researchers as a great contempt," he said.
The minister shunned the question whether he had obtained a promise from India to deal with the matter.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he said.
A Czech Arbitrator Fights for the Seabed
It approaches a wall electronic map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
Yet this area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian jurist Luigi Santosuossi, who is part of the team of thirty members of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the division director, Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
Ardour at work and enthusiasm characterize the reigning atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world little known to date, rich in natural resources.
There are oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms that are currently unknown, which may contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A background larger than the mainland
The Litoral States have now begun to vehemently aspire to the new submarine territories.
According to a United Nations convention, they do indeed use their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In order to simplify, the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered as a continental shelf.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the said exclusive economic yone," explains Mikulka.
The request made by the country concerned to the Commission for the establishment of the outer borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many costly explorations and matrices.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the committee with legal and scientific and technical assistance.
So far, the Commission has dealt with five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
At the moment, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," adds Mikulka.
Australia's success, the first to have significantly expanded its underwater possessions, has recently experienced a global impact.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, attributed to it by the Commission last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometres, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefit they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they expect, be invaluable.
Progressively, other countries will, in turn, submit their demands.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the zone of the ocean bottom, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no state has an exclusive position anymore.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"However, we are not wrong, the seabed is not a Klondike," he said, exaggerating Director Mikulka, stating that "its areas are precisely defined and their regime anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the "Interoceanmetal" joint organisation.
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states, it obtained the status of the so-called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area of the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is stirred there, it is a sort of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract on an extent with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," enumerates Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, brings an example of such a realization.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The German Special Forces were on site for the liberation of the hostages
The Egyptian government had sought Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready but they never took action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are revealed.
According to information from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German Special Forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both Federal Army specialists and GSG 9 officials from the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as Technischen Hilfwerk logistics experts, were at the site of the release.
As the spokesman for the Ministries informed him on Monday evening, the German forces were finally not required, as hostage-takers had released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted Germany's assistance to integrate it on the ground as a support force.
"Unfortunately, this has not happened so far," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had abducted in southern Egypt the group of tourists made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transbashed into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostage-takers has so far remained vague, as has the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have in the meantime arrived in Cairo safely.
Steinmeier stated that the released hostages were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin at the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five vacationers and special forces should have taken off on an Air Force Airbus and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Refuses Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress failed by little the $700 billion heavy financial market bailout plan.
The Dow Jones was sinking into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the bailout plan for the government's financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was supposed to stem the chaos of the financial markets did not get a majority.
In a dramatic move, supporters had desperately tried to convince opponents of the soundness of this $700 billion heavy plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called on MEPs to vote in favour, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for the avoidance of something that has not yet happened," he conceded.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the investor's concern that the state rescue plan could overturn.
It went back a short time before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts are now planning for further serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, approval and approval by the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are necessary.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the next few months according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, Germany's thirst for travel remains insatiable according to this study.
With regard to reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) entrusted to Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing numbers of bookings already dominate the fall months.
Thus the sales figure would have risen to about 11 percent compared to 2007, entrusted the DRV.
The sources of these results are the figures of the GfK, which analyses monthly the booking data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel reservations made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Because of the low price of the dollar, travel to the US would be particularly requested, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about a Third party.
Besides that, Spain, Turkey and Greece and our country would be destinations particularly sought after by the Germans.
Specially organized trips are highly requested, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs here would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individually organised trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with early booking discounts or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also highly retained so that an increase in sales figures will be recorded again compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip declined compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
Ballermann's or Après-Ski hits continuously, beer in pints per litre and celebrities in designer Tyrolean costumes.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is a blonde, television host and wears a tailor-made Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes to the beer party, and already photographers throw themselves at us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in Therese Square, everything is half the worse.
Each or almost wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one looks blasphemed or embarrassed - it's completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume picks up a few strange eyelashes at the banana-choco stand.
A Bavarian woman points out that I would have wrongly tied my apron: "left means free, in the virgin middle, on the house right, in the widow's back."
Discreetly, I tweak my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she tells me and laughs.
Others do not give themselves as much harm for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which it is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us their bare back-train without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first time at the beer party.
He thinks it's "gorgeous," with a "oooo" lying down.
He's telling me all this after he's relieved himself of the glass he's had before.
Right next to that fire hydrant that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those notorious "wild fishers."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol that way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, rabbles of rescuers run on the place of the feast and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses rather intervene in packs - always by four, they drag their stretcher covered with tents in tents.
That's how it works for most of the beer party visitors: we go empty, we come back full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the drunk under the tarpaulin are not visible.
"They're the ones who can't swallow anything anymore," one of the rescuers yells at me in response to my question and then disappears into the mix.
Accident victim identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon in the city on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He's been released since, on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey planned to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, 20 steps from Asia, is one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation tower at each of its angles, like some German provincial townships.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is ruined.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no more doubt as to the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retard in the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as has the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and the forces of the empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say this is a sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen to ruin, swallowed up in the meanders of history.
But today, the rail crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to highlight the enlargement of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a bed-car towards the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit the Turkish MP AKP Suat Kinikioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a journey of 10 and a half hours, shaken on noisy rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots is an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and particularly in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically made of stones and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping centres and numerous pastry shops where middle managers in costume-tie-men and women- meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie, and he even has a Black Berry.
" the aim of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey was cut off from its hind country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case with each other.
She had to do both.
"but, at some point, I asked if" Turkey should choose?"
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out one aspect that almost everyone I was able to talk to, recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway does not only go to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, it is therefore, as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe that is travelling metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another sleepless night, I thought about these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been named "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no longer any doubt on the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memories of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was to include those under 21 years old, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old - refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music presented to it, whether Madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod told us to "let music speak for itself."
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there in the music.
So sing!"
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me- and sometimes they've even inspired me.
Tod Handley held such a rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "focus only on certain people".
A lot of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary by William Woodruff (died 25 September) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford and became a member of Houblon-Norma research in 1950 while he was doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD".
This is what came from Woodruff's author's letter in Beyond Nab End, but this is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time finished a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Houblon, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to conceal this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino, Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino " Flamenco and life " because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magic moments."
Second assault on Honda's super sales
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
To this is added some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more gasoline.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
So it's the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz presents a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation market.
First of all it is observed that Honda has renovated this model within a shorter time frame than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less well known, this model is a sales phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz has been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less a million cars sold in six years represents is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand sold 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it thought it would sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The leaders of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to compensate for much of the drop in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand hopes to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% decrease in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to achieve a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid with a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year around the world.
Depending on the markets and the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 meters (five centimetres more), its width is 1.69 meters (two centimetres more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimetres.
On the other hand, the height does not change by 1.52 meters.
The dimensions are increasing and the interior space is also increasing.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a gas reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity than the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the box of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or panoramic roof - is improving access to rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, starting from the back doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new to this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two petrol propellants of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines have i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2 litre engine develops a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm torque at 4,900 rpm.
This propellant - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propellant, which on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This 100 horse Honda Jazz 1.4L has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the theft of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Centre made this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C represents the development of the Nissan security shield.
This robot will allow branded vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval shape that looks a lot like the Nissan security shield.
But the most important thing is the eyes composed of the bee, able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles within a distance of two metres and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor immediately to avoid the obstacle.
"When it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bifurcating its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Moving Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions such as bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotational function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
" Every second this device should only process information and act on it.
It does not need to keep the information or intuitive logics of previous maneuvers, which is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory or even megabytes."
This represents the first development of new technologies for the instantaneous prevention of collisions, a technology that will be introduced in standard cars in about ten years according to Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be recognized that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without genius.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That's 'The Hotel of Bad Credits'... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Hotel Master leads us to think several times if this is the right time to ask for a loan.
And most importantly, where to do it.
It is sure that this game gives useful information but little detail.
It's more of a game for teenagers.
What if the game is over?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will spend nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new one welcomed by a sharp drop in its stock exchange price.
One week after unveiling an interim agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common shares at a unit price of $25.25, a total amount of $3 billion.
The price chosen is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities that will provide it with a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley indicated that the overall transaction would be conducted on the basis of an average unit price of $29, or 28% above its current price.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% to $23.77 around 5:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status," explained John Mack, the general manager of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but bring it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago," Toshihide Mizuno, the Executive Director of MUFG, told Tokyo, "we thought that participation would consist entirely of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay Morgan Stanley 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into common shares if the latter exchange more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at approximately $47, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
However, a group spokesman refused to elaborate on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has indicated that he has "reduced" his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which saw its stock exchange price melt by half while the cost of insurance against a risk of default on its debt was flying away.
This cost was on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the buy-back of Merrill Lynch, announced that it raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Recast the republic around the socialism of the twenty-first century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, he was the third to vote on a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a large "yes" victory, between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly", he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place calmly according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), focused on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the State over the economy, reserving to it the "planning of development" of a country living mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies sent by its emigrants.
Brought by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, who will be able to carry out up to two consecutive terms of four years and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it will use this power and fight for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back this Monday afternoon safe and sound in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived at approximately 3:30 p.m. on a special plane at the al-Maza military base, located at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, aboard helicopters to Maadi Hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examination.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers," Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on 19 September during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been swept from one cache to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer reported that 30 Special Forces personnel, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the attack in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of fire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fleeing," said the official who requested anonymity.
He reported that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "light" unit had been sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men in the secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The previous day, the Sudanese army claimed that it had intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on which the kidnappers were on board, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unit Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is headlined and is taking place in the current election campaign.
Good.
But a sector of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the amounts of misery that are granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are starving?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only castle in Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with three private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers throw their bulldozers at our forgotten old stones and cemeteries.
When, a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalising it. The three countries support this financial and insurance institution with interest in Hungary in the amount of EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this matter, also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been intensifying for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of Fortis Bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, the three states will buy almost half (at 49%) of the bank's capital in each country.
The bank is undoubtedly going to sell part of its holdings, among which, in the first place, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch organisation ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares began a dizzying fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too large to let it go bankrupt.
Only Friday, the company's shares fell by 12 percent, to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, shares have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the present value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the company's managers, is not realistic.
The company's management accuses the uncertainty of overseas, in relation to the adoption of the US $700 billion rescue plan, to be the cause of the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already received a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new Director General.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's customer circle and no agency was stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also bought leasing companies.
A fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes which link the use of information concerning the prescription of medicinal products, in all cases, to the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it means entrusting his henhouse to a fox" - recalled Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescriptions for drugs, at the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make insurance premiums and capital insured in the event of damage, the health status of the client present, and if they feel that the risk is too great, they do not even ensure it.
In the past, they sent candidates for a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after they learned of the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, it is readily available from pharmacies, data on the purchase of the person's drugs in the past eighteen months. From this, the program itself determines, what disease the person suffers from and what his or her health is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which puts it immediately in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some determine at the same time a risk coefficient, so there is not much left to do to the insurer other than paperwork. However, tiny problems may still arise.
Some of the disadvantages of this program include the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or heat flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers to be an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data, and they must apply to the patient for authorization before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their past failures.
Recently, some companies have also been processing laboratory analysis results and linking them with data on drug use, and in this way, they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the patient's health.
More and more companies have access to data, and the control of use is becoming more and more difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the extension of the control circle of authorities concerning companies specialized in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his programme, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent or not, since if he or she refuses, the insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
So, in the end, hens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are increasing their trade by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other problems, largely global.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit, where cooperation in the field of atomic energy will be the main issue.
The European Union recognizes that India is a great emerging democratic power that should be given a broader right of speech in international affairs, but member countries have not yet managed to agree on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not dwell too much on this issue yesterday at this 9th summit in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would increase trade by two, which means an increase of about 100 billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be a too ambitious target.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civil flights, which will also allow air trade to flourish in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and New Delhi, which ranks ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation had been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on that subject had been mentioned.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic materials by at least twenty per cent until 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the need for a global market at the climate conference next year, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State is now going to the French capital, where, at a bilateral meeting, he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The International Book Fair in Frankfurt awaits for this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Salon with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition, and Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, during the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Papillon: in fact, Italy will be present institutionally, with a Point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by an appointment with the press in the Struktur Room, at the Butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign books of authors is gradually decreasing compared to the total Italian production, and in particular, compared to that for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire missing a year ago.
The wreck of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying in the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau 3000 metres above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County sheriff John Anderson oversaw the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it is the one on which Steve Fosset was traveling the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on or around the plane.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreckage, a team of investigators sent to the scene, identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal belongings were found by a couple around their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, silver species and a sweater.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
By the sixth attempt, he had become in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had travelled around the world by plane and without stopovers.
Among all these records, also that of having stolen at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you're not expecting.
An unusual 4x4 of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, large surfaces and sharp angles.
In short, Glk, the last born of the off road "compacts" of the star's house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Precisely because of its out-of-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, starting on October 17.
Thus, the publicity beating that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the heart of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, we will have the impression that by looking at the image, the car exits the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative technology Eliminator8, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to attract the interest of future buyers? We will see well.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created big problems.
Nor had he ever encountered the opposing typhose.
The extraction of the group is to the right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not really) of Campania and Puglia were added.
They had tricolor flags on which their original city appeared: Saturday night, they were all taken away so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by the English typhose.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhose of real Nazis, that of Levski.
Figc had made available the Italian fans, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had all controlled them: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian typos who had a history of stage crime, did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal waits to read the actions that will come from the Bulgarian police, and then take measures: in this case, it may be that the typhose arrested or identified in the disorders purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that forbids to frequent Italian, but also European, stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now is the time for fear-emulation: that is to say, others may be added to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must extinguish this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," says the Viminal.
So, "keep your eyes open especially in view of Wednesday's national team match in Lecce"
In Puglia there is indeed a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is to say the secret services, which deal precisely with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched out during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a prefect in Trieste, where there is a core supporter of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 typhosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the No. 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the Country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in line, now we will see what has happened, and we will assess for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles against Mameli's anthem: these too are not crimes, but if you will allow me, they are not polite..."
