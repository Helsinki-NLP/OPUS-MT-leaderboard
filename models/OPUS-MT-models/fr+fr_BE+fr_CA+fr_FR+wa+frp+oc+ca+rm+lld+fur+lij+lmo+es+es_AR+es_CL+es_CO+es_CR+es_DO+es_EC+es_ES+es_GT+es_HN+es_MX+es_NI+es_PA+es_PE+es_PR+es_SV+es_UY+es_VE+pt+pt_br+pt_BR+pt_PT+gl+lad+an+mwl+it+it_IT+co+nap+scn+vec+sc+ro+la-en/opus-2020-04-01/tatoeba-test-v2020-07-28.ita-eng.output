Looks like there's no way out.
We fell asleep.

Why should we help you?
I put the plan into practice.
He made a list.
For a while I was really addicted to Coca-Cola, and I drank it every day.

Can I see this?
He can speak Japanese.
I might be wrong.
You're afraid to sleep, aren't you?

Correct the underlined words.
Did you tell him you were kidding?
Keep looking.
When the results are made public, I'll let you know.
I wanted to go back to your village.
Tom is pleased with his success.
You're reliable.
I didn't even consider it.
It's better to have friends in the square than money in the cash register.
You can only smoke on the terrace.
I agree with 100%.
These flowers besides being beautiful also have a good scent.
He's in college now, isn't he?
We should call him.
It's interesting how it happened.
You should remember that.
Tom said he likes to teach French.
He pulled a coin out of his pocket.
Are you related to her?
Who broke this window?
I'll go tell them.
If you heard him speak French, you'd trade him for a Frenchman.
He came ten minutes later.
We waited for him yesterday.
Tom said Mary was low.
Where's the exit?
If I remember correctly, Tom sold his car to Mary for just $500.
I'll call you after lunch.
We didn't agree on anything!
It's very unlikely.
No doctor can explain it.
I have to try it.
You're depressed.
You're wasting my time.
Aren't you Mary's husband?
It was all your imagination.

What do you think of the new teacher?
If actions are stronger than words, why is the pen stronger than the sword?
She bought a tea service.
We're all gonna die.
Tom kept crying.
I can't do it yet.
George was out of his mind from anger!
You misled me.

I forgot everything about them.
He doesn't use it.
I'm disordered.

Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe you should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
Make a move, guys.
I like your painting.
I waited an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom is so sad.
I want to share this with you.
I study at Hyogo University.
We'll take part in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life went smoothly.
Nobody wants to help us.

He's from Sweden.
He didn't have the money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?

I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't that funny, Tom?

That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?

Don't break my heart.
I don't have any plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We had fun.
It's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got angry.
I'm already old.
I have a dirty criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
I bought a book in English from a bookstore.
I'm going to the bookstore tomorrow to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What's your favorite historical movie?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
All of you, go.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I'm being followed.
Don't say things like that.
Worse and worse!

Stop babbling.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I understood that as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
You're good at this game, aren't you?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
Doesn't sound too surprised.
I don't go to school on Saturdays.

I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
You don't want a job?

Can he write Braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I caught him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Step forward.
You need to get more active.
Tom and Mary are joking?
She broke out of the smoke.
I don't have any alternatives.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than he is.
What will this summer do?
He got irritated.
Can you speak Shanghaiese?
It narrowed down because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much has he been paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
Am I in London?
You're still there with her, aren't you?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a great appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
What's your favorite rapper woman?
Say hello to Tom for me.
It's nice to see you so happy.
I usually swim in summer.
Why is he leaving early?
I'm pretty proud of it.

Here's his picture.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom is lucky.
Give me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a convention.
There's no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for the lesson.
He's a little overweight, isn't he?
Who's the man who's playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all his income drinking.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see you.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what am I supposed to tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Are you playing any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom picked her up.
I don't have feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
She convinced the teacher.
When's your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unresolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
It's snowing today.

I can't raise our son on my own.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich Boston girl.
I forgot whether you drink wine or not.
Who tipped them off?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50 grand for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to be in the hotel.
I didn't grow up that way.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated her.
I shave almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer night.
I walk all the time.
It's decisive.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He looked in his bag for the car keys.
I really don't want to talk.
So it must be Argentinian.
I really like my job.
I'd suggest you be more careful.
She's shaken.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom is dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
No one wants to help you.

Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.

You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.

Fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
Do you think Tom killed Mary?
How come you don't have anything to say?
You scoundrels!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue shut.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than I am.
When can I get out of here?
You're early again.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.

How's your summer vacation going?
I don't like poker at all.
How's your job search going?
I heard Tom was killed.
I was ready to do it.
Tom is silly.
Mike came back from the library at five.
I didn't vote for Tom.
He was seen crossing the road.
I'm like my brother.

Do you really think that's necessary?
All who came on the road were surprised.
Who?
Write your name here.
It's very selfish, isn't it?
I could try.
He got lost walking through the woods.
How long will you stay?

Do you still collect stamps?
It's not for them.

The report was soon known throughout the country.
I love your daughter.
Are you bored like me?

What kind of beer does he have?
We're used to living in a big city.
They're our dearest friends.
In general, Japan's climate is mild.

There's no one here.
You should apologize to them.
I'd like to buy a dog.
Layla wondered where Sami was.
Take Tom out.
I was happy at the time.
I told him I'm not hungry.

They said they're embarrassed.
Please take them.
Please come home.
I like professional struggle.
Tom is scabby.
Don't be so formal, please!
Do you think that's a clue?

He does everything very quickly.

You're a moralist.
It's always been a hot head.
She likes beans.
I'm having trouble falling asleep.
The relief is instantaneous.

She's jealous.
Right, I understand what you mean.
You'll be safe here.
Are you proud of your father?
Tom is drunk.
You've already been to Berlin.
You're too young to be in love.
Stay awake.
Where did Tom put my passport?
Now lie down.
He finally decided to get married.
Can I use your phone?
Can't we do anything?

I'm here to help you.
He was too drunk to drive home.
I've heard rumors.
I respected Tom.
So what happened next?
You're ready now.
Go play with him.
Now go brush your teeth.
I can't fire them.
He had a fit of anger.
Don't make any noise while you're eating soup.
Please go to the supermarket and buy some fruit.
I realized I wasn't ready.

I'll give it to you right away.
He said he wasn't interested.
What does the note say?
I don't have to report to you on my actions.
Mr. Gomez didn't apologize for my mistake.

He lives here all by himself.
She convinced me.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
You kissed him, didn't you?
Why isn't Tom here today?
That should be interesting.
He moved west to Nashville, Tennessee.
I'll call you back later.
Where do you want to go?
Tom knows exactly how Mary feels.
Have you ever heard Tom sing?
Didn't Tom tell you?
She misled me.

Tom has a job.
How dare you talk to me like that!
Tell him to leave.
I really like autumn the most.

The good news is that we will be able to help you.
I usually take a bath before bedtime.
What I want is a word processor.
What brought you to Boston?
Do I bother you sometimes?
You want me to leave now?
We're outraged.
I hope you've had a great day!
I'm feeling stressed.
Mary scolded.
We all wanted revenge.
Tom will never agree.
I'm diligent.
I'm sure they're talking about us.
I'm lucky today.
He looks like a baboon.
"Do you have a dog?" "No."
He's got a strange temper.
Have faith in God.
Promise me you'll help them.

He's so lazy.
Help Tom study.

You don't have a wife, do you?
It was sudden.
Just use mine for now.

Don't say stupid things!
Give them the keys.
Could you tell me how to get to the station?
It's already good.

Is Tom busy?
He could die.
It depends too much on him.

Forget about him.
You're different.

I forgot his address.
Were you in love with them?
Hey, did you hear that?
Tom went to France two months ago.
I'm pretty weak right now.

Never trust Tom.
I don't look like Tom at all.
Our work never ends.

Tom never apologized for what he did to us.
What method did you use to quit smoking?
The Morales are in the room.
We went to the beach.
I think they'll be late.
Tom is annoyed.
You shouldn't listen to me.
It doesn't change anything.
You don't have to change.
Oh, look, they're kissing!
I would have wanted him to attend the conference.
Tom was taken to the emergency room.
I have a question to ask you.
Tom called at 2:30.
I live in Osaka.
I'm a doctor, Jim, not a lawyer.
I'm keeping this place for you.
Tom didn't know who Mary was.
I won't find a late girl.
Today's a good time.
It didn't matter to anyone.
You're from Urumqi?
Let me take you to the hospital.
We love what we do.
Together everything is possible!
I want you to be better.
He didn't come back.
You'd better go help them.
He ordered him not to give orders.
I think Tom is in trouble.
I'd like you to go with him.
Have you been to Cairo?
She's got to be out.
I'm not worried about you.
What do you want to do for work?
We want to meet him.
Do you like songs?
Do you really think Tom is honest?
I'll get married soon.
They added a woman to the committee.

Are you always busy?
Did he tell you what to do?
Don't fuck with her!
How long have you lived in Kobe?
How much do you like your new job?

Sami doesn't celebrate Halloween.
You'll never see them again.
I tried to contact him.
She made room for an elderly woman on a bus.
What are you doing here?
It's a delicate problem.
I went to see a movie with Tom after work.
He'll always be there.
I'm trying to avoid them.
No one can understand.
I'm getting weak!
He's pretty overweight, isn't he?
I never believed him.
I'm not his angel anymore.
Tom probably won't be shy.
He's going to recite the poems.
She locked a door.
I don't want Tom to do it here.
I'm in Rome.
Tom gave Mary a Christmas gift.
I can tell you're angry.
You died yesterday afternoon.
Were you blindfolded?
We're getting help.
This guy tried to kill me.
We arrived in New York at night.
Why did Tom kiss Mary?
Come on, don't be silly.
It's a little late for that, don't you think?
I shouldn't have trusted her.
They all knew you.
Why did you sign the confession?
I know Tom is guilty.
You only have two options.
He seems surprised.
I'll ask around.
I don't remember anything.
Tom speaks French perfectly.
He bought some bread.
Tom started working immediately.
Do you like this flower?
Do you know Mr. Jackson?
I didn't have to stay.
Tom is trying to repair his car.
Do you think Tom is still up?
Why are you giving Tom money?
It could be better.
He really hates that way of thinking.
He doesn't associate with them.
I speak French.
Here's an even better idea.
We're all done here.
For now, I don't have a plan.
He calls him a lot.
She's a musicologist.
Why do you give Tom money?
Kids know that, too.
Mary prepared breakfast for her husband.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
We should have tried harder.
Which one is yours?
I just changed my mind.
I said I was hungry.
I didn't read any of those books.
Liisa was tired of the noise.
Tom was in the garden.
It's permalink, isn't it?
Can I get your glasses?
Are you sure Tom won't be angry?
Tom will call the cops.
Please fill the forehead.
Tom forgot his umbrella again.
Do you have a cell phone?
I think he's honest.
Don't push the light.
They still live with their parents.
Who doesn't like that?
They used the serum of truth.
You're authorized to do that.
I didn't know what to say.
I'm feeling really good.
Give me some.
This is Tony.
He's rich, but he's pathetic.
Read the book out loud.
I think I'll go get them.
Where did you exchange them?
I asked Tom and Mary their keys.
He said he'd call me.
He never had a screwdriver in his hand.
I managed to save them.
Do you think Tom is guilty?
Why would we want to punish you?
We're not disappointed.
Your calligraphy is unreadable.
Do you like Tom's tattoos?
Do you have any books on Armenia?
He's as busy as ever.
He called his lawyer.
Are you drunk?
Tom seemed stunned.
I'm tired of singing.
Tom won't buy a new car.
Do you love her?
Tell her we're busy.
Is Tom around?
I need to talk to him now.
I can't see them.
No one will know.
Do you want to do business or not?
He asked for a beer.
