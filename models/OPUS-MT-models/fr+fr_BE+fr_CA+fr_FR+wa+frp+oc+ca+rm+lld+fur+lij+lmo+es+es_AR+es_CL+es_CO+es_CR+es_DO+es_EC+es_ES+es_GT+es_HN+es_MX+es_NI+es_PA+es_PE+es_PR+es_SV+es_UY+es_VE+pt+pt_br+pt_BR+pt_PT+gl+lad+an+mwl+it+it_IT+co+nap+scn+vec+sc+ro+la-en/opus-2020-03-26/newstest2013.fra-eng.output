A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers it a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have only identified 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It was in this spirit that a majority of American governments enacted new laws starting in 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This has increased since the November 2010 elections, adding 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.
Accordingly, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day, and withdraw citizens with a judicial record from their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first State to make such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity card.
However, it often costs more than $100 to obtain the required ID card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID card.
Much more.
Students, voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote the cards issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican legislators sponsored legislation abolishing voter registration on election day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 brought the registration rate of new voters down by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were Afro-Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state's voters.
The same was true of the Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, white voters who formed 76% of voters accounted for only 46% of voters voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The United States Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as an obvious objective to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes show wrong results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men who are already reluctant to pass screening tests even more hesitating?
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and to have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
This study also demonstrated, with follow-up after 12 years, that there are between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if not detected.
I therefore recommend testing from 50 years, or from 40 years if we have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
We really need to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the options possible, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and by opting, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be suggested to be actively monitored and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
Increasingly, the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are being determined with precision.
So I still recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine if we should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pro and cons of the APS test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of their suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one else smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several are also totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Cigarettes are related to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This is a major threat to people's health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after cigarette cessation, the risk of dying of cancer falls by half.
Weight
Pregnancy and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer," he adds.
Food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of having colorectal cancer.
Charcuterie too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may result in the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also unclear.
Mr. Beaulieu also stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"To pass a screening test, it doesn't give cancer."
Higgs boson decorated
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs' boson created a whole stir last summer and for cause.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, just that.
And then, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it is much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly certain.
Let's just assume it's the Higgs, because the odds of being wrong seem thin, and let's see what this is about.
There is, in this lower world, a fatally unavoidable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you'll hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has such a law: Pauli's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting grossly in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens named Fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And in the other are the bosons, a dirty gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, moreover) The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs boson would in some way be related.
These bosons, it must be emphasized here, are not all beasts as exotic as we might believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disadvantages" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a bit like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disadvantage" is born an electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "power bearers".
More stable field
The same goes for Higgs' boson, which is the difference between it being another field, the Higgs field, which has to be "dangered" for this boson to appear.
However, this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it must be reached with very, very high energies, somewhat as if it were a frozen pond whose only a very big rock could ride the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and the mass.
It is not all particles, nor all materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, it is not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (such as photon, hold) do not have.
Now, what can you "bring" all this research, ask Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to look at any differences between the observations and predictions of the MS.
In fact, there are many who wish very much that they could be found, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "physical new" and close some holes in the Model.
This one, we must say, still has enormous shortcomings, not proposing any explanation for gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-ups!).
But we haven't found any such deviations at CERN until now.
Impacts
The impact of this research on Mr. and Mrs. All-World's daily life is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such research.
In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger.
They were interviewing scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already been told by physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 -, initially the laser was seen rather as a "Labo gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the search.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optical work.
This sensor, although not at all its original intention, now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras in the world, and earned it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This of course does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
In this essential area, however, much remains to be done.
The Devoir tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was eating him had left him a two-year break.
"They had given me five years to live, I made seven years," he said, half-fig half-raised, lying in his bed at the palliative care home Victor-Gadbois, from Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents it from going alone to the toilet, and even from eating alone.
Attached in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even comes to smile, talks to the strangers who deal with him, bring him his drugs, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
" During our life, we learn that a man is standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois' house.
Returning to the child's stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept regression," he notes.
For, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the palliative care home Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
At this stage, the "team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "conscious and stifled".
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
" I have no more wishes in life," she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
However, in the next few days, she is expecting a final visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers are given care of the body and food aid.
It's palliative care that we give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
It's very little when we know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the home's doctors.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When dying, we will agree to provide mouth care to brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetes will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of the daily life.
Last night, we had a beer served to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
" We help relatives as much as patients, " says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but do not resemble each other.
Alongside an old 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family assembly in the courtyard, well-shut in his pillows while being trinated in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
" For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45, " worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to ease suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his or her life, whether at home, at the hospital or in a care home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Société de care palliatifs à domicile du Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec's health care that causes several physicians specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by the tops of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in an emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients are only asking to die because they don't get the proper care.
And at the same time, several oncologists crave on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Helen Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she abandoned proven chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, did she tell me.
Yet she told me I was finished!
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask to die thank the caregivers for not having accessed their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care at the Society for Palliative Care at Home in Greater Montreal, patients would be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of their lives, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which means sleeping the patient until the time of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unstressed patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Sick people who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die. "
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me," that means "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible through a Journalism Fellowship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fund-raisers from political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia speak day by day about what they know about a formidable "system", mixing building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
A "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers a great deal, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has been getting colder since we took the lead," said Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Parliament in Quebec City and former Montreal Chief of Police.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation into the embezzlements related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had consented only in retrospect.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, hidden party financing and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he pointed out, the only ministry of transport would have spared a billion dollars on contracts," some refrencing their instincts to reach a quota!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "demonstrating the stratagems behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also working with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
The more the officers of the "Marteau squad" who, since 2009, would have led Montreal's "discharge cartel" to put the soft pedal on the inflating of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and charged fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his position as Mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that it has repeatedly stacked bribes in exchange for public contracts.
In addition, engineers on the road to Montreal and contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambimo, are formally accused.
The latter made sense by explaining to the Commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a Mafia-related intermediary who was returning money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambimo sowed in all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts inflated costs
In Montreal, the corruption "system" functioned roundly.
Gilles Surprising, former public works engineer, detailed it well before the commission: in ten years, he received from gift-building companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totalling $736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts that he was inflating the costs of.
Other road officials admitted that they had fattened their legs by inflating the bills from 30% to 40%, by false extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his boxes with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunged Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first chosen to pull the alarm bell.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, she insurgents since 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought $5 million and sold... 1.6 million to developers, in full real estate boom.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will eventually be put in place, she says that she "draws on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the wrongs".
The process, she says, is "painful but positive".
We're cleaning up the wound, but it would take a Montreal-specific investigation unit and a day before, not to see suspicious practices return.
Just like we do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes from his side that "public servants have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "chosen in the knowledge of the strategism", when they did not fall into the magouille!
Estimating 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he ironized: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the donations to the parties to $100 but this will not change the dice, according to him: "As long as we do not strictly limit electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He called for a complete revision of the system of public contracts and party financing: "We cannot go any further; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own courtyard...
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you took on a new scale with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the GSP.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I progress alongside them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in the game, it's easier.
It's all going very fast in football.
But I don't get inflamed.
From my beginnings to the pre-formation center of the INF Clairefontaine to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in steps.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to fighting very high-level games.
They also know that each training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He was supported by assistants such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in League 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and won a lot of titles with high-end clubs.
He sided with great players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heartwarming discussion with him.
I was then out of a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
What are you looking at on the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as leader.
But we're still ambushing.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, everything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, so we can receive at the 8th return.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and register for the duration.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the GSP is giving itself the means to make this project happen.
In League 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we're really in the mood for this champion title.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We've had a really big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, has achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win it.
Do you think the media are waiting too long for the PSG?
It's normal that we expect a lot of us in view of what's been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and find things to blame us again, it's sure that's a little frustrating.
People are wondering what else people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We've proven in the Champions League that we can respond to the present.
Look at Manchester City who hasn't been able to qualify for the 8th final for two seasons, they've also made huge expenses!
In view of the money invested, we imagined you with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to have the smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won it.
PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's exploits.
Good thing we say there's a Zlatan addiction.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he sets many goals.
He came for it and he proves he's the star of League 1.
He proved wherever he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he's done is really exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grappling with playing time.
I saw things there and got stronger.
Today, I can make good games in selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine and we must now have exemplary behaviour.
What are you looking at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good nul (1-1) pulled out on 16 October in Spain a founding game?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite is true of current currency exchanges based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of peer-to-peer files.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around about ten dollars (courses are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has been interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes itself from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The Facebook social network has also developed this kind of system.
But each time a central authority controls and treats trade.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are both account book depositors, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses in the way of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and whose winner, sort of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a phase of file hacking, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "take" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other knots easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any changes would change the footprint.
If, to fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, leaving the margin of...
The challenge is also raised at each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also mentions the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of the bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant balances" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of an educational book on this currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but he uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come back cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They simply communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that thousands of users are available.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to take, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered to be high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans are expected to follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future without waiting for us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, as were Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by local insurgents, they will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, took place in order.
Truck and armoured convoys joined Kabul without being attacked, overflew by helicopters.
There won't be a Taliban rollover on Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood due to the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants overtaken by the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mujahedin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They moved in as a businessman, seizing from government lands to sell them on land to build refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They did not consider themselves; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to benefit from the American broads: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They sided with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish leaflets that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, like Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, in particular on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
No industry has been restarted, no dams are in place, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to treat iron or copper ore on site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost left Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to search the immense Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
It will also be necessary one day for Afghanistan and Pakistan, whose imports and exports depend heavily, to restore normal relations.
The departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: secondary school for girls, boys, French department at university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win the hearts and minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of coinciding aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, led, and carried out by a small French NGO, numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, gourmets in local labor, were able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased cultivable surfaces.
What will we leave as a souvenir, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa Province.
In order to free themselves from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, what farmers have said to me, small, well-controlled and directly affected civil aid should be maintained in their favour.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It's a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, it has decided to play its va-tout.
Taking everyone in court, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave this House two more months to complete its work.
For the next two years Egypt has relied on a provisional text, several times amended which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic deliriousness", continuing to "trace his word" and to "peetinate the law".
On the side of his supporters, it is assured that this is a way of ending the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the challenge rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since this use of a hasty vote results from the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "You either vote for my text or I keep the full powers", they are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, by a large majority Islamist, voted on the text yesterday.
Most Liberals were missing the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing that they had not been able to put forward their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, replacement members, were added to the haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles have been voted on.
Indeed, commentators enjoyed the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the constituent's pendulum was poorly resolved.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
Objects of all attention, article 2 finally remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the "establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a pledge of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the Liberals replied, who saw only a stroke of communication there.
For they believe that the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include section 220, which confers an advisory role on Al-Azhar University, in particular with respect to verifying compliance with the Sharia law.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the premies of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are further exacerbated by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not olemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" temper Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes "that there can be ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used borrow from the religious vocabulary.
It refers to "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And in the future, the question might arise as to how competent civil judges are to decide on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of its extended powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as called for by human rights associations.
The latter also voice their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticid.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, there is no longer any mention of the protection of women, says Heba Morayef, Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the Head of State will march them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the centre of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argomenty i Fakty has chosen five great reasons to visit Israel.
Go to worship holy places
Make yourselves indispensable: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone entering these "baptismal backgrounds" will be touched by the divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of Jesus' miracles: where water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on water, where he calmed down the storm, or where fishing was miraculous.
It was in this precise place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
The believers go through the Rue de la Souffrance or the Via de Croix (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretoria), where the trial took place, then leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Onction and to the tomb.
This is where the Christian center of the world is, a symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different denominations leave small words with prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the Massada fortress, a former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can go there by their own means.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which hosts many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to have once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
The country is home to nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that really are worth turning around.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also to be seen: the Art Museum of Tel-Aviv.
The paintings of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are mainly exhibited.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of mouldings of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures of Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
The entrance is free and donations are forbidden.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or Memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Stars sparkle.
You then hear the names of Jewish children and the names of countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned here.
Health and well-being
Israel's three major seaside resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air temperature can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, 417 m below sea level.
Blue water contains brine and very easily retains bathers, even those who can't swim.
The landscapes surrounding it are surrealistic beauty.
Here we come to make a treatment based on salt water, lemon, curative sludge and to cure various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of Antiquity
They are kept by the old town of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Persée saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in narrow alleys that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, destiny will smile at you.
In Jaffa you will be able to meet young married people who have come to take photo sessions from all Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, King Herod's city, you can walk in the Roman theatre, "conquer " the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (now $1 equals 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop their activity.
And the workweek starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafés, restaurants and hotels serve only homemade food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also humous, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, balls of wet chickpeas, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-nourished cats who walk the high air.
We can see them sleeping at night on the roofs of parked cars.
These felines love the places passing and do not refuse to be spoiled.
Car rental varies according to the brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mostly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Who language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are controversial about what the mandatory language test law will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already appeared in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language, as well as the history of Russia and the foundations of law, will have to be validated.
We will need to validate his language skills in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who obtained certificates or degrees of education prior to the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Pushkine, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the State University of St Petersburg and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass examinations in all cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already asked the question in the press many times: what is it going to give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery to work".
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, on the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in a crowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will torment themselves for months without food and paper and will have to go between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they are taken their passport, and they do not receive the intended salary," confirms the Head of the Directorate of Migration Services for the Work of the Migration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, Officer!
However, many citizens of the republics of Central Asia who wish to come and earn money in Russia trust that they do not only know the language of the country where they wish to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is of course not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow only a fair primary education.
In fact, their families don't even have anything to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people go out and earn money as soon as the opportunity comes.
It's hard when you don't know the language, trust them.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will only be for migrants with legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal examination or work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or defend you from entering"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles.
And then we can get a false recording quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 roubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," told journalists Oumed Khuchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.
"Be quick, don't hurt and buy yourself a beautiful piece of art"
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by Federal Migration Service employees.
Falsified papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for anything: each migrant who hoped to do so would facilitate the task of examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is twice and a half more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The representatives of power and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper tips".
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination at first time the time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian arms carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether they are shooting at weddings or killing organised by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to prohibit the use of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the permit to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced into the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "closing the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various firing centres, demand to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC, told the Russian service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered with the police, while 1,168 thousand crimes were registered during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves with the black market.
According to them, we can find today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years at the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot from a site taking weapons commands
The first is "the military trail", i.e. the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets explains.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stocks and weapons stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often experienced explosions.
"Attested versions indicate that some fires have been deliberately triggered to conceal the deficit," explains the former military officer.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private weapons factories that do not compete with competition on the international market and drain weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," says one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A large proportion of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," adds the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the army and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons in the black market were found there "because of the employees whose work is linked to the weapons," the report explains.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from military conflict sites, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "rustholes".
A seller and consultant at a armory who asked to keep the anonymity ensures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these specialists of the clandestine search; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, the sellers will look for the new goods in the military warehouses.
The person purchases through a unit sign, e.g. a TT gun.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a fence.
"He transports it into town and sells it for 900 € by the unit with two shippers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be clarified, they make a purchase of control from illegal arms dealers," the seller adds.
" Like in a Luxury Shop "
The seller and buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I have consulted websites, blogs, until a guy shows up and proposes to come to Begovaya Station where someone was going to take me to a "coin" to market.
The price of the gun was given to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets in Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there we also have to come by saying, for example, "From such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter has lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of someone I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
The little new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The diagrams, according to him, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I thought I was in a luxury shop," the military remembers.
There is no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we go with the forest salesman and we set up a target.
"We let me shoot and when I'm convinced that the gun works well, we start negotiating," the expert says.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, we do not need any documents and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," it says in advertising on the site "Buying a gun or a combat machine gun."
Users leave their request and ask questions.
And we sell to minors?
"Unlicensed, of course", asks the user "Ivan" (orthograph retained).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of fake sites and picks up people who want to buy combat weapons.
People go on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia

I have heard about this type of scheme: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take over.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the "Right to a weapon" association, Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by applying on the site, we can find ourselves without a gun and behind bars.

One Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, according to experts, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a weapon" association, one can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
He left long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the Ministry's official data, compared to the period January-October 2011, the overall number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles, while the reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
United States: Fast-food and supermarket employees on strike
Almost a quarter of American teens go through cashier work at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages of Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time being, no one can predict whether this wave is going to grow or suffocate quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages received by the basic employees at Walmart and in the fast food chains, the organizers of the events want to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The demonstrations started last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", at the time when a spilling rain of balances taking millions of people fell on America and sometimes triggering sladders.
On that day, some employees of Walmart's company, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs to organize strike pickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the stores of the company whose products are intended for consumers of the modest and medium classes.
Walmart commercializes everything: from layers to hunting rifles through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid employees at Walmart only shop at their workplace.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell his cheap products, especially because of his employees' low wages.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lift trucks or portable scanners.
Participants in the "Black Vendredi" protests demanded an increase in salary, they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who reaches $9.5 an hour, it's a sum he can't afford.
Scientists at Berkley California University show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
It's 1.1% more than he currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all the wage increases to consumers' shoulders, each race in the store would be 46 cents more.
In just one year they will spend $12.39 more than now.
Walmart's supporters noted with satisfaction that protests took place in only nine states and did not harm the group.
The "Black Vendredi" continued in stores from 8 a.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over this period 5000 items per second.
Its caisses carried out 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
The spokesman for Dan Fogleman assured in an interview at the left site Huffington Post that in all "less than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs and that the protest was only a "com' operation among many others" from the organizing union.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York City and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not much appreciated, which is why they are not yet located there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for the work you've done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food increases them over time, but little by little, on average, its base employees get $8.90 an hour in New York City.
No one touches less than they do in this town.
It's inconceivable for me to live with that amount in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum we find comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near the McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, a multiplication of more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the area of rapid restoration.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protestors by bullying or redundancies.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking over rapid restoration remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree.
Other tumultuous events were held near several other fast food chains.
The key moment of the protest was the gathering in the middle of the day near McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for the work you did honestly!".
The protesters were supported by other New York Democrats in view, including Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we all have to support workers in fast food to get a fair wage and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important one in the fast food sector in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not to mention that not all were fast-food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult for the moment to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
"For the time being, we can only do a little bit of brain error."
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving the augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, Google unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it emerges from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, glasses are already from ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in bare-handed air, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time try to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the time being with pixels on a flat screen and sometimes with touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in controlling by gesture.
- What does the future hold for us as well?
- Although Kinect has made physical interaction, many things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The capture of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for now, is not really.
We are trying to change this and we are working on truly 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We have to get the computer world out into ours, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it.
Thus, we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of the voice control?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
One cannot say that it is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of his actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held bracelet recording the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can?
You'd do it with the word and with the gestures.
- I usually only talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at some point?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
They can be laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth, and it's very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what don't you like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we rely on our work on 3D recognition.
Of course it would be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, adding work to algorithm designers.
The resolution must be kept in mind according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s are really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, gave the touch of the sensors a regular delay of treatment between 1 and 100 μs, with the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this kind in my work, but I don't need to touch, to have more frames in the second.
- But shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a normal sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a soft product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone raised hands is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transit" that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and that is what makes their strength (the personal elements are the ones you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality increased from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem on which the opponents of this idea point their finger: there is no touchy sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really meant to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a precise point where the finger is located and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the ends of the fingers.
There are also wrist bracelets that affect nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
There's still a task down there that will take a long time to get hurt: the way to make someone physically believe that he is in a very small space that he works in an almost infinite open space - we work on the concepts of racing rugs (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the time being, the brain can only be tricked, and there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting to the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The avant-garde petersbourgeois" dedicated to the urban people who are in advance, to the avant-garde of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already received eminent actors from the artistic scene of St Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city's border and who have found recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all red dressed that we can meet near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the parties and varnishes connected.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather crowds, regardless of their place of exhibition.
He is one of the land-based social and philosophical storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the avant-garde petersbourgeois of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in good mood.
He recently took a barbarian organ into his hands and became the symbol of this instrument in Saint Petersburg as he had matured enough for this difficult role by his existence, philosophy and image as a Bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you travel the city in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue, for example?
- I chose red as a costumer specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray causes aggressiveness and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to begin the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Culture Palace where my work was.
I realized it was my way.
So, the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, in my genre, were misunderstood.
I began to bond with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to be at the centre of Saint Petersburg culture where the best creative forces must meet.
In 1995, I took a place in Puchkinskaya-10, which was home to a music and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the home of the Bohemian Bohemian.
Many were born there: The NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in play-backs in molding jerseys, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, a composer today in fashion.
When the band started to play live, it became Leningrad.
Trakhtenberg enjoyed many shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his basic education and training was at home that he received them.
Galerie "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are the effects of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the "The Personalities of Our City" award.
I was named "Peinter of the Year", and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have very strong news and acuity.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum through the clowns."
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it scares me to be like this.
But with clowns, it's all over, the tragic fall.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to spit on his trunk.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of Barbarian organ player. - A cultural city must have that kind of hero.
Who else can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art must be cured, delicate, liqueur.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into herds, Bohemian supporters loved one thing, denied them another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Every star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- They're people we've been throwing away who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come, and at the end of the day it's less management, money, everything goes down.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to fool them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption doesn't have a culture, it doesn't have anything to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are discarded, because there is a need for higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and make a path for them.
Currently, it is the "kingdom of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg to you?
- Saint Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, art is hard to grow.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, that's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very fine.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange
Sleeping in space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with landowners on board are heading for a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how can we continue to make our species live as pests or on a planet of relief?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two true planets that we can conquer, if only by hypothesis.
" This is Venus and Mars, " says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the State Astronomy Institute P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We started to focus on reproduction issues in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then, insects, small breeding drosophilic flies, were placed in orbit.
In 1979, cauldron eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo developed in awe.
We get a totally normal chick at the exit.
It is then that the problems begin.
" The problem is related to the fact that the chick has to find a support, he has to get on his legs and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By finding no support, the chicks were acting disorderly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts all over each other.
The chicks didn't react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We have scratched their eyes twice, then we have abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experience with chicks in space.
The last biological miniature arch with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, biosatellite "Bion" will only board species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
" It was still biosatellites and then it was the only experience. Such research must be carried out, " notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats of space gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are not yet possible directly in space.
It's not a big deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to achieve their sexual instincts.
Unlike beasts, man is capable of it, in principle.
Homo sapiens possess abstract thinking, he is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the feminine organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our mutt flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight in space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the robbery.
" No one answered this question, " explains Vakhtang Vatchnadze, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice in orbit and even working in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
" And if they are longer, it poses a danger even during orbiting flights, " concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology laboratory of the Centre for the Preparation of Cosmonauts: mandatory stage of the preparation for flight.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train at extra-vehicle exits.
The water mimics the appeasement.
If for adults, the water is comfortable but nevertheless a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibian men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves about 9 months into the lymphatic fluid of his mother's stomach, it is easier for him to get used to water.
It is logical in principle, because from its birth to its first bath, it only takes 2 weeks.
" It's very little to forget, " explains the infant swimming instructor, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born the burden is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a weight force.
In awe, the muscles of the belly, the basin atrophy very quickly, the baby's push capacity is lost.
All right, let's just ignore this by relying on the birth simulators.
Of course we can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will get it out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to ask to think about this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the earth's attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can't dress an infant like an adult with a special combination for workouts.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, totally disabled," says the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, over time this will become a reality, when the Terrians go into their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Higher Institute for Public Finance Control) said: "The control of pseudo-independent work (in Czech " Švarc system ") failed because of politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is lagging behind in its implementation.
This is what Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Higher Institute for Public Finance Control, said in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us," Kala said in her comment on the current situation.
A joint check carried out by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the "Švarc system" by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG would not bother contractors with controls, so is it permissible or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from inspecting compliance with the law," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the laws on public procurement in these two countries were compared.
What was it really about?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation, as well as practice itself, follow it up.
We have gathered all this and although this monitoring procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more stringent and better quality", however, according to certain parameters, practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not sufficient to develop ever-increasingly detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely and what is the result for you?
Joint control of this type should help us to stop trying to clarify laws, to lower and to improve thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering market thresholds, we will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork that those who look for flaws will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems with the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different mode of organization?
With regard to the institutions, similar to the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there, which is organised similarly, it also has a somewhat different council, but these two institutions are basically proceeding in a similar way .
Competences are also, to some extent, similar, however, with a nuance compared to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it therefore also has such accounts prices at the level of the different Länder.
The HRB can only control federal money, which corresponds to the state's resources at home.
The public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the Länder' accounts.
With regard to national legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it does better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better inspectors?
No, I'm sure not, but I repeat, I don't have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we regard as a model is also confronted with a whole range of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
With regard to national legislation, what did the amendment of the Public Procurement Act mean to you as an institution, does it already have any effect?
Since this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our control operations.
As we do ex post controls, we have to count on some delay.
Our observations concern only, for the time being, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument for "risk detection of mismanagement" with which we have gone to the test of nearly 14,000 public contracts - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been modified as well as the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or an additional burden for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and that they cannot be respected.
Already under the previous regulatory regime, the claimant (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the Market Act means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful, then, to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who commit formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on administration.
So what's the way out?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the SDO was not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority that is responsible for inspecting and enforcing the law.
He may say: "We will change the law and authorize it, " but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing was at all.
The contract law contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be performed, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder should be eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and it is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are in frozen places, but most remain feasible.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy as well.
The network, however, remains largely feasible, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary region
In the Karlovy Vary area, the roads were practical this morning, but in frozen and snowy places as well.
Temperatures have dropped and fluctuate between -5° and -10°C but they are expected to rise slightly during the day.
Snowfalls have ceased in the area and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
However, the ridges of the Monts metalliferes (Krušné hory) are covered with about 30 centimetres of snow.
The data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service show that due to fog, visibility was in reduced locations.
The R6 rapid track and the national roads of the region are now feasible without difficulty.
However, vigilance remains to be applied, for example on certain bridges whose surface can be frozen and sliding.
All departmental and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
It still remains on some of their sections of frozen snow debris and in traffic-smoothed places.
Especially in altitude areas, drivers need to increase their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some East Bohemian roads are threatened by ice formation and that traffic-tagged snow layers can be found on the roads in mountainous and high-lying areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in areas of the area of Pardubice at altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is found mainly in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic-smoothed snow is present on the roads in altitude areas.
In Eastern Bohemian times will today be dry, most often clear, with possible cloud passages.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will generally fluctuate between -3° and + 1° C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now feasible, although in places there is a need to be more vigilant and to adapt its conduct to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures fluctuate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfalls and subsequent cooling, some channels of communication may be in frozen locations.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, however visibility will gradually improve.
This is evident from the information provided by the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
The D5 motorway can be operated almost without difficulty, however, road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between the 80 and 131 kilometres.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the South Pilsen district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third category lanes are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on less frequented roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to areas of the Olomouc region at altitudes must now have a thick and soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the hill called "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical treatment operations.
Snowfalls forced road maintenance personnel to travel to the field this night; according to road services, they fell more than three centimetres in the district of Šumperk.
In the other parts of the region, most of the pavements can be used without difficulty.
" On the heights of the district of Šumperk are snow remains.
Drivers travelling in the direction of Jeseník must expect to meet at the "Červenohorské sedlo" pass a thick and soft layer of snow " said today to ČTK the head of road maintenance services of the district of Šumperk.
Their colleagues in the district of Jeseník also went to the scene during the night; according to them, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads can be operated without difficulty, in the district of Šternberk the drivers should, however, pay attention in the sections in forest areas on wet roads.
Regions of Ustí nad Labem and Liberec
As of this morning, the maintenance services of the roads of Bohème du Nord have reported several difficult sections.
It appears from the police data that in addition to certain places covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south-east of the Bohème Central Plateau, there are no problems on the contrary and roads are usually dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of glaciers, particularly around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowmelt during the day, clear sky and frost during the night.
Since the main routes of traffic, difficult conditions have also been reported on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ustí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closing of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have bent under the weight of the snow until reaching the road.
Šimon Ornest said: " In concert, we want to collect positive energy. "
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our Tap Tap group, we laugh at it rather and we say that we are the only group capable of collecting a rest of positive energy in order to repel or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
This is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
On December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will close almost when the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati in the peaceful ocean will end, on a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who had that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded an anthem against the end of the world called " End of the world cancelled " (in Czech " Konec světa zrušeno ").
She's already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear it at these charitable concerts?
Of course, everything at the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place...
She will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
Anthems will also join at some point in a unique live broadcast of Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charitable events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will be the benefit of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on at the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the Jedličkýv Institute students and offer them activities that interest them and amuse them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several music groups and performers go on stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, have you chosen them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratrasphere with Dan Barrta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will be on stage.
Details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; there too, we will probably prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the Czech Republic house in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not that bad that it looks first.
We have five electric wheelchair members whose gears must travel in a cargo hold, of course we also walk a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
So far everything has been more or less always well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we came back recently, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to your trips abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the east all are still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to move alone in an electric chair in the centre of the city.
They still do not consider it obvious that a person in a wheelchair should be given priority in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association seeking to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.
How should we still catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements still depend on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy handicap to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the bathroom, the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are on the contrary at the cutting edge of progress!
Public respect and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous jurists among us.
For the time being, it is only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I was surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And as I myself am a musician (among other things, I play saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láůa Angelovič says, we've lost some control of the situation (laughs).
Has success occurred only in recent years, if I'm not mistaken?
True, creating links with known singers and working actively to promote the group helped us.
We understood that, if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to European Union grants, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Were you aiming to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was potential for change.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Few are the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with a disability are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take pity on.
They are people who can live a whole life and flourish, provided they have the necessary means of doing so, of course.
I often say that when people with a disability come to realize something, it is not only an advance for them but for the whole of society.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think it's quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, follow preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap Group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
One, there's Angelovič.
We're an open group, people go in and out, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case the day before the planned day of the end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relays when the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world cancelled" will be co-songned.
The purpose of the concert is to gather financial resources (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years old, the ticket pre-sale is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as a twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the years that followed it participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, Poland's road to outer space began much earlier.
Already before World War II, passionate Poles worked on space flights; they did not always encounter understanding.
For example, I would like to refer to A. Šternfeld's conference at Warsaw's Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his avant-garde book entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagator of the world-renowned astronaut, his contribution has been rewarded in particular by the fact that his name has been given to one of the craters on the hidden face of the Moon.
As early as 1925 a drain was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
Nor is it clear whether the rocket should be used to propel or brake the drain.
The only known information about this raisin is that of the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the documents retained that this research had reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research has stopped.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric hunting rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year the book "Rakieta - torpedoa powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects aimed at military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all rocket technology projects were conducted by the interim scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other work on aviation was published in the Polish press, thanks to Polish astronaut society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is a company in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Problememe, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aviation.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to astronomy.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish astronautic society (PTA) made efforts to enter the international astronautic federation (created in 1951) and, as early as autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He retained his position until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This 1800-metre rocket had a length of 80 cm and weighed just under 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version, RM-1A and, during the summer of 1959, two-storey RM-2 rocket flight tests were started in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was 1.4 metre long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket was developed during the period 1962 - 1965, following the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 litre, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litre and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 litre.
The maximum range of all these types of equipment was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a COSPAR National Committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on the Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Miroslav Hermaszewski pilot became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this programme.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision raised in public opinion a lively discussion.
It is certainly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means concretely that the different economic entities and national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital combined with a frantic financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour prices (wages) create a pressure on prices.
The following meaning should be put into effect: a producer strives to import low-priced goods to resist economic competition by " making the price of the competitor " more expensive, in order to remove a greater share of the market and thus increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, buying cheaply, or disappearing. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the State's social burdens necessarily increase.
This whole situation intensifys the complete unwillingness of gentlemen to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is at such a point of public awareness that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in different economies a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to their homes.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is reflected mainly in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept the diktat of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages.
This is due to a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and to the restriction of employees' rights in the field of labour law.
This results in increasing poverty and widening the gap between the rich and the poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, there have been for years public food distribution points for poor people who cannot afford their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees to receive such wages that the State is forced to pay an additional fee to achieve the minimum living standard.
Such a scandal, for example, has been brought up to date in the case of employees working as assistants to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the Member States of the south of the EU undoubtedly create a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with poverty wages, in the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
Here we have to ask ourselves the following question: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will go from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, a Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also applies to Latin America as a whole.
Liberal theory and the media state that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the led economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
We must then ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not, according to its own selfish interests, govern politics and by the same, the whole State.
The answer to this question is certainly yes.
The evidence is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby in all States.
This results in a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the development of bills to law firms closely related to industry.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
The entire power does not come from the people, as declared by the Western constitutions, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberalist-oriented democracies are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "the crisis of the Roman empire in the time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State was long in delicacy and the functions were attributed by violence.
The bribes, the favors obtained illegally, and the stones and the swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-tables and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with voices already sold" ... ... "The honest people were not seeking any functions, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls". ... 'We really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that we had to choose a energetic man" ... It is true that Appianos had in mind Pompey, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and asserting the interests of society as a whole.
Today, as in the past, the result is an unprecedented decadence of elites, without any effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
We must therefore look at the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the present state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises that we are now witnesses to, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and internally, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution is socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Chaos laboratory.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will" says Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose main verse of the chorus is "don't forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would be no wars," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer's wife Amschel Rothschild on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have risen.
Some take the Israeli side, arguing for their right to self-defence and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is victim in its waves of recurrent killings; all in all, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in this political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a view "behind the curtain", on the one to which they take advantage mainly of the tensions that have been going on for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East country.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others emerge from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely from the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or whether they owed their actions to someone who led their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been able to take place in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s, they acquired the first world press agency (Reuters) to end the establishment of links between their names and serious criminal acts to which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or leading wars against countries in which they have not yet had such stakes (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after Iraq's invasion of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only of 4, in the meantime Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew to the Bank of America of Rothschild the status of central bank and began to issue his own money during the civil war (government, I hear well) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to sue the EDF for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for world power led in the 1859s to 1871s to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated in the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The aim of the first war was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, particularly the British, and the third was to reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and ultimately acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with at their head the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent repeated crises such as those caused in 1907).
After having succeeded in unleashing the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir Habsburg to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended abruptly by German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed politicians to create a latent conflict situation: on the one hand, they imposed far-reaching war reparations on Germany, thus generating the conditions for radicalisation of the impoverished masses (they then had to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing fingers at the culprits, offering simple solutions) and on the other, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a large German minority who had to play the role (which it actually held) of fifth column to set fire to the powders and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspires to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above laid the foundations for a mass emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The second world war broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had initially held it; or if all he did was planned, the fact is that the sufferings of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as the war reparations imposed on Germany led to the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel ignited a firefire that could cause a third World War.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people divide bitterly between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong causes another wrong according to a circle of endless violence and where, at the origin of everything, there is the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire power throughout the world?
Here we must make the difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, like our home, international bankers offer people in elections only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything to trigger a war with Iran, who could, because of the country's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a global conflict and, since Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz through which 20% of all world oil passes (this naval corridor is only 2 miles wide) and generates a destruction of the world economy.
In what light now appear the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrates of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new born is implanted at birth an electronic chip making it a totally controlled being.
" Let them force all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slave to bear on the hand or forehead a mark with red iron, so that they may neither buy nor sell the one who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
One must understand: that he who has common sense counts the figures of this fierce beast.
This number refers to man and is six hundred sixty six."
The movie Argo: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters made up of Islamist students attacked the American Embassy of Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who had supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer the American administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, further aggravated by the fiasco of the attempt to release hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate stirs up a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle strongly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered America a small victory.
Just before she was busy, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated journeys, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran thanks to a rock cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to make an impression on the filming of a science-fiction film.
Gender combination
The plan of exfiltration expert Tony Mendez requires Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is on the one hand a political thriller designed realistically but also a "caper moie", the story of a successful coup, of a treasuries - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The atmospheres follow: sequences of documentary-style Tehran (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photographs, these same situations have been transcribed in the film, there are no big differences),
Lighter Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a little bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in restarting his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his actor's play ceased to elicit ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark cop "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film that does not take place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where Tehran's role is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets during the reconstruction of real events; the initial sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive by its clarity which also suggests confusion and unpredictability when suddenly, in a given place, a history page is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the fake shooting team in Tehran's bazaar).
Too many actions to too many places
The director had to be content with a subject that actually offered few thrilling scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It does well, it sometimes adds certain elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the landing track are quite pulled by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in his dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events to too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from that, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he lets himself be seen with a moderate interest, appreciating the performance and retro style of the 1970s.
He leads the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history still, in a certain way, unfinished to date, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the trick.
Rules to Inflate Balloons, Bananas and Circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts a public survey every year on the most absurd banking costs, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has been planning to adopt a quota of 40 per cent of women for the management of large European companies in recent times has led to our decision," said Právo, the organiser of this survey, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, for example, there is already the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
To date, however, women have been advanced in terms of life insurance rates because they objectively represent a lesser risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations are, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has adverse consequences for the environment, or the prohibition to use reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Criticisms have also been expressed in the past against the de facto prohibition of using the term "trickling butter" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimetres.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or group of States (and the Czech Republic currently imposes the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups, for example, are also at the root of the fact that bananas in the Union should not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal disorder".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it only harmonized non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
The standards for fruits and vegetables were relaxed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that existing directives lead to food waste.
The first price will be awarded in this survey to last year's EU regulation that must include a warning on inflatable balloons that children under 8 years of age should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an American investigation that balloons are, among toys, the first cause of death of children by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 with respect to blowing in fair trumpets.
We have weird ideas at home, too.
The following rule concerning European civil servants themselves is rather absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedoine" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Let Do" of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com has named in this investigation, in addition to some absurdities mentioned above, the Union regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food stocks which could be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and therefore risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for subsidies.
These ideas, however, are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea handicaps us.
We will ask the European Union for a refund." Thus, in the autumn of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had found itself with full stocks that it had then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organised a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which had to be used, in practice, to prepare applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU states: "Strange regulations are rare".
While the regulations often raise criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union and in the field of its general development deserve praise.
More serious, for example, according to experts, is the problem of the use of EU grants for projects which have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which were imposed by the Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic must, like other countries of the Union, fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (which it does not always win out of which it does not win) gives rise to strong emotions among the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomucké tvarżžky", in respect of the name "Tuzemský rum" that dates back to our home in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not on beet sugar, may bear the name rum.
The official list of EU registered products now includes cheeses known worldwide as the Feta or Gorgonzola, the Lübeck massepan or Parma ham, the Karlovy Vary biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary"), the Pohořelice and Třeboř carps ("Pohořelický a Třebońský kapr") and Žatec hops ("Žatecký chmel").
The Pardubice spice bread ("Pardubický perník") and the cakes called "Cornets de Hořice" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how did we come up with the idea of running for the presidential election?
It's not being a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer stand to see how the country has been plundered over the past 20 years, that thieves are not under locks and taxes and the retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, then I'm trying to find a way to make it change.
And since I am more than forty years old and am independent, a member of no party, I have no other options to influence the situation than to stand in presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate, but you quickly set out for the Castle (N.d.T.: seat of the Presidency).
Don't you turn your back on those who elected you?
I've always said that I'm going to start the battle for the castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Subsequently, I stated that if I were elected as a senator, I would run for the presidential election.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we go to the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we trample down those who are trying to bring about change.
In addition to this is the press that breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was told that I bribe journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek's advisor.
Let's get to your visions.
You started the fight for the Castle with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax declarations beyond twenty million [of CZK] as a battlehorse.
You must change the law for that purpose.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I was a citizen, I pushed for tourism guide activities to be a professional profession, I got a win.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from the left or right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma supporters, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself rather like a man on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are putting me on the left instead.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we're moving forward.
What matters to me is not whether people are left or right, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a certain optimal purpose and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken about it.
But without the support of Parliament, all you have left are slogans.
You won't survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I must convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then eventually explain why they do not want them.
When there is a strong personality who will identify abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, which was obtained through the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, without any compromises, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I've just started politics and I'm trying to get majority support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can't make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities asking them to come to the senatorial elections as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the oil fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did, for the most part, gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the election by direct suffrage of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning on founding your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I don't have any money for my presidential campaign either, I only have twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property to be about 60 million.
I have in Prague a plot worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a boy's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving by car, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You run in Aston Martin, you have a worth 60 million and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money in it?
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already invested two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program doesn't attract much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign in my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration that I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live on it, for example paying for my son's English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I won't run for election.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities in the deaf?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take over the travel agency in spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were a contractor?
I was winning and I kept winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I was president, I would end my business.

The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To convince themselves, just contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected book mountain - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it does very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the lower side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large nearby company, tells us: "Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one else willingly goes to one of these curly libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that has nothing to do with the gates of Rotterdam, has a fairly special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give back a few neurons to the brains, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of pretty little painted reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get back to statistics: building a library!
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam architect's office MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of buildings full of spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and presented himself to the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneezing on his face.
And while the jury members were still looking, disconcerting and raising their shoulders, Maas, the facet, stacked his books of choice in order of size to make it a pyramid, and finished his speech supported by activist arguments by a: "common honey!"
Here she is, my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, or, as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million-euro mountain came up from land.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office, and a few buildings and houses for a total of 50 dwellings.
In early November, the book mountains received the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, this small, dull town, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a town hall of a horrifying uglyness, whose white facades invite to think that they shelter a dairy, has enriched itself with a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado from the book under cheese bell.
Certainly, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the true joys of reading and architecture open to you when you tread the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant reverbs speak unequivocally the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking at public benches, dogs, and little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books, and books.
"Normally, the library beams are located along the façade and in the middle there is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
We completely altered the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been conveniently arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes muddy, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stair ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hardened building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in a Frisian farm.
In the Netherlands, one millimetre thick synthetic membrane has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we save time.
The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimetres.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic " (KPL) changes its colour and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and pots figs.
They create an atmosphere, but they contribute mainly to maintaining the ideal level of air humidity in the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in the field of ecology," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is set by geothermal temperature.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior for a short time, even the days of beautiful weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted across the glass facade serve as a sunscreen, intercepting much of the rays.
The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic informatician, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already here, too.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" by Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure made it possible to fill the voids of the library that was not yet fully garnished (today, it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I think our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
Thus MVRDV has reached the master discipline that is called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new literary history page.
Even if it may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request for observer status in the United Nations.
But then she chose forbearance.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think that she does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but not to be too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 insurrection in Libya, Germany had also chosen forbearance in the vote on the establishment of an air-exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Is Germany having difficulty in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so as to say defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore face several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still taunting to find that role, but they're on their way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What, then, does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national files.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Near East.
German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position vis-à-vis the Middle East conflict and forbearance in the United Nations vote?
Germany has first important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to clash with public opinion, but also with the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive element.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, because it is not a purely unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive factor in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany undermine its relations with the United States by choosing forbearance in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans understand the German position perfectly.
That is why I think that the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Indeed, Germany has shown that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great that they always seem so.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overjoying Netanyahu's policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes it any easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore enter into a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are currently doing in the euro issue.
In my view, Germany will assume a locomotive role in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not simple for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Is Germany playing a major role on the international stage, does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or is it always difficult to assume leadership roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still faces difficulties in playing a more important role.
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make it any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is still the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It has to deal with very diverse neighbors and opinions, and it's not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is diminishing, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this vacuum, so who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're just less appreciated, it's life!

"Mark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially filed in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
The trademark thus enjoys such protection that the company bearing its name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, she's not sure she'd win a cause.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office specializing in violation of property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes to my office.
Impersonators only need a few additional letters to be able to register their brands.
Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports articles.
Pattloch opens a binder in which the registrations made at the Beijing Trademark Office are located.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by taking over part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping centres that sell virtually only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his principals charge him to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are appointed.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," says Pattloch.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and costs of justice amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest growing one.
However, it is not easy to delete dubious registrations from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch refers to the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarism because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the producer of Putzmeister concrete pumps.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's buyer, used before a blue and white logo that recalled BMW's one. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost to the plagiarisms of Hong Kong and Singapore that had reoriented the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing admits to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office would have moved last year from an "emergency situation in the course of the work to a found normality".
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were reportedly closed, representing an increase of 75% over the previous year.
However, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the Office.
Take expensive action
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark filing applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each recording averaged 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Of course, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"It's our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office had therefore rejected the Munichese's objection.
Freudenberg certainly won the case in the following two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight until today.
The vigilance is to put
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "The procedure is long, challenging and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archives service even had to review the actions of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "big sum in six-digit euros" to settle the dispute.
"That's what it means to us," Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region were to ensure the exploitation of unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file Freudenberg's name for a shoe and leather production company in Germany.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but could still have prevented the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Warning is a bet."
Pattloch and advises German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
In their view, it is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but foreigners should "register also in China all that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much greater than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or else we would lose our place in the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choral repeats in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans in Swaziland rejoice at their coming.
Here is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, you tap the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, sneakers for ladies and moccasins for men look for rhythm by hitting the foot floor. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the vocals of the singers slowly expand - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they conquer, enchant and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor loses almost his canvas shoes when he runs the orchestra with his actions of wild flexibility.
We are on Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years old came, from the geneticist in human medicine to the man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each singer has different words, all in a very exotic language: the zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Being helped to help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are suffering from AIDS.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in zoulou "teller of stories" or even "singer of praises".
No one can fluently speak the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that it has brought back to Germany and now to its native region: South Africa.
For at 8,733 kilometres by flight of bird from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw or earth huts and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has taken their parents.
In Eitjeni, there is a smaller scale of disease in Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the world's lowest life expectancy according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population is immune-deficiency virus carriers and it is not uncommon to die in the mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis especially saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is no prospect at all.
At first, they were only a few people who personally committed themselves to paying a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that since then has dealt almost professionally with the orphans of AIDS in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorragia (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubis lice and gall belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and blennorrhage often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contacts between men are responsible for at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungal), blennorrhage and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure has increased from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth over the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white loss, low-ventre pain, and the appearance of buttons and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect to 100%.
The reason for this is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by close body contact.
The experts therefore recommend that any person who often changes sexual partners should undergo regular examinations.
Most rapidly detected STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds that the chorists collect thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well housed, for example in one of their grandmothers.
The gogos are called the old women in the zoulu, they are the pillars of the village.
Some of them welcome up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed to a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare daily meals for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two hens. With the help of the American Health Organization PSI, the association organized a HIV testing test for many residents.
This is not true of itself, because even if the disease is very visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's a subject that affects sexuality."
It is rather curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in place of democracy.
These State-sanctioned customs, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
Yet condoms are found at every corner of the street, says Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to encourage some cultural exchange, Imbongi's choirists travel together every two or three years to South Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many people on the tip of the black continent still know of the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in African language is a sign of recognition such that it generates not only good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears a tear from a few formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their daughters.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you'll find light there," people say there.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers of bird flying, back to Heidelberg, in front of those chorists who kick foot in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe provided evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The layer of ice could be 20 meters thick.
The US Space Agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of ice cover in the region of the planet constantly diving into the shadows.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres up to 20 meters.
Water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, there is no link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other vital elements of life have arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which infinity is observed.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
As Pluto, orbiting the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "new-born" in the birthing room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this area where the stars were born, called "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation Cassiopée, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flashing glow of a dying star.
The doughnut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projectes when it dies.
In the immense trifide nebula, 5,400 light-years away from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, a cluster of stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope enhances colour value.
In this infrared photo, the Helice nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation Verseau.
His resemblances with a terrestrial continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular shade.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy concerns the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving any traces.
One of the largest and most clear photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the trifide nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
Trifide's name comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust sleds divide the shining heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers photographed the premises of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Serpentary: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the nuclei of two fusion galaxies rush one to the other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "southern fire wheel".
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years old and consists of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than the common domestic dust.
This photo was made from optical and radiographic photographs taken by different telescopes.
You can see the circle of black holes that is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies named Arp 273.
Scientists named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also constantly create young stars at 5,000 light years of the Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is not yet any dust, there is only gas.
Scientists think he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was largely composed of hydrogen.
Our look at the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and, thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Palomar Mountain Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed to the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe for extra-terrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extra-terrestrial intelligence") by contributing the computing power of his machine.
View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take photos before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that looks at the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space as early as 2018 on an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will include the mission of finding light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the Southern Pole of Mercure also houses ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this theory, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data had for decades indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first one to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty of this.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.

A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is of a complete romance.
At the turn of the many turns of the road, the small bus cahotes along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh lives, about which we don't know much, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azeri and that they have a very great longevity.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small plastrone town with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
"Bakou became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Longevity Museum, the only such museum in the world.
You can discover the life of about eight dozens of Talysh in the region who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Having another child at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Sirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when we think that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more than dubious.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and he would have had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would have designed a girl again.
Would Sirali Müslümov have been mistaken for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the man of Central Asia.
"Unbelievably old people also live in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," explains Scholz, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the non-existence of the documents, not to mention that there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
However, people in the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of Bible patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it's a food issue.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that Talysh's high-calorie meals, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products, many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With her 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a bar, whose content she untiringly beats.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two little children also play in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical armadus glasses in the shape of a belly.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf hide from long braids of a dark blonde that her son reveals to us with pride.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and they kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
All my life, I've never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda amazes in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who, however, led his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham later succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats monthly (about the same amount as in euros) for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life in the region.
And perhaps the long graying son of Mirzayeva is right: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
There are rival protests that reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft constitution based on sharia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not avarous of words filled with emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was intended for the entire people, but also especially for Christian Copts, Liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay people.
For all members of the opposition confused and desperately disunited are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost by apologizing, that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a PhD from the American University of South California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles written in haste by the majority Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a 15-hour night-force tour are indeed disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague formulation and the resulting legal room for manoeuvre to apply a stricter interpretation of sharia.
In any case, it suggests a newly introduced article stipulating that, with regard to all subjects relating to sharia, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The establishment is the country's most important Islamic institution and its brilliance shines throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would de facto result in the judiciary being placed under the supervision of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts began to punish the opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, one can read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, no article specifically guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or defaming the prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Just as doubtful is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a lawman?
Many points are therefore a matter of interpretation in the draft which Morsi submits to the vote and which, according to his own words, will "very soon" be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Reigned"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual agreement on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the sharia before it came into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win," says Hamdin Sabbahi, third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the waste bins of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi supporters of wanting to foment a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," exclaims Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated," said Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and opposition member.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim brotherhood called for a counter-event not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in it in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of God's law."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Qur'an [was their] Constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic place of Tharir, where everything began, would soon have created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, along with its supporters, had expressed themselves loud and loud.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot box of the country's leadership.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process, which should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even spoken once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged counsel.
These measures are critical breaches of the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto takes away all his powers," Saeda laments.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
This could be paid for.
A protestor on Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway's Rakfisk: Is it the most smelling fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway benefit from one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of the premises for an extremely odorous fish?
Take some advanced cheese.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt-spoiled trout and fermented in water for a duration - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to one year.
When the darkness settles and it's cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you drink a glass of aquavit," explains Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time firefighter who is also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for the management of the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and stuff a lot of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi who would have spent long hours on a bus.
Rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels, then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - without a doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, who emigrated mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so much richer than Norway, crossed the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, albeit odorous, element of Norway's past.
This is part of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not for him to regret.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this killing, they talk about "the July 22 incident."
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country one of their own might have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," explains Anna, our waitress, with a blonde hair and in the eyes of a piercing blue, the image of the Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk tray in her hand.
We are, as you say, prudent people.
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries threw money through the windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway managed to keep the strings of its stock exchange tight.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Not forgetting the rakfisk," she adds in a careless laugh.
I stand under the snow and line up to buy myself something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I'm staying in is one of many places where you use rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or maybe for the most smelling of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a bow tie, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
We'd think of the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you score for the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here's our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the fish emanations.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto has a hard start.
While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the difficulties that await him and the many people's expectations.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a safety dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits you.
Mexico's economy is doing well, the results that are owed to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is prey to a drug war that has already cost the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Mr. Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Bureau earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the American President, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populous and tentacular state that entangles the capital. On its land of predilection, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A Direct Man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises attribute to it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, an important improvement has been made to these roads, once bogged down and full of crevasses.
Plates bearing his name are hung outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to put in place lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and the party of M Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy, in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was evicted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of the Olvera Congress admits that after 12 years spent outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticism of opponents who blame the new president for lacking charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he can listen.
However, this is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more striking.
Hidden under the motorways, it is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, soldiers were called to rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighbourhood, and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a disaster area, dozens of women have been killed in the past two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place sadly famous for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
The detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to stop the problem of murders against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality in front of it.
In a concrete house, typical of this depraved area, Irinea Buendia struggles to retain her tears when she shows me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version mentions a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Mrs Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the body stiffness was already started.
While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross where the word "Justice" appears.
However, this is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old maid, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want us to accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has made a promise that he will prioritize it during his term of office.
"I hope he will be as good as president as when he was governor," said Olvera, Congressman in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter Bradley Manning's claims of ill-treatment during detention.
The trial concerns Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning's sequestration took place in extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the biggest leak of confidential information in the entire history of the U.S. military -- missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Maj. Ashden Fein stated that weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months in detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints regarding his treatment.
Cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion requiring that the Manning case be closed on the grounds that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- occurred one day after Manning testified that he wanted to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
At the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after meeting Manning, during his detention in Quantico Military Prison, where he was subjected to maximum solitary confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment his guards had given him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had had in prison was "very professional."
The forms do not mention any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had verbally expressed concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the problems mentioned.
"They wrote "no problem" (after addressing the concerns), and yet it did not mean that I had not raised any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they had assigned this restrictive status to him -- a level below close surveillance for the risk of suicide -- for the protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was fine, and I wanted to be removed from this status... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the Corps of Marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and fainted once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he had not been kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were mattresses, blankets, tongs, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or lying down during the day was contrary to the regulations.
Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for the treatment of Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his Thursday testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the appeal.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had deduced from the order of his guard that he should let go of his cover which could have hidden his nakedness, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let go.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, as he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his briefs or tongs to hurt himself, but that he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, tongs, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he experienced during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is to be convicted before a court martial, a trial that should be held early next year.
The defence stated that Manning intends to plead guilty to the least serious crimes and to fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, illegal publication of Internet information, and transmission of national defence information.
If all charges are held, he or she will be subject to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that the Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for the "Mexicans" ("Mexicoans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stayed still for several seconds, not knowing what line I was heading for.
I grew up in central California, where I was called the Mexican all my life.
It's an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my Boston friends use when they say they're "Irish," or my New York friends when they say they're "Italian."
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that my grandfather was born, there was no need for special qualification or a union trait.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to manage an interview in either language.
But I don't have a native's vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed for the "Foreigner" line.
I thought about it at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama, the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their preferred themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risking themselves in the United States.
He wishes to join the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give in writing half of their territory at the tip of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and no minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans violate their neighbour's sovereignty.
And Montezuma's kids are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that which the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a relative or a grandparent, did not find any opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- dark, uneducated skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream that we are living, and not that of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We give it to the United States.
Moreover, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not love us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they cough us up as if we were individuals of inferior strain and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we wouldn't find ourselves stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans are more strongly claiming their identity and Mexican Americans are upset about it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels that she is part of two countries.
In addition, many Mexican Americans I know don't seem to be part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little bit more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexican Americans to work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a beautiful country that we must absolutely visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the inequalities in wages, corruption and drug-related violence that are pervasive, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to take care of yourself, fellas.
It's normal.
While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way in which they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican Americans always want to do so in the way in which their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is futile.
While the same futile arguments persist to know who started, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; over 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be blocked in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has all been blown up, and whether we want it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there is every reason to think that this could help them to get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that doesn't make any losers or winners
At first glance, optimism seems difficult.
Although the ceasefire granted on 21 November continues, this week's fighting has strengthened the supporters of force on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will be proud to have forced the Israelis to abandon, even though Gaza has been crushed.
Having killed some of its leaders and turned down the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the world, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken the lead in Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members are jubilant and say that the Islamist croissant curves around Israel, from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hizbollah militia exercises its domination, through Syria, where the Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and even Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populated and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily relying on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor who can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of the hard line of Israel will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put back in the box.
The Iron Dome missile interception system has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of leading the last wave of violence.
But above all, Israel prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although the rocket fire in Gaza has killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide bombings, including the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to spread despite their illegality in international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more belligerent party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, has the beautiful part.
Why do you smite these Palestinian bastards by giving them a state?
If they were running the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out of the head.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will win it; but it may be that the Arab spring changes it.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to tackle problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a cease-fire that's good luck -- and could mark the start of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a dustbin that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a little like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with an assignment of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
A small and short-term hope is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now strive to put an end to the flow of weapons to Gaza, like Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo-state in the United Nations.
Obama also has an interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very clumsy vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital challenge for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packages came into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law that came into force in Australia is a world premiere, logos and colours have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific pictures of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the most stringent tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% chances that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers stated that this would boost the black market trade, which would make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
"Derious consequences will arise from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others stated that the Act had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarette cases, especially silicone to hide the horrible packaging, has increased sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost to the high court of Australia.
Ha said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only problem, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV advertising, sports sponsorship and the obligation for resellers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and have only a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the most important place," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of certain Lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has given himself the pain of making a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry focuses on the new regulations in place rather than on marketing.
Industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I don't know about them.
"You take a cigarette and put the package away," said Victor El Hage when he bought a package on which a picture of a tumor in his mouth appears.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna get arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on shelves.
"Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government had only to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising our arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to think about the issue of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is rather boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not forgetting the duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts specializing in the development of the child praise the boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even nourish creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the open-armed boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll be right back.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The trouble goes back a long way," he says.
On the walls of Pompei are Latin graffiti that evokes boredom, dating back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists of "wanting to do something, but not getting into a satisfactory activity."
What differentiates the boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though he or she would like it.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
The boredom can be strongly like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be linked, people who get bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, coming from the next room, the too loud sound of a TV show that had no report, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you are trying to focus on a difficult or taking task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "like looking at objects on an assembly chain, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when we are torturing or gritting, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to remain physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay unmoved," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
In order to measure this, researchers developed a "Disposal Scale for Trouble" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, "Among the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and in particular need numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasphemed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of adolescents reported getting bored at school and during homework at home, while 23 percent reported getting bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether today's boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: Is trouble good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The trouble is the way the brain found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn't always know what the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't have learned to take care of himself or self-regulating, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant brothing generated by activities and technology is the goal to which we should strive.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frantic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate the stopping times.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it is difficult to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directives for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a student in a university and a football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his condition: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the Kansas border, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons to appear for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his consumption - minor offences, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is it one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the Colorado vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana use have been classified without further action.
Police agencies have ceased to charge adults aged 21 and over for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana stores in their neighbourhoods.
"Things are evolving so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora's chief of police, east of Denver.
The regulatory bodies of the State of Washington are also asking themselves a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a licensing system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether we want it or not, is ahead of most states in the area of marijuana regulation, first with regard to therapeutic use and now with regard to personal use.
" Colorado has a more regulated market and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith admits, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves," he said.
The Washington Act, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a legal vacuum of one year, during which the permit system will still not exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
In the meantime, practical issues remain outstanding: how to balance the state's mandate that guarantees adequate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales shops within a radius of 30 km around a school, park, playground or nursery.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis sales trade, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the Cannabis Legalization Centre, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City actorney" (representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office) would no longer prosecute persons aged 21 and over who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop accusing persons for this type of "immediate effect" crime.
Chief Oates stated that the police would apply the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that they would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, Northern Colorado, the "Attorney District" (Procurer of the Republic), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, mainly in order to pressure users to get detoxified.
At present, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those persons who committed an offence that, at the time of the incident, was a recognized offence," Buck said.
Reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the restricted consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer produce adults for possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the County Public Prosecutor's Office, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to proceed with all cases of marijuana detention.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for personal marijuana consumption is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials with regard to the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the Public Prosecutor's Office, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing people accused of marijuana consumption and speaking as local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent much of their lives prosecuting people who used marijuana, too, have difficulty accepting it as legal," he said.
As the first states to deal with the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are now becoming a case of case law for the legalization of drugs.
While defenders and state officials are planning a new legalized sales border, they are anxiously awaiting federal government directives, which still design marijuana sales and cultivation as federal crimes.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients with therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has mainly allowed marijuana sales for therapeutic purposes to operate in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are probably not going to push the doors to seize small bags of drugs, there is a strong bet that it opposes the licensed retail sale of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political advisor to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado did not wait for federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales, even if this is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a six-month moratorium, and it is expected that this ban will be imposed next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the State.
Many questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was misled and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not only today's students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was a prominent place for me to know, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheatre that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were disconcerted.
The L'Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson stated with facétie that I had left after having been forced to drink in sliced cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been intimidated and subjected to constant bullying.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, not because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one single reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowing, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative Party supporter.
Why are you talking about this today, you'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of centre-right students suffer the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, along with those of gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College's Student Hall (JCR) stated that they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted" because of their political opinions.
They want there to be a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Country of Wonders: Young, Smart and Right"), devoted to student politics, and which portrayed "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
This included student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moves in Rolls-Royce, has a silver-plated complete and moves with a chrome-plated head cane.
In other universities, conservative students claim to be treated as scapegoats for the introduction of increased tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says that such a climate is "unfortunate", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, President of the OUCA, says that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are center-right.
"This constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one who thought that way in my first few weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, then I was 18 years of age and of paralysing shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted against granting Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was full of Stalinic vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students met with others and teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen afterwards.
I found out that not only were teachers involved in sarcasm towards Tory students, but they also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on strikers, privatization and government opposition to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was engraved in the wood of classrooms.
The first sarcasm of which I was a victim concerned a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "Please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pussulous face, easily got away.
"Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he said.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and then I felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student of English studies, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OAU.
"I know who you are," he said, kindly.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservator) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most young Torys claim to be Labour (workers).
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
This ploy failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political and economic science who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took over the refrain.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I have only been able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after nightfall?
Should I have become Labour and denied my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only teacher openly Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a Conservative, but also because he was an external policy advisor to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his adherence to the Marxist-determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a position as a professor at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started sailing between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded urban friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was unbelieving.
During his studies in Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he pathetically told me.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreamy bells.
Even my communist friends had irreproachable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a work session conducted the following week, when another professor of history suggested the most serious in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Internally embarrassing, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and treated them as "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who dug the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed undercover in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers dropped out.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can call me a wet, whiny chicken.
But no 18-year-old child should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys an unshakeable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame "
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian seamstress.
Somerset House, the former residence of Élisabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The seamstress recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high-couture models created for his sewing house over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he declared with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the hub of a story whose only protagonist is "the lord" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its famous customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino presents his personal memories like the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest seamstress of the city of Voghera, to the north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving kingship.
"At least they don't crush their cigarette megots on your gorgeous carpet like some pop music stars do," said Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his Gstaad chalet," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate friend of beauty of the past like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, also did not forget the costumer's charism.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Place d'Spain in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated", recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the week of the Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never go out of fashion, because its creations are works of art," she concludes.
Nobile line parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He likes well-bred people and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a 60-metre wide glamorous podium that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to parade on the podium to admire a "public" of dream wearing the main creations of Valentino, like the tailor that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
Among these model audiences are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the seamstress in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the Fall-Winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift he had given me," said Naty Abascal, one of the seamstress's museums.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimes our beauty," adds Feria's former Duchess.
I really like the colors he uses, they're bright and they illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Nor can Princess Patricia della Giovanpaola d'Arenberg forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of being the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a flying skirt, a draped buster and a neckline to fall off.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodriguez d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timeless," explains the Italian aristocracy who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the night dresses of the seamstress with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also all the memories she conveys".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition of Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her marriage with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "gagazze" (the seamstress thus calls his seamstresses) to make this dress in ivory silk with pearl inlays, twelve kinds of different laces and a four-and-a-half-metre drag.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high seam of the end of the twentieth century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Stunned for years by the "knowledge-being" of nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any husband of his clients.
"Its refinement, its calmness, its refined and perfect appearance have always jumped in my eyes," admits Arenberg.
Last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says so...
The hardest trade in the world: Kawah Ijen's human mules
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through the steep stone trails.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their lives by carrying the sulphur of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas from the earth's guts solidifies in contact with the air.
After collecting large sulphur rocks, which weigh about 70 kilos in total, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There are only 250 meters up to the peak of the volcano that culminates at 2,386 meters of altitude, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a turtle-like angle, keeping balance and measuring their steps to not stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who fell mortally in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents of euro for each kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once at the top, there is a path between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and carrying the heavy baskets painfully, they walk the 3 kilometers up to the balance that a mining company has installed a bit underground at 1,850 meters of altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents euro) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to 10,000 rupees (83 cents euro) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (EUR 3.8) on each trip," says Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes 3 hours and ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would gain in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)", says the porter who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life defying the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases released by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This friendly, intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy wooden mask with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur does not stop rising at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not touch a sub of 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) of increase per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protestes Madrusin, a 42-year-old body carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for 30 years, since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which are obviously added their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pains in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, his companions and him extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers from there by a goat trail invaded by weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik, opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, 30 years of age, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but the perpetual misery from generation to generation one of the most difficult trades in the world: the one made by the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are responsible for this lack of children on career, stress and the cost of access to property.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, we fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem improbable that these words come from an advertisement for mint pastilles, but despite that, or perhaps thanks to that, the video spread like a powder trail on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
Words come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polychinel in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill "their national duty."
It is only intended for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that it was a theme that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes to pheromones or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we said the following: what more creative way to solve this problem than to make it a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government does not take it so lightly.
It spends US$1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriage and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, in accordance with its national population distribution, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he found himself above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, says that this is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities, beyond marriage and family formation," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and delayed marriage and birth, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration in order to counter the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound with barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against Chinese people who are accused of raising wages downwards and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore has had its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem by introducing higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it began to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "footwear boxes", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company EL Developers, claims that his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger housing.
They are more popular, in the sense that these houses are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer instructions to promoters, who were previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state city.
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate by discussing with Singaporeans working in the centre's financial district, it would seem that they are not going to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that's why people bring it back later," says a young man.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, it is important to be able to dispose of my money and my time," says another young man of about twenty years old.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is about the quality of the private domain or "the field of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is in the private domain for children under 16 years of age?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he exposes himself by spreading on the Internet events that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriodico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" in personal terms and "the password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
"I will not reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post nice images or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I won't share one of my pictures or someone who would be an idiot," he said.
The young boy admits that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked people, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine subscribers on Twitter.
Most of them are family.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I simply post them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends quickly," he says.
He claims that he would never accept an unknown person's request.
Nor will he trust someone who would recommend a foreigner to him.
The case of José, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"It doesn't concern me because we have something in common, for example, music," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made advances to him or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today under the name of cyberharassment are not foreign to the young boy.
A close friend of mine was raided on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only passed it in a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cyberharassment," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information but, with the emergence of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Digital Natives and Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives, they, children and young people, were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are learning ourselves," she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or say at an age where they do not have the maturity to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective while what matters most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
"They say not to do it is useless," she says.
Then Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a foreigner, why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a picture of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish on you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"Times on the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary teacher and education advisor, states that it is essential that parents consciously read the conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have solid foundations to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that it is not necessary to speak to foreigners.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be released after the summit was closed, and then stated that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian government's website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information about the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The limited information circulated among journalists was provided by the press officers of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more important information.
Later, the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South American Arab Summit (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although requested by the press, it had not issued the declaration also known as the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited the availability of information to a maximum extent.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague which breaks a different border between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and stated that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleadings of both parties in Lima's trial against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we are bringing before this international court today," said President Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," added President Piñera, giving a hand to President Humala, next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit itself to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The agent read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries would put in place "significant steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that action would be taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve access to medicines, low-cost Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to anticipate a better future for our populations," said President Humala.
"We have decided to focus on a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide further details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow for its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaragua counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We're going to revise all these ways, they're not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that's going to ask for a discussion with that country," he said.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," said President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City where they planned to attend the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the context of the Summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the Sixth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Péru, that Europeans "had been entertained during the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but they were now almost a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by the Unasur member countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador expressed support for the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who come back to our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we South Americans have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but instead he respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected".
In addition, he criticizes Swedish justice, which demanded that he submit to an interrogation of an alleged sexual offence on his territory, while "Swedish legislation itself allows for this to be done by videoconferencing, which could be done since Ecuador's Embassy in London".
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian President.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It works on the health of anyone," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be the award of a safe-conduct to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and stresses that he has had discussions in London to find a solution to the closure of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón has launched a whole series of proceedings with different European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain gave the safe-driving as soon as tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as permitted by its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith, and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malevolent or perverse politicians but the bad journalists at the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that this was not the type of journalist "either the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue the path and to chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto over Paraguay in Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and attempted coup d'état disguised", because in reality, "this destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this judgment is not being respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to move forward together.
They must be solved as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the proper resolution of the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that "it is beneficial for Latin America to bring international proceedings if both countries agree to accept such a firm judgement".
Referring to the possibility of his nomination as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to fight for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 primary, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, power has never interested me, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this possible victory, but we must accept that responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose, I'll do it too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just discussed with Venezuelan vice president Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a decline in President Chávez's state of health," he commented.
Ecuador's Head of State participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: HIV positive.
"It was as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful" in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to learn about it and his strenuousness was such that he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he met in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigmas.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because he was speechless."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG head of HIV unit Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes as his reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of exposure of the immune system presented by patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for non-drug users: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those with a CD4 rate of 500.
To speak simply, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, "as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age," the scientist asked.
In order to put this progress in its context, it is important to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of AIDS-related deaths has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients reported on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
Then why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
In at least the last 12 years, we have never missed drugs, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know they are infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to carry out earlier diagnoses and, for this, it is necessary to propose screening tests in a massive way, to all those who ask for it".
The specialists and members of the State AIDS Prevention Council of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who had to take his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done so and despite his young age, he was already carrying AIDS and suffering from the sarcoma of Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better if I shine three times a week," they say, "it's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my drugs.
To date, his parents only know that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active but co-responsible sex life, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day march.
Let them take the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, Guadalajara journalist who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the greatest is prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given hundreds of packets, it is very good, but it results, that still today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", posed with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, says the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at the counters, but are found in the public toilet distributors and in the places that young people frequent.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor was it a question of paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had said when asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"It's not how sexuality works, it's best to provide condoms to people already sexually active," he said.
The figures in Jalisco
A total of 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) were reported.
The State is the 4th State of the country in number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of the contamination is done by sex, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each recorded case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a United States court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a bad precedent for all national companies with branches in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
It therefore appears that the survival procedures of Mexican law-authorized societies are not valid in the country at the starry banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the coup d'état to the judgment rendered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the northern Texas district leaves Mexican companies defenceless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's main glass manufacturer to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case states that creditors must register under the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeal Court, serving in New Orleans, states that the main proceedings are formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
Indeed, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-corporate vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro's subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
Here there are about half a dozen examples, among them Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy had guaranteed debts.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in all ways the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, i.e. the "vautour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been taken by 45 votes to 37.
Data omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he had encountered since 2008 without halting the severe economic crisis faced by the United States, affecting the country's costs.
For the time being, the Gonzalez Sada family society will appeal to the same court of appeal for the full vote, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The remedy of insurance will demand non-prosperity and requires the review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious thing is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") detailing Vitro's proceedings under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that this freed him from the conventions signed by both countries to bring him to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, the Committee notes that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-part carambolage: they haunt Vitro and they haunt the country.
General summary
The complaints of the Mexican Aviation Society's unions against the former employer of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were silenced for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviadores has already encountered problems.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the trust F/589 of bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Administration of Hotels.
As everyone knows, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're watching the Dragon Mart.
Gathered at the end of the week in an amphitheatre at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the South-East zone in order to oppose the monumental project that is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
The government has highlighted a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA's English acronym, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already in ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was well that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is my whole life"
The globe-trottor of the basketball "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, traveled all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as big as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage sentenced him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, national basketball team player, national team manager and leader, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I wore several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, director general of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalls during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Ballball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his unusual route, bear witness to it.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, those he most fond of are those who remind him of his passing as a player in the Váqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"It was my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros Championships from 1967 onwards, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has been a great many years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the NSB team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over the team," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a tough player for you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it?"
That's how to start Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gauss would help us try to win another championship.
He was pleased with the Vaqueros championship with Gaussius, but only remotely since he was already the great manito of the federation in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of Mincy's and Mincy's duties on the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympian tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn't made us play the last game, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is that of the Pan American Games of Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and put a beating on the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that may not be the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympian tournament in Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner in place of players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
Without a doubt, this is Piculin Ortiz.
His statistics at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Piculin did.
And that without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues he played for.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
To have been part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s the NSB had up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys play only in their area and face only teams from other corners of the island during national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
At least I saw the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, watch basketball games.
And of course, I take advantage of the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas), became known worldwide by the leading role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied an unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of cancer complications, according to a family release sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his dear home town of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved the most again," the family said.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who interpreted her wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said her press attaché, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I'm gonna miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived life in full," Gray said in a statement.
The doctors had diagnosed a liver cirrhosis with Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had recognized that he had drunk a lot for many years.
In 1995, he had been detected with a malignant liver tumor and had been transplanted.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary guy in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two comedies that remained short of time in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles at the cinema are roles well received by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in an episode of November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had brought together 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reason to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man, but with a charismatic smile: an dishonest entrepreneur and an infidel husband who was trying to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as a man "great, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is in progress, informed the chain.
For the time being, neither Warner nor TNT have communicated how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who knew the fame with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the scenes of the New York theatres in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R.'s merciless memoirs)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt anyone or affect him in any way," he told the press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist troubled patients.
"I advise them, I give them back confidence, I come with them when they come for surgery and then," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them some comfort, like "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's gonna be okay."
He has also been a tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a lecture on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hook: the end of the "great count" of the Maya calendar, on December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal gulf that some have nicknamed "the Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end of time thought that the apocalypse would be triggered.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé to his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to teach on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker provides the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guides a certain human conduct.
If nuclear weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to teach again, in case the world does not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students any choice but to work "until the very night of the end of the supposed world," said Restall.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
"It was completed in two hours," said Restall about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who were asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at the University of Rutgers-Camden.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and infirmary, claims to have watched all apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone one teacher, told us to believe in the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Maya prophecy, and somehow we discredited it," says Julie Zegle, a senior student in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it's only a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is an anxiety linked to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, which causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to the growth of these speculations.
"In other places in the world, people don't think about it," he says.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that there were classes here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years, we have talked about the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophically about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us that they thought they'd go to "end of the world" parties.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
