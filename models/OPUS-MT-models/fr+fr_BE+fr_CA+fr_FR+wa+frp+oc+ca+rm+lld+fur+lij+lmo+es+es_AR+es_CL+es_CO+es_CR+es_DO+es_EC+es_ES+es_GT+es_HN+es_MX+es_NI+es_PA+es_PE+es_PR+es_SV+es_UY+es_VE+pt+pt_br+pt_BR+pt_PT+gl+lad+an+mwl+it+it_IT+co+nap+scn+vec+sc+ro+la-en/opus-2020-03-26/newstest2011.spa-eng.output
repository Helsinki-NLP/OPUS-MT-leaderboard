The ČSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or the pastry shop.
The new councillors of the ČSSD in the capital will apparently have to overcome the obvious language barriers for the members of the Prague Board and the City Council to understand their renewed comrades of the ODS.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the slang-marked language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary that used Prague's flower and political nata during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors almost do not understand these well-known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is, I don't know."
"I'm more of a novice in politics," said Culture Councillor Lukáš Kaucký during the "collegeo" terminology exam.
And as far as the political veteran was concerned, Karel Březina reacted equally.
Maybe they know the concept of golf.
"Possibly it's the only expression of all that you've asked me what I use from time to time."
"If not, normally I don't use slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions published the Aktuálně.cz newspaper last June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial board selected six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the Prague municipal authorities.
Socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", "go to the pastry shop", "the bull's nose", "the betrayal of the capital" and "bridging".
Three councillors agreed to take the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague in the future, initially agreed, but did not take the phone back.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolinek, refused directly to do so.
"I don't get into these things and I don't think I'm going to appreciate the fun of civic democrats."
"What I do care about is how we will understand ourselves in the implementation of our programs," he said.
As has been seen, Councilor Lukáš Kaucký reportedly did not realize that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former mayor Bem, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" does not say anything; the only term he reached in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, who immediately adds: "But I know more about the news."
"I'm going to have to point to a language course," he joked.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf hole the Blanka tunnel, but also the environmental councillor Lukáš Plachý.
Later, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý really are, even know where to find that character; moreover, they suspect the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; it is soon unveiled to Plachý that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janoušek.
Like Březina, it indicates that such knowledge obtained them from the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among the socio-democrats.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really looks like we have nothing like it."
"Moreover, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or play word games with names," says ČSSD's president pray, Petr Hulinský, whose partymates call Hulda.
"At school they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my classmates also call me that," says their own nickname Karel Březina.
Aktuálně.cz tested the name and works.
For his party mates, Weinert is Děda (like "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they partnered before the election deceiving the party's sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igráček" ("playmobil") from some of his comrades.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in speaking within the party.
Hulinský does not like to be called Hulda, but Aktuálně.cz has discovered even other nicknames for this president to pray.
"The Doctor of the Rights of the Bastards" seems to recall that Petr Hulinský obtained his PhD in Law at Bratislava Police Academy.
Government wants to limit the torture of "witches," as published in a brochure
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually old, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
The women who "return" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men rarely suffer such a sin."
"It also isolates healthy young women, because they help in the work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of the state of West Africa Burkina Faso, takes care of a special residence of over 100 women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
It issued an information brochure that should help to avoid witch hunting.
However, this has a stick.
"More than 70 per cent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," says the newspaper Die Standard on the disadvantages of written awareness.
The accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week, when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a miserable cumulum of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was caught in the oil that is used for ritual anointings.
He set on fire when the group wanted to "expulsion of the evil spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of the "witches" supports it people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "Human soul eaters have always been a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government was trying to appease witch hunting, the President had still participated in it in the Gambia last year.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt that allegedly had been related to his death and had tried to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To help him, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, forced men and women randomly chosen from the Gambian peoples to the property of the president in Kanilai," says Amnesty International in his report.
In the farm, the arrested persons had to drink a pot of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that also caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay at the farm.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand people in detention.
Bakala's tenant: heats up with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The man, old and old, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal magnet" Zdeÿek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried documents with the new three-storey lease contracts: his, his daughter's and his son's, who is serving his sentence.
All three of them just caught up in the rental liberalisation.
Instead of 3,500 Czech kroner per month, the child will pay from next year 4100 kroner for a two-room apartment with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in his son's new contract, on which he has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains half angry, half resigned.
BytyOKD.cz civil association, which described new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants not sign new contracts and wait until 7 December, when they will publish a guide informing them of how to proceed in these cases.
But, before this, man only makes an ademan.
"Everything he says," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a major testing laboratory for liberalization.
After New Year it will happen with the vast majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
That's why Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
RPG's mining waiting room is one of the four of Ostrava's and, on Tuesday at nine o'clock, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to take number.
"Rental 2011", can be read on a bright button on your touch screen.
When you press it, a piece of paper comes out of the machine with a number.
Almost no time to read "157" and already the number appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Soon after, an elderly marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rents.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as old times: settlement requests, insurance issues and similar issues.
Letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the boxes of tenants of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty offers you in the cards an increase in rent from 15 to 38%.
On November 18 a special window is opened in the customer service center for new rentals.
"It's been working for a week, so it's starting," responds, after briefly doubting, the workers who find themselves in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and the old floors for Bakala miners are the most delicate topics in the area.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, treated them loud and clear, and now appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
"I didn't even get changed by the damn bathroom dish," the man mentioned in the introduction was evicted.
According to workers, at the moment they come more than retired to check if they get a discount on the rent if they sign in time, as promised by RPG's special offer.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before 15 December will also receive half of the discount on the February rental.
However, the window of mining "liberalization" certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about the rent in 2011 about forty or fifty people," estimates the employee of the window.
In the meantime, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach agreement on the rent, an independent judge will have to settle the matter.
"It's not a threat, it's information about the only possible and complete way of proceeding according to the law," RPG warns on his pages.
"No one is going to be judged here," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man on the street in front of the customer service centre gives him, at least in part, the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to court," he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns you in the media not to sign, so maybe people wait," he says.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in the majority of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rents still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for the owners, the main reason to increase the rent.
While during the five years that passed between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen that hangs from the ceiling, in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that stand out in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of the properties of RPG."
"In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech kronor per square metre per month," is indicated on the screen.
Just increase by 38% the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 kroner per square metre," says RPG.
On 2,600 floors, the rental will remain invariable next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not affect rents at any rate, but will climb from four to eight years.
In addition, he adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rental rise (see chart) back on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the lease raise agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need day care
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would say that he also hides in his interior a small nursery with all the same to such installations: walls of colors, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outside terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design's employees can come to her.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, of which numerous well-known buildings came out of Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-guard.
In the company they work about 90 people, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, day care is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers to its workers within the framework of its social program.
The builders and architects thus have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of the children.
Miniguardy was an idea of Arch's own employees.Designu and, with the support of management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-guardy is financed through the European Social Fund under the operational programme for human resources and employment, as well as the Czech state budget.
Thanks to the funding granted (a total of more than 2.8 million Czech kroner) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When you exhaust the funding (two years), Arch.Design has an obligation to keep the mini-guardry running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and in the submission of the application for funding contributed the company Economy Rating.
The care of the children is in the hands of qualified staff; moreover, a nurse and a teacher of the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care. The nursery currently accommodates children without a limit of age, although most of them are under three years old.
Since it is a "ministry", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible in order to adapt to the needs of the parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the enterprise.
Although it is a matter of individual education and care, the contents of the mini-care programme are comparable to the regular pre-school education programme.
In it children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach to English.
The class not only has toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of collecting late school children when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a loyalty relationship between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design stands among the companies sign that they offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened the marketing of personnel.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Observe Gaudí's interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remind the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its shape similar to a skeleton, the locals nicknamed it "the house of the bones".
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade that recalls the scales and the ubiquitous lines gently curved, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with oniric lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
By paying more attention, there is a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought-out order.
At night, the whole facade of the house seems even more impressive, since it is lit so that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Snake and the twisting of forms continues to surprise us also inside.
The corrugated wood copies the frames of the windows, the railings, the ornaments of the doors, the mirrors and the signboards.
The Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gracia, emerged from the remodeling of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of making a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Casa Batlló, made up of several apartments, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He collaborated in the design of the architect Josep María Jujol.
In fact, in its plans of the project appeared ornaments for the apartment representative of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade.
In the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and the Güell de Gaudí park, where other pieces of it are found.
Due to its organic form, the locals shortly after its completion nicknamed it "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific opening mechanism of the windows, began to call it "the house of the bostizos".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, the sword of San Jorge, patron of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the central heating period with ventilating vents and typical fireplaces.
It may be strange his inclination of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not comply at all with the rules of construction of the moment and was not allowed to influence them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although obviously in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the town hall was so impacted with the result that it requested that it be corrected.
He was disturbed, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather on the contrary: just fifteen days after the City Council's request, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two upper floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery of the second floor there was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-storey house is completely crossed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform were to break all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the lounges and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, not only gained a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles covering the inner courtyard and skylights.
The game with both colors brings the maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which instead absorb the sun's rays.
Anyone can visit the Batlló House, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and charged apartment of those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and expanded the visits to the common area and the gutter, including the roof terrace.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16,50 euros, although students, retirees and tourist card holders get a 20% discount.
The amount significantly exceeds the price of entry of other Gaudí buildings into the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly become friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose mattress and ground: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really confers its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the ground.
First of all, they must be complementary to perfection so that they can be adapted to specific users.
During the election numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, state of health and gender of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and ground are located is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they often weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them more frequently.
If the central canals are not properly aired and above, they are on a firm basis, they keep the humidity inside. Moth can even appear below.
When choosing a bed, they also influence customs.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad, often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower and hard surface.
"Almost all hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep equally well here."
"For his crushed shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes that time nervous system problems, so they get poorly information from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL player anymore to be able to appreciate viscoelastics.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimizes your stiffness and shape depending on the absorbed heat or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not spin like after a hard game.
She just sleeps better.
Viscoelastics also works as protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of its feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example single rooms, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when you lie face-to-face, you should have your hands comfortably clutched towards the elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert from Cechu čalouníkå to dekoratérå, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, a subject taught in specialized schools for many years.
In double rooms, each needs its own mattress and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to assemble the sommers at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with inside springs a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to shapes and softness.
"By touching it with your hand or settling on the mattress, you should definitely not notice the docks," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a specific type of ground.
The fully padded bedrooms, where the mattress and the base are like siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can't wash your case, which today is often done.
And since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even of a lifetime guarantee.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, sellers give advice: in mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully take care of the cleaning and washing of the case, but better add a mattress protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although mattress covers with zip closure are currently made throughout their perimeter, so when opening them they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling in the larger models (and for one person only) when lifting the mattress may seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a ground floor, do you have a firm table?
Never!
At least a lot for beds designed to spend one night visiting.
However, it must make (if you don't already have them) ventilation holes on the table and it must be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-jointable sheeting and containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fiber) can be used, although it is always better a base with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar zone are reinforced and their stiffness can be regulated.
Jointable sheet sommers should not be used with a spring mattress, as they do not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the blades, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special fastening of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "round" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men with very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
Even the manufacturers of mattresses who, in the "male", began to use a softer area just around their shoulders remember them.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are sommers with cross or board structure with so-called multi-torsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is reduced.
It should also take into account that, although using the appropriate mattress and mattress, if using a bad pillow (large and "mullid"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the same can be relaxed.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the sole with shoulder reinforcement or the softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do, apparently, with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, increasingly, natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is produced, are filled with natural oils, e.g. castor or soy.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soy.
"Biologically, in the case of mattresses, it means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also choose microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with brisa vegetable extracts, so that the mattress bottom absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "heat" the bottom.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel more warmth.
The favourites at the moment?
Cold foam mattresses, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, make them more permeable than normal polyurethane mattresses and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold foam and viscoelastic rigidities allows the manufacture of mattresses from various areas that know perfectly well where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have lower VAT, since they are considered as health means.
The first one to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's complicated to save on mattresses and somieres.
Sometimes you can approve the offers of manufacturers or sellers, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory foam attached to the case by 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained free of charge.
The era of viscoelastics with an open cell structure and a great density began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
Initially it emerged as a material for NASA, because during the take-off the astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is used not only in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, such as pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and similar.
More and more parents use tracking devices to control their children
Fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device has the approximate size of a matchbox, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were afraid of the missing Anička case and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We all try to tell ourselves that it is not about spying, but about another way to reduce the chances of a tragedy," considers Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are put in someone's purse without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In their view, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns about the fact that if the child does not want to take him, he will simply throw him away.
"Even younger children show great creativity in intentionally losing certain things if they want to prevent them from being controlled."
"Before, parents trusted the mobiles enormously, but they could be switched off as easily as the tracking device," says Bočková.
In your opinion, it is questionable whether in the event of an attack such a device is really useful.
"If it is a prepared abduction, the author will almost always check whether the child has any kind of electronic device that can reveal his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices is expanding, it will also look for them, since their sale will certainly be carried out with a lot of publicity."
"In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers follow-up services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is destroyed immediately, its presence can help.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a given period."
"If you suffer damage, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person concerned."
"The most expensive devices include a tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and remains motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Čech.
In your opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smart mobile phones with navigation, where only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that for the time being they are devices with a size similar to a box of matches or smaller mobile phones.
They can therefore be lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, for this reason tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a possible aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or identify it after a while, which can make the police buy time," he adds.
Although tracking devices are carried on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the check of the position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough tricks to surround the entire Czech Republic, but only two years long.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of fuse to arrest explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense added to its arsenal 224 kilometers of fuse.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the fuse is two years, four at the most.
The army bought the explosive fuse from the STV Group, a.s. for forty million kroner.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mesh saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometers of mesh a year.
According to the army's pyrotechnic calculations, with which MF DNES was contacted, it is decided, however, that, in such a case, such maneuvers should be carried out with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high-ranking officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
Neither the Minister of Defence Alexander Vondr and the captain of the Vlastimil Picek army wanted exemptions.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to spend sixty kilometers of macha.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if so, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two meters of mesh, the army would have with the new purchase (including adding the consumption of engineering or special units) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally recently to Minister Vondra because they say they have little ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices are limited for money.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I can't understand that he's repeatedly buying us such quantities of wick."
"But it's your decision and you'll no doubt know why they're acting like this."
"For us, the army is a good customer that, as a company, we try to satisfy," admits STV Group commercial director Jan Děcký.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Defense Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of miles of mache by also saying that he will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký, from STV Group, indicates that the fuse only has a useful life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, of two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to the army's possible criticisms, does not want to give his name.
After the end of their useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometers of wick, it obtained a discount.
"It cost us 60 percent less than last year's order of 244 kilometers," says the spokesman Pejšek of the Ministry of Defence's shopping centre.
Just to compare: the annual mass consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate World War II ammunition or leave it by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 metres for years.
In addition, the police always ask only the fair amount to exhaust the ammunition before its useful life is over.
It was decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and, in addition, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of mesh can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in ending tens of thousands of tons of ammunition at the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years there will be the following problem with the current one: we will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old mesh, which is now being bought "barata".
So far I'm still living from the contacts I got from the contest.
Winning the "Empressor of the Year" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchises of his hotel.
The last edition won the contest "Empressor of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun de Liberec.
His success story seems to be taken from a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that in Liberec quality accommodation was needed at a good price.
With the savings he brought together with seasonal jobs abroad and a credit from the bank bought a house that was half-destroyed composed of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
"At present, the quality-price ratio of the accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He began renting the first floor rebuilt to foreign workers.
All the income he earned was invested back in the building, which gradually turned into a 54-bedroom pension.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he gradually managed to open in Liberec four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisse, to which we sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," said the number one businessman last year.
"To this sale of hotel opening licenses greatly helped to win the 'Empressor of the Year' competition," adds grateful Pytloun.
Victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and around.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
Without a doubt, it recommends to everyone that they want to try a company that participates in the competition.
But it considers that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live from contacts and acquaintances that, without the competition, he may not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I have started to collaborate regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
in total about seventy.
"I've seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that has gained general recognition."
"It is not, much less, my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of the entire team."
"Only my name appears on the front page," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we've had in Farmet.
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already gone through the worst.
The owner of the Farmet company, Karel Žěárský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone contest "Company of the Year", last year at the "Slava House" in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to convert a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence in fighting competition," says last year's winner.
Farmet's story begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel Žěárský's father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the embargo of properties during communism, it did not hesitate much; he resigned his position in the company in which she worked and, with a couple of companions, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later, they became the largest automatic press manufacturer in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialized public after reaching success in the media competition.
"Not only did our customers start to consider the Farmet brand as much better, but foreign partners also began to value collaboration with a company that was most successful in their country," says Karel Žēarský.
Last year maybe it wasn't at Farmet just a sample of the euphoria of victory.
It also gained recognition for commercial results until 2008 and, in part, 2009.
And just 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, of course, do not get rid of such a situation."
"The revenues were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some layoffs," explains Karel Žěárský.
A viable company must sometimes take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company's profits, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened the presence on the international market and obtained magnificent valuations at national fairs," says Žěárský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žěárský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous standards
The Absurdez survey of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He's already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than one third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the administration of social security requested an extract from the business register, although its officials can obtain it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of social security will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial register when it carries out a check on the taxes of the insured," said ČSSZ spokesman Jana Burańová.
The objective of the Absurdez survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations that businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year forms for the fourth time part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and begins to create affection also among the general public.
While last year's edition was attended by 3,000 voters, this year it reached almost four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have a number of legal obligations that need to be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in number of roles necessary for tax reporting we are in the first place worldwide," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic is in position 74a, i.e. eight seats worse than last year.
The year's Absurdez competition was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated in the same way each year.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest selects seven candidates for the "anti-premio" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet via www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It gains the absurdity that receives the most votes.
For this year's survey more than one hundred were submitted, in particular 105 rules and regulations that do not make sense.
Examples were sent by both employers and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals this year is published on the page of the competition.
The announcement of the contest, which is always held in early November at Wenceslao Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic, attended this event.
"Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the state continually puts obstacles to entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate a minimum of thirty paragraphs each year that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in drunk water.
In 2007, what was most disturbing to people was the employer's obligation to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a post to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended second in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the work office by its foreign workers of work travel up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third one's gonna win.
The 2009 Absurdity was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a fridge and two floor scales.
This year, therefore, the Ministry of Health issued a communication stating that it had eliminated the obligation to have a fridge.
A new category recognizes socially responsible enterprises
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the contest of Hospodářské noviny is the category called Company responsible for the year 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way, we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of Vodafone, organiser and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel contest of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of Vodafone Company's 2010 main competition, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activity varies completely between the two, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, they are for example disabled persons, in other cases personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists throughout the Republic was, for example, the software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of funds to sponsor disabled children for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a stationery that is particularly concerned with the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the staff; therefore it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of Chechnya and in the contest Vodafone Company of the year ended third in the region.
In Olomouc he won the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also given because it primarily buys Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administration activities will have the least possible impact on the environment," says businesswoman Miluše Ryznarová.
The head IT company Enlogit of the region of Ústí also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports the work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Persona scholarship in troubles, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says the company representative Ondřej Suchý.
They are also in good place with a mention the laundry company Prani to čištění of the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that have an impact on their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transportation, improvement of skills and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, of Bruntál Czasch's construction company, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company contest of the year were automatically appointed who answered the questions of the registration form and sent it to the organizers before 15 August.
The organizers removed from the evaluation forms that were not complete or wrong.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the contest of Company responsible for the year, but are not disqualified from the contest "principal" Vodafone Company of the year."
"The individual candidatures for this competition are not allowed, since this is a subcategory of the company's main competition of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose consultancy.
Police arrested during a public auction in the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police carried out various arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed a local media businessman and real estate businessman Luboš G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the ground under consideration was received by a specific interested party.
He had to pay for it to Luboš G. half a million crowns.
"For the time being, I can only say that the police are looking for a bribed person during a public auction and public bidding," Právo said the Chief Attorney General of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the time being he cannot disclose any more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
The way in which it was able to influence the public auction, given the lack of official information, can only be speculated.
The spokesman for the Lubomíra Černá Agricultural Fund responded to Pravo's questions saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
"It's a customer, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Convocation for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the land law" and is carried out when a number of interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, offer a higher value than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the offers, the order of the buyers is determined, and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest offer," the Fund spokesman explained.
Luboš G. had information on who was to be presented for the call, and since he was both interested because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to the interested parties on the ground that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on him.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
He appeared in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund planned land for the construction of public infrastructure, particularly in the place where a large road should be built to the industrial area of Borská pole.
Then he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate by a house in the city's own historic center with a much higher value.
In this case, the town hall had to intervene because, if not, blocked land would avoid construction.
Families must pay an additional cost of several hundred kronor per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rentals.
As a result, families will have to remove several hundred crowns a month more than now from the portfolio, starting in January.
Electricity prices rise by 4.6 per cent, gas by about 2 per cent, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10 per cent more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should rise to about 100 crowns a year more than now.
However, major electricity suppliers reduced prices because of increased support for renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaics.
However, the gas is moderately increased, especially at the time when heating is most used and, therefore, the greater is consumption.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are increased throughout the country, the price change in central heating varies from place to place.
The rise in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay from January for central heating some 50 more crowns per month, while Liberec's families will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to bear an increase of 9% in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, the Pragians will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will increase by 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the rental prices of 450,000 flats rented in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the company ICC Byty, which owns in Ustí nad Labem about 2,500 floors, will increase the rent from January to 100%.
The company will take to the courts those who do not agree to the new rental.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase next year to 10%.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. Beer is no longer in shape, because it works slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers to end up in medical care at less than 15 years of age.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This derives from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get them drunk."
"Fashion is now the strong alcoholic beverages," says Pravo, the pediatric head of Hořovice Hospital in the center of Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they manage to take a bottle from their father from the alacenna, it may be whisky, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage that it is lightened with juice and that it doesn't smell so much," he explains.
The spokesperson for the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová, also confirms this.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use a caretaker they caught at home," added Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, they are 13- and 14-year-old drinkers who usually appear in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter maybe four times."
"It started at the age of twelve, when she was brought with 3.5 alcohol in her blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," says the department's doctor on this case.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother wasn't surprised that his daughter disappeared 48 hours," the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance for drinking on the part of their children that is considered to be the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
The experts point out that, in the case of children, one cannot speak properly of dependence.
"Alcohol means a person who has had a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with alcohol, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, rather it is due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelikán.
According to the spokesman Jurinová, this year at Motol's pediatric clinic, forty drunk children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, the statistics only show those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after the medical examination, go home with their parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply meet after school and drink attentively, there are three seasonal highs for Pelikán: the day of witches, the end of the year and the end of the school year.
"In such circumstances, they drink from bad notes or, on the contrary, they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"On the day of the witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunk children at the same time," adds Pelikán.
The drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and the nutrients that are missing from the body.
"They carry it much better, because after the agitated night, they get up well and they don't hurt at all."
"They are only confused about where they are," says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose the good mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
Ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for serious patients costs about tens of thousands of crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell children how much their drunkenness has cost and they would have to spend all summer in a youth job to earn enough to pay for themselves that night," Pelikán adds.
Medical insurance, in your opinion, perhaps as a retrogressive measure, which usually returns people the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in the hands of others in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, left on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time a device of this kind has been in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad for practice or demonstration flights.
This is the biplaza version L-159T1, which so far used the Czech army and which was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-seat aircraft.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the company Omnipol, has already taken over them last week.
Jan Peješk, from the defense press department, indicates that it is not yet known when Vodochody's planes will be physically withdrawn.
"The L-159 single-seater aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the repaired aircraft long ago, with no additional investments or contributions by the Ministry."
"The biplaza L-159T1 were exchanged in its present state," he told Právo Pejšek.
He added that the army did not run out of two-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new aircraft was received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS undertook to add aircraft to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the company that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and will serve for the pilot practices of NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how he will use them in this framework," says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by a Home plane and the purchase of three other aircraft by 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defence management states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by conducting a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at Kbely's bus airport in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the annular indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than annular are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
They could depend on the testosterone level, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said Co-author Ros Eeles, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart from over 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the indica finger of the right hand shorter than the annular.
They had the same odds of having prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the annular finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows the study, but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer can be "fully demonstrated".
The Czech Republic under snow: the D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, dawned on Thursday covered with snow.
The roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and the snow-clearing machines have been circulating all night in many areas.
In the morning the road D5 was closed between the kilometres 89 and 93 towards Rozvav due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourism, as was the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was broadcast by the operator of Ustředniho automotoklubu (UAMK).
A truck was broken down at kilometre 91, and two industrial vehicles were crashed in 93, causing injuries.
Several tourists also ended up in the cane.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometre 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks crashed there.
Drivers must slowly move after Brno in the kilometre 190 or cross Brno and be incorporated in the kilometre 182 in Kývalce.
There have been attacks of several kilometers.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a multi-centimeter layer of snow and the thermometers indicate -7 °C.
For example, attacks are taking place in Prosek, although Štěrboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
The trams circulate late, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, there will be another state of crisis in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport closed from 11 o'clock in the evening from Wednesday until 5 o'clock in the morning.
Currently, it can already be circulated on most roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brněnska snow tongues are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To dispose of them, milling machines will be required.
For the time being, it cannot be said when they will open up to circulation.
In Hodoninska, caution is required in the Bílé Karpaty area (White Carpathians).
The roads of the region which, since it is a protected natural zone, should simply be left inert state, accumulate up to five centimetres of snow, according to ČTK.
In Chechnya they fell between two and ten centimetres of snow, more in the north of Bohemia, where the layer of snow reaches 18 centimetres.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snows gradually return to Chechnya.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American army is using in Afghanistan a new "smart" weapon, known for the time being only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that "change the progress of the game" would make its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun with an extremely precise aim.
His bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm-caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive load it contains actually causes it to work as a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies who hide behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Undoubtedly, normal protection cannot be used and, when you launch your murderous rain of metal stilts, it can be essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to it its laser beam, which determines the distance, then gets a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and tightens the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pressed, the gun is loaded and the projectile is thrown at a distance of 543 meters, less one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 jobs are being moved
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch office to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu transfers its branch office to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As reported by the giant computer industry and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße Street in Niederrad district, Frankfurt.
One Fujitsu spokesperson explained that in the medium term another 100 more employees of the consortium, who were previously scattered across the region, will be accommodated there.
The offer is highly attractive, in addition to the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company in the region caused yesterday joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt Economics Section Chief Markus Frank (CDU) stated that this has earned a "Global Player".
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site".
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a great impulse for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger's mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu's decision.
The address informed the city earlier about its intention.
"We have naturally offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader Platz have not been able to change the difficulties.
After all, the economic reasons led to the fall.
In such a way, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope that the owner and the tenant of the building will show up cooperatively."
The property previously used by Fujitsu at Rathausplatz and the neighbor "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years now of a controversial project to build the seaside city.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the town hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive building that previously used the holes as parking spaces and the level of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment consultancy and valuation companies, the software manufacturer for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, and then Siemens joined the Fujitsu computer manufacturer house.
In 2006, Fujitsu's building was purchased by Frankfurt's real estate group, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Groupe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu, a consortium from Tokyo, is recognized as the world's third-largest IT provider.
It has companies, e.g. computers and servers, and also provides accurate services.
The branch office in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is located from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented in Astro Park's office building.
The ancient complex of the 1920s, its name refers to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
The anguish is taking over more and more Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has removed the disclosure platform from your server.
Possibly behind is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly arrested in England.
Wikileaks' platform for revelations is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to the Wikileaks boycott.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, must remain in detention in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from Amazon server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom", the activists of the revelations communicated through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon services web to be able to cope with the high numbers of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Perfect, we will spend our dollars hiring people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its server through Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had applied for investigations, CNN reported a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate Security Council of the country had threatened Amazon with boycott, said the British "Guardian".
"I had hoped that Amazon would take these measures before, before previous Wikileaks classified information publications," said the senator.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and disregarded process of Wikileaks puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world," said an independent senator's statement.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to extend stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The internet activist has consistently described research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson stated in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's safety, said Hrafnsson.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to North America's statements.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the leader of Wikileaks revelations must be tried for treason and must be executed.
In Canada, an advisor to the head of government Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange a great dispute grows.
Robert Gibbs, U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman, described Assange as "ridiculous and absurd" that he had requested the resignation of the Secretary of State, in case she was responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in spying.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website."
The American government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed exceptional manager, announced the White House.
So Travers is responsible for developing "important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks filtering.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads as well as to change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that to take care of the security of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
At the Gelato University in Bologna, refrigerators are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
Ice cream and ice cream.
The ice cream maker produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream production.
The ice cream removes with a spatula the cream of the ice cream from the counter, spreads it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk in mild ice cream their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of this California art, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product on the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something of her own in a few years in an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream from their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because his children love Italian ice cream.
The master heladero Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants later the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only its good taste, but also its silky softness and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget its formation nor the nata cover of the national superior house and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that is why each ball has something romantic."
The first step to the elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the tap of the machine and come out a pasteurized white basic cream, the base for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a stellizer?
How can you give free rein to some desire to experience?
Luciano advises that they lose sight of the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", at best has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, place it in a bag and the customer will bite a granite ice cream sound.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Flavors are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, Master Luciano distinguishes among the ingredients which are bought in the fruit section or in the sweets section of the supermarket.
Besides, there's dust and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to paste aromatized ingredients into their merchandise."
"But you must experience it sometime."
Whether with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the cream of ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and cocoa powder as a basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now course participants can use the refrigerators.
Luciano lets them develop four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, muca and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
They also carry out the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
What you know better doesn't necessarily depend on it having more toffee or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary for hazelnut ice cream to taste dried fruit, if it contains more hazelnut.
The working group produces the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and some less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the flavor of ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice cream production is a problem of artymetics: Peanut melocoton is used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra portion of sugar is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano takes out a tool with which it fixes the amount of sugar of the fruit types (measuring of the wine grower for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately the tables facilitate the account.
Processing ice cream requires only physical application, as before.
It not only helps the tool for automatic processing of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, in which the mixture of prepared ice cream is beaten simultaneously and cooled to zero temperature.
Despite everything, all automation is left out in terms of the small pasta.
Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if it were a giant mini-first without control.
"In all the courses," says Master Luciano, "it's just a matter of time for something like this to happen."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry that is experimenting with GM plants.
This issue is currently being formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for independent evaluation of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been engaged for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortia like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to Efsa's verification of genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, says Then.
Efsa's provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of Ephsa was without the support or the transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed its side with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, which carried out the General Environment Office as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, Ephsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, are used, provided they are of high quality and technical quality, and are ordered in a report.
Experts working in Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It is called itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without the charge of Lobby.
On this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticise that GM plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
"We want to know what, for example, makes genetically modified maize in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you going to find them?", ask, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
Scientists have been investigating the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and are currently working at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, in the US and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not generally published.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck says.
The Trace of Stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday I was at Stuttgart Station, with the Tube behind my back.
There were demonstrations
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the northern wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Miles and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing was rubbled.
Rotate in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They mustn't disappear."
He gets excited: "A cheap and poor, simple and natural stone."
As he once said, he's smelled the smoke from cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of Stuttgart's stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former ammunition warehouse in the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He's bought everything that results from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, grind the gravel or send it to the dumpster," says a wooden house in his office, which was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the northern wing from the company of debris.
He spoke to the 21S enemies for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the downfall.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80 kilos cut mazizo, with a price per piece from 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a memory but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest of it has been sold for a long time.
Owner of gardens, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from all over and took what they could take in the trunk and on top of it.
The Stuttgart stone of the impulse has long become the "wall" or the boundary of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is really nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
He ascends to his all-terrain, makes a tour of his great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, interested computers and finally works with stones.
And he's a stone lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He carries his treasures all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the country.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sandstones chopped.
"They belonged to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," he explains.
White, yellow, warm, excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Note a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Good travertine."
Formerly, the mazizos belonged to the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of the police chief of Stuttgart, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, toba of the hospital of Heilbronner.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he sculpted the stones before and moved them with a simple rig and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
It has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to the stone dealer, besides canteros, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the man who takes advantage of the remains.
Soon you have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Fighting talent around great potentials
Reina an active influx into the buffet.
16 students flock around the sandwiches, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students in mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a sort of ideas contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivalizing and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, gather in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: To hire the most talented students in universities as soon as possible before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications on the skills of their students, they try to support outstanding talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium won the talents.
A lady from the staff department distributes pens, gums and folders with the VW logo.
It explains to the young talents the programs of practice and the jobs for students and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig takes the project with VW.
See advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, look more closely at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are wanted so directly.
"The main point previously was in technical projects," says Selle.
The struggle for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not they have to be announced and, above all, to get a highly skilled workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Engineering Association (VDI) there were 40,000 vacant engineering posts in October.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this vacuum of engineers will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for talent hunting.
It organizes expensive recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincana, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the US the following year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG's subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the cream of many participants goes to the US.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to highlight the mass."
"The simple journey alone was short for us."
For the Dykta hunters the notes give results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all participants."
"Some are close to their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach to the campus, they are also hunting, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their labor fairs.
"We're trying to get students at the specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Satha Stübe, staff manager for Solarworld's solar technology manufacturer.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company's website.
"It is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that you can practice with us or carry out your thesis.
No expensive advertising campaigns are carried out for solar specialists.
That's why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: Personal environment, plain hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium cannot normally offer it," says Stübe, the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The key factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good opportunities for promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld has 55 of Germany's top 100 employers.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German employment providers.
For what you ask the employee how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in it and observes the employees' preconditions.
Stübe, the staff manager also expects extra points in her classification for her job seekers.
"I believe that the applicant is especially fixed in the external classifications of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies who want a long-term strategy to gain a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer goes through the employees themselves," he says.
In the jargon of the sector is called Employer Internal Branding, also promotion of corporate identity within the template itself.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thereby overturned its previous plans in an unappealable manner.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast remain new perforations sealed for the moment.
This was announced by the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will be in effect for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in April.
Before the misfortune that cost eleven workers their lives and caused the biggest environmental catastrophe in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new perforations in the western Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to reduce US dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced with millions of demands.
An Obama commission of inquiry will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the perforation moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, several peterole consortia submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
At present, the responsible supervisory authority, which after being charged with corruption charges has fallen into disdain, is radically reformed.
Obama announces in parallel that the lucrative fiscal loopholes for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total mining in the Gulf will be smaller thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey conducted by the BDO consulting company - before the Wednesday extraction ban.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are rapidly prolonged, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil marble, smells like a gas station: Millions of liters spilled of crude have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live in theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari looks good.
"Don't get tired," reassures the environmental activist to the journalists: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wandering in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulences on the surface: With the colorful glow of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is not apparent that brown oil stains float on the surface.
Before here I used to take leg-to-legs, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the flowing waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the wonderful wetland by a broken pipe.
Fish in the vicinity of the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach waters full of fish: That, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the worst regions in the world.
On the way to the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine removes a brown broth, which plunges its hand into the water, will pull out a bunch of oil.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground as dark sticks of royalty, sadly isolate the palm trees that shock and hang their palms.
In vain are sought flocks of birds, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier from the outside is silenced, a sort of ghostly calm of a previous paradise with smell of gasliner is expanded in it.
"What's happening here is an ecological struggle," he says, a hurricane, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
War comparison is proceeding.
The zone of the settlement of the Ogoni is a rugged battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers broke in more than 60 years ago, here was organized the first resistance in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today it is forbidden to return companies to Ogoniland: While they pumped more than two million barrels of black gold daily from the entire delta region, three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred metres, steel platforms stood out as straphalar water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drilling machines.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
At every moment a head fails, Akpobari thinks, then he drives a constant drop of oil into the water.
According to the experts' assessments, more than two billion litres have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the wreck of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaskan Sea, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the long-lasting environmental region will deal with this.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see heads about to break and pipes leaking as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the world to conventional ones, accused scientist Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: Only the fault rates of pipes are "on a multiple greater than elsewhere".
In a place, which from afar seems forgotten, there appears a workshop full of oil under the open sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire flames: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil heats up in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the container, later the oil pipe drips and finally comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300 liter diesel barrels daily: "It brings us 34,000 nairs," about $22.
Delta dwellers take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros per cent per litre, illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers," who rigged the pipeline network across Ogoniland: According to experts, at this stage at least 16 million litres of oil per day are lost throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and high military positions, keep the best part in aljibes and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers purely academic the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or to the loose way of production.
"If the oil tankers did not behave as invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the ogoni are destroyed above all by Shell to the point that only a deduction of the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like Chinese."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's about time you disappeared," says the muscular Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come in any minute."
If the special unit of the army takes the illegal refiners, it does not threaten them to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of raw materials.
"This doomed invention has completely torn our country apart," Akpobari says.
Researchers detect hazardous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that carried out a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus that carried out an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than it could be imagined: Australian air safety authorities perceived, thanks to their investigations, a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a cuff connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
Australia's airline launches legal media against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in the Sidney Federal Court that allowed for further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, Qantas Director, stated that his airline will claim compensation for the early November incident.
In the engine brand they have lost pieces and their wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from all over the world have to be replaced.
The Australian researchers announced that they will carry out more safety tests on superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, ATSB spokesperson.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas aircraft's emergency landing, the airline kept its fleet A380 on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of its eleven A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa rested the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double decked plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A Nevada all over the country causes chaos in traffic
Germany totally white: From one day to another it has snowed in almost the whole country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter Ice Germany: Almost all the country reached frosty temperatures on Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer of 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited in most highways and many streets.
In the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the skirmishes are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not prepared.
In addition, strong winds sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects living tides with the level of water 1.2 meters above its usual level on the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the Meteorological Service Weathermedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, in fact the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of freshly falling snow and cold and strong winds take care to pamper it.
There many trucks and cars were trapped overnight.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, the police authorities reported significant disturbances on the streets.
In A2, the snow and wind paralyzed the traffic and created jams.
In Turingia, snowfalls affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disorders are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Turingia and northern Bavaria.
The snow on the road, the trees falling on the lanes or the broken chain and the holes are the main problems.
The long-distance service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended in Saxony.
In Saafeld, Turingia an ICE train had to stop its trip to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service served the 165 passengers on the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
Winds with snow sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, snow winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokesman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman for Fraport there are already 40 cancelled flights.
The skirmishes are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 country beds prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a track crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to the snowy streets: Also here a truck was hit at a track crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the journey from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died, after giving a ride with her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will become softer and dustier and will therefore crumble in soft streaks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and rapid winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank seeks a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution seeks buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank arranged its headquarters: Twin towers were modernized in Frankfurt's bank district; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to take advantage of the costs of the meeting, and seeks a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" claims on the basis of a spokesperson.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the sale on the project.
"We always check whether it is appropriate to own or sell the properties and then rent them again," he said.
That is why Germany's largest credit institution is renouncing its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investor of a home fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached a figure of approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
The experts in this field calculate the value of the towers of the newspaper renamed "Greentowers" in about 500 million euros.
If the renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor, it has not been revealed at the moment, the spokesman said.
Thousands of mourners for deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who were killed after many explosions in a mine.
However, the bodies have not been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago, an intense explosion took place at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced to the place of misfortune, but it did not discover any sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment could be lowered for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts concluded that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Today, family members and friends remind the deceased of a commemorative event.
Ten thousand people have changed with the glowing sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
Keep quiet for two minutes.
In homage to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal objects under clothing and surfboards.
The flags waved at half an hour in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," said John Key, President of the New Zealand government, to the participants in the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began by extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the island of southern New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been removed, the burning temperatures inside the mine will begin to descend, said Gary Knowles, the police superior, to journalists.
To hell with it, warrior!
Does the gore fit into artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the borders of the genre with his epic battles "Walhalla Rising".
In what audience will the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A single-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and assassinates his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators who seek bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and tear his enemies' guts out of their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, does not say almost any word throughout the film and the other characters let themselves be carried by as much one or two sentences or a couple of painful mortal screams.
Otherwise they are silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the backstages offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for filmmakers who are grown up and interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several target groups it is a pity that they cannot be ruled out to each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and trilogy on the drug-trafficking comb "Pusher" as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses to make his works for all audiences with something more humor in the main stream or something less brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and budding guts cannot deter most of the followers of artistic cinema.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and an eternity is stuck in calm and fog before his team reaches America and again shuts up there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinematographic distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the presumptuous and bloody facade, a piece of cinema is hidden sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film does not deal with dialogues or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a febrile dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is awarded just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the lugubrous soundtrack of trance make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a young blonde, who faithfully supports Unojo, retains something as innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of one eye, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Land Movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country rejects its opinion on this issue until controls are allowed.
On the middle night of 5-6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I warplanes attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Euphrates; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), dealing with a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley coming out of the river.
According to information from the CIA's U.S. international intelligence service in late April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the proximity of the very appropriate al-Kibar for plutonium production, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves for purposes other than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed a computer animation where the reactor components were before destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also taught photographs showing the building from nearby or from the inside.
It was a short time ago that the reactor was in operation, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years later of the bombing, it is hardly more known than at that time, the riddles became greater over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but that he hardly saw any indication that there was "a nuclear weapons program in the country".
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA presentation "plausible".
They lack solid evidence, as well as IAEA.
When asked how sure it was to have a reactor ahead, a high-ranking UN diplomat answered in a stoning way in summer that the IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions."
The Syrians disbanded very quickly from the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and raided the ground conscientiously.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium tracks in al-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, from commercial vendors in the moments just after the attack, which must have a higher information value than the CIA submitted.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
IAEA rejected it as unlikely after particle analysis.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss this matter, just as with regard to satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are prohibited from a second inspection at the Kibar and entry into the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also has a strict silence.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not been successful since June 2008 and "has progressively become a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, a serious violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons, for which the IAEA monitors, is finally pending.
IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in enlightenment, which must be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
Inspectors have not made public known to the public until the time of what equipment they are dealing with, what functions they have, or whether they seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as interns, again derived from the proximity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and located a building complex near Masyaf with satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspect objects.
It is possibly at or immediately next to a military base, and for this reason Syria prohibits entry into the three locations of IAEA.
In Vienna, it is said that Syrians fear a record that the United States has requested from IAEA to spy on military plants.
The nuclear detectives were alerted to the teams thanks to warnings from the U.S. secret service.
Through satellite photographs, IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three locations and the cube to the shore of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a high office in Vienna stated that at least one of the teams may be "related to fuel production".
But there is "no sign of sensitive activities", uranium enrichment or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is activated with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should be subsequently separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
Nor is there any doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are found in the three places.
As the hundreds of cargos disappeared from the trucks on the ground, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The OIAE considers the al-Tibni salt mine unlikely, located within a few kilometres from the Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste area.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked her to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three suspected suspect locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be random, but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that IAEA has used a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secrecy, only deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
In the meantime, Damascus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador fraught with so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the incoming nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: This requires the majority of the IAEA governing council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat said: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in the times of war
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the address of her debut still without a name.
She herself wrote the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
There is not much more known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's associations have protested quickly, and at the last moment they moved a few shooting days planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the UN High Commissioner's ambassador for refugees.
He is not a diplomat, weeks ago the women offered him a meeting in Hungary that he rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie's position in this regard gives enough of the victims on the script.
His organization, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended removing Jolie as an ambassador, says the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, gave behind a strip and loosened a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go in spite of everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, is entering the Yugoslav conflict with great effort, wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains unclear.
In the network there is a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the beginning of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnian, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "victim rape falls in love with torturer".
It's certain that Jolie's film really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
They can now achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script remains on the network illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here.
This afternoon is finally good again for the Irish.
No sign of distress
Instead, the home team dominates over its customers from Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans shout for joy while retrenching loud music, hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey Club vibrates in the Southerland Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this junkie drinking game and the discreet computer actually don't make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old's trying to have fun with that, distracting himself from the fulminating question, what the future will be for him.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will hold a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"He's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from a shot he got the work of his dreams as event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, her brother Colin currently works as an IT advisor in London.
Young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
Irish 100,000 will leave the country in the near future, forecast economic experts and the ESRI Social Research Institute in Dublin.
Up to 2015 there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
Forecasts are confirmed, a migration wave similar to that suffered by the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress that brought great well-being to the Irish, the melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses above all the well-trained young Irish people, for whom so far everything is uphill.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and with it to an entire generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a bleak future as the government only engages in assembly and no longer offers future prospects for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategies to achieve new jobs," says the 20-year-old girl.
He notes that his colleagues go from unremunerated practices to the following.
His greatest concern, he explains, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the theme of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to lead your career," says the manager.
On their website, photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another boy snowboarding in Canada appear.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in jails, if not carrying freedom and fun.
For half a year, Sean O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to be done for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
Now they're raising a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he went to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime to be able to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, since long ago the first time he stepped on the threshold of his home.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs a little bit embarrassed and goes for cold rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with careful gardens in front of the houses, in the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent financed by a credit.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid to fail with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
Civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he hears often today.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is, by far, as dramatic as in times past here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps with it we feel for the first time as Irish."
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last big economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Let the future go and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He's been working for a couple of years in London, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend go well in New Zealand?
But in these days there is one thing that worries you supermany: the celebration of your 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid he'll be able to degenerate at a farewell party.
"Only not too many emotions," he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Departed, it sounds very distressing."
"Better we call it a party to march, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private companies, continues to grow.
Crime creates greater concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latin barometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it allows for monitoring of changes in attitude in the region.
In the results of this year's survey, held in September and early October, two related issues are highlighted.
The first is the relatively animated mood prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in various countries along the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a great decline in production last year.
However, only half of respondents from Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see figure 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably more than 25 per cent in 2001 (figure 3).
About 34 per cent stated that they trusted in their country's Congress and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Furthermore, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and has been further reduced this year to 32%.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see figure 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general feeling of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see figure 5).
Around 31 per cent say that either they or a close relative have been victims of crime in the past year, a figure that has been reduced since 38 per cent of last year and is the lowest percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in greater support for private companies and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private companies are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow your country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same (and 80% support private companies), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19 per cent of respondents (compared to 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent compared to 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered most influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela has such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Waste picks
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, there was a much worse way than foreigners were afraid of trying to help the country go back after its problems.
Votes were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, ballots cast in the sewers, destroyed electoral schools and acts of intimidation.
Election schools opened hours late.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, reported fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were "relatively good elections in many ways."
The observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said, with caution, that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they may be, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
Disengagement is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes for the elections have yet been lost.
The two main candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, an old lady, have withdrawn their initial request in which they requested the invalidation of the vote.
But problems may still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has little support, if any, has moved on to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic is destroying the country, and more than a million earthquake survivors still live in tents, great abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
Around 250,000 identity papers, necessary for voting, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors believe that the election of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it is clear, the Haitians themselves think so too.
Moving from dots to center
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, up to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
However, it may turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to take over economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened following Kirchner's death due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have faced Mrs. Fernández.
However, after some chaotic sessions in which one Member punched another in the face and other Members accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply next year, which will provide the President with an even greater margin of action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate currently stands at 11.1 per cent, but many private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of trade unions, place it at about 30 per cent.
Mr Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed the private sector and made the INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now moderate these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its staff members claim that they want to limit salary increases in the next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports worldwide.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bond holders who had refused a forced restructuring prior to the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes approximately $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new price index for national consumption, which seems to be the prelude to the cleaning of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to remain in politics when she finishes her term, bearing in mind that she no longer has her husband at her side.
If you do, you will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has become tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you'll have to decide whether or not you repudiate, quietly, many of your husband's policies.
Mid-Hurrah for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
How does Taiwan feel about his big brother across the narrow?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, came on 27 November to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a defender of feelings on the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but for a little while.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayor elections, he failed to get the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (PDP), which has leaned on Taiwan's total independence, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidents, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of votes has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied up with the KMT in town halls.
The elections saw the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large agglomerations with banners and light girls dancing.
Nor did the mysterious attempt to murder rigour fail.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or to avenge the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to bow down to the KMT.
Perhaps the only great winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not addressed.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Therefore, the KMT often avoids giving publicity to its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging feelings against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma stated that it had been confirmed that his policy with regard to China was acceptable to most Taiwanese.
It is expected that the Government of Beijing will continue to bribe them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the fold.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
The best thing will be to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to pass for it.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned for corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, he openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PDP is working to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been welcomed as a PDP candidate for the presidency, as has Her Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to prove that he can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a point of contact between the PDP and China, provided that negotiations can be carried out without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to introduce himself to the presidents.
Even without Mr Chen interceding, the PDP will have difficulty in choosing from its potential candidates.
The KMT must also conduct a conscientious examination.
Mr. Ma's assessments have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity appears to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesperson says he will restructure his cabinet, as well as local teams.
The large samples from the PPD suggest that Taiwan's support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already crossed."
Grammy nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Artist revelation.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bass player and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammys' surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Considering that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Experanza", the nomination gives what to think, but it respects the Grammy rules that he must be an artist who has not taken more than three albums to the market before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly made great progress and, taking into account his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, can at least establish a distinction between Spalding and the path towards the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, who have recently concentrated in the jazz field for this category.
In the other categories, Grammy voters rightly honored "Historicity" by Vijay Iyer Trio, an exciting and magnificent album that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite New Orleans star and regular guest in "Treme", of the HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest leans considerably towards fusion as in the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild punk of Darcy James Argu's Secret Society won a well-deserved recognition in the category of big groups, competing against the great chamber jazz of Billy Children Ensemble and the ever-risk Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bass player's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in best classic album direction
Nominations in classical music for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina", by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among the nominees with links to southern California are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories that include orchestra, opera, choir and solo albums.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphony No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium - the Art of the Castrati" of several artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg by "Lulu" of the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concerto" of Dorman is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically to play it in Mandolin Avi Avital, which played the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old director Pierre Boulez was nominated in the category of orchestra function, for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The mosque proposed in Temecula obtains the approval of the commission of order
The Mezquita project for Temecula has obtained unanimous support from the local law commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying it fosters terrorism and jams.
However, the members of the commission decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha'i, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only they speak very loudly."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people who interceded in favor or against the center, almost the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"United States no longer exists," is read in one of the comments.
"It's another apes planet with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The plans for the construction of Islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the attacks took place on 11 September 2011.
In the Temecula Valley, the imam Mahmoud Harmoush has reported acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living smoothly in Riverside County for years, but it wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse that rented in a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4,32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe poses the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that arsenic can use as one of its nutrients broadens the possibility of finding new life forms on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it a very peculiar thing, although little is needed to be a really 'alien' type of way of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the online edition of Thursday's Science publication.
For a long time, there have been six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbes discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated great speculation on the Internet about the possibility of the report indicating the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "yes shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, at Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from the chemical point of view, so it speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, it may be difficult for different organisms to differentiate them."
"However, arsenic is different enough for it not to work as well as phosphorus, so it enters and, to say the least, calls the biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, to which they were able to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic in its place raises the possibility that it may naturally exist a way of life that uses arsenic, whether in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example had never been found that proved to work.
Arsenic was more common in the early eras of Earth, he pointed out, so researchers speculated that the early forms of life may have used it.
"Yes, it suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth formerly," Foster said, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institutes.
The missing stolen dogs have been found in Compton
The two missing dogs were found in front of the Bellflower motel, according to the sheriff's officers in Los Angeles County on Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which they were spending the night, in front of Bellflower Motel 6, according to the authorities.
Two of the canines recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met on Wednesday evening, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson for the sheriff's department in Los Angeles County.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They've returned with their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch) had not suffered damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the competitions of the area this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the national AKC/Eukanuba championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were to exhibit them in other competitions scheduled for the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, according to Peek to The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the almost two-month tour that the couple is taking part in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of your room window.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer breed, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they had a very thick coat and they'd be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so that dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen at six o'clock in the morning on Tuesday.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was not clear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM gets final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally got green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the "pre-armed" plan by creditors to erase approximately $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and premiere of films and television programs.
Thursday's ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to be revived under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide advice on the management needed to order its finances, while struggling to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and an expert in bankruptcy recovery, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial tribulations and satisfy the more than 140 creditors in the study took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009, the parties agreed to place the company for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion sought by creditors.
Before spring this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of discussion and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially exits bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multimillion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been collecting $375.000 a month for their company's administration services, will receive a $4 million success fee.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and gathered an annual board of seven or eight films that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The study needs to conclude a separate loan of between $265 and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to maintain the balance of his gift budget
While iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant pile in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five $99 BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or approximately 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently I visited three vendors of national toys, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law has been working; this year's technological toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less than last year's.
In addition, while there are usually fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best known such ones, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys powered by button batteries are increasing, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are teddy toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when they tighten their belly.
A squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze starts to set up a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start pressing, you can't stop.
For dance combined singing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking advantage of last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn shift games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative feet articulated with wheels with locking device.
The kids who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you're a kid from the '80s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a ride into a session with a notebook of self-correction exercises.
If you are suspicious of giving your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech MobiGo (60 dollars, 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although the games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, 3 to 12 years old), it is the first major development of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL (90 dollars, 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks just bigger than a box of matches, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to build words by putting the blocks in line before the time runs out; it's great for an improvised word-arming competition.
It's more and more toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on its presence in toy shops, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, 6-12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you change the code online, your child gets enough credits at the Penguin Club store for two items.
These could include skates on wheels or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly bigger than the pig of his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last in a line of microbots powered by button batteries.
The false insect moves quickly over 12 vibrating silicone legs in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of law enforcement in China is promoted
As an urban sergeant instructor, Tang Shenbin marked the step in a square in the city, severely inspecting the nervous people in charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the bountiful police of China's urban order, feared and despised by their capricious energetic measures and their inclination to violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Sign up!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "How are the pretty girls!"
Four girls who barely passed adolescence with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly lined black shoes.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly on top of the hair tied with blue and white stripes.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, unwisely.
"The models are cute."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
Guangdong Province changed the greyish green color from uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a snack cart, and observed it with the frown constantly frowning for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, specifically elected by their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the cops a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's low respect for these city squads.
And for a good reason, the critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are allowed only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, the Hubei Province inspectors shot a passerby after using their cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, describing itself as effectively beating criminals without making them bleed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon street salesman suffered brain damage after a five-officer riña.
A video game full of violence, available to download online, presents inspectors trained by Chinese who attack street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar in the government," said China Daily, a national publication, last year after another tactical controversy.
The newspaper demanded "a truly meticulous cleansing."
Sceptics say that the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested eight new female recruits by notice in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered whether women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's notice called for female candidates from 18 to 22 years old, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They should have had a height above average, over 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said that work was physically too difficult for women over 25 years of age.
"His image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities".
The female Chengguan are like florets, he said, and added, "In addition to being florets, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to support this description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job announcements for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not show up.
"We can't let a person catch or a hump come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his colored cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old workmate, Xu Yang, said "Our work must present the image of the city."
They do not object to their work on time either, they said, because they harbor greater career ambitions than simply to drive away vendors in the alleys where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Each morning, the squadron faces more or less a dozen street vendors who throw themselves on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many tofu rolls or bowls as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Ms. Xu as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his bike-drawn car with garrisons of noodles.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is more or less the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his free hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the merchandise of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan provincial capital, mumbled after the false rumor spread that some Chengguan officers had killed a salesman.
More than a dozen Chengguan police or officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were turned or set on fire.
For the time being, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Only two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike yelled rudely.
The situation was stagnated for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened their tails to their vehicles and left quickly with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men 40 years of age or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li with total naturality.
"Most of the time it is the public who begins the fight."
Prosecutors will not press charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday that the prosecutors of the Department of Justice have forgiven Senator John Ensign for the criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work through lobbying for the wife's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal about his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said he felt "certainly happy" for the decision, which came after an investigation of a whole year.
The senator could still face a disciplinary action by the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said that the Department of Justice had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plan to press charges against him on this issue."
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have confabulated to violate a federal criminal lobby ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to gain gain gainful work through lobbying, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton's work and counseled on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
Since Hampton had recently been an Ensign assistant, he was excluded under the law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethical experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the door-revolving status," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year's decision to abandon prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the midst of charges of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's main lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice on Monday and another phone call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to press charges against his client.
Ensign's defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in trying to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable getting into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a complaint separated by the ethics group, claiming that a payment of $96,000 from Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got work through lobbying thanks to Ensign's help to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was "masking" the Ministry of the Interior on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to apply for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the Department of Justice's example and complete its investigation.
"Senator Ensign has a desire to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chateing" in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minutes a minute, they sent reports of the appalling testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the trial largely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to arrive at an official final, with the imposition of the death penalty judge voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have filed papers in the court that outline the arguments of the appeals that are likely to occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative states that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "an atmosphere of circus", and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details caused public passions to exert inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force appellate judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"According to what I experienced during this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Senior Defence Counsel for Mr. Hayes.
First-instance judge Jon C. Blue of the High State Court lavishly rejected the lawsuits in a judgment last week, saying that the news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was led by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the courts of appeal have recognized that the coverage of famous cases can generate questions about the impartiality of a trial.
In a historic judgment of 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the conviction of an osteopata from Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television program and the film "The fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later could be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general concern about the impact of the new media" in high profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford School of Laws, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from court chambers could make trials fairer.
The issue of Twitter is just one of many of the topics outlined by Hayes' lawyers, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defence lawyers also state, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11.
Defence lawyers say that they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized the prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
The jurors weren't kidnapped.
But their arguments on the effect of intense process coverage can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a refusal to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media were continually throwing firewood at the emotion of the case.
"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps in the whole state."
Your attention to Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports delivered more slowly, was a ludicrous vision that would make the court's policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the courts of appeal were often attracted to the arguments on the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the 1966 decision of the Supreme Court, which revoked Dr. Sheppard's conviction due to the coverage of the trial, and made it clear that they would require new media to require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can civilism build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invectiveness and negativity, this week has triggered a bit of civicism in Washington.
Is it a sign of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to party combat in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not yield any progress on the major issues to be dealt with during the outgoing session.
But from what they all say, it was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to win partisan points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the President's deficit committee was equally civilised, despite the political differences that still exist between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a trial period, testing each other to identify signs of co-operativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
The reason why the meeting on Tuesday and subsequent evaluations of the meeting by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and are deeply rooted to suggest any rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way things are said," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They're inevitable after the election.
The elections awaken partisan passions, which then become extinct.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, the Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are won at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans cannot make believe that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, together with the ratification of the new START nuclear disarmament pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanism when the new 112nd Congress meets in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very probable and even inevitable that a period of disagreement should begin.
"After the things to be done are carried out, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to one of confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civicism can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as an essay for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they must try to fulfill their promises to cut state spending and nullify the new health law.
These lines of support are already clearly observed in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, including the reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and the retirement age, and the cut in expenditure.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken care of one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forcibly introduced the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the officials elected to the panel, suggesting that there is, at least at present, little basis or desire for commitment in tax matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan shocks, when Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanism of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks he's losing will probably change course and seek compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
Partyism and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in Congress than between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties view 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilism shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked American document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "chleptocracy", and leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money that directly collects the Kremlin, according to the U.S. Embassy in Russia in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service handle huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority," takes its share as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have systematically denied the accusations of corruption over the years, and he has won several lawsuits for libel on such accusations.
In September, when on a Russian television channel he was asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt, he said, "It's crazy, it's a patsy, it's a mess."
According to the polls, the Russians believe overwhelmingly that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy's report, and it is unheard of that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do so.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government with crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to affirm that the government functions more as a cleptocracy than as a government," the note says.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and mafia that literally means "text" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"The analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
"SFS, MVD and militia are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects money from larger companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to protect MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while money collection is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not quickly pay find their businesses closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has achieved little progress.
The embassy note reports about men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of India's Moscow expert group, in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, India estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption conducted by the NGO Transparency International, the country was ranked 154 (countries are ranked at least as corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not happen until late in Moscow's evening, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and he reacted furiously by a revelation claiming that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would be done in such an immoral way."
The veterans of the Red Jemers forced to face the past
In a concrete classroom weakly lit, with stained and peeled walls, the director of the Anlong Veng Secondary School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Red Jemers.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the Carnicero" for his brutality during the government of the Red Jemeres, the commander remains popular in this remote former fortress of the Red Jemeres in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemers surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Red Jemeres to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations and Cambodia mixed court issued the first sentence of a former member of the Red Jemeres, sentencing the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Red Jemeres of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among former Red Jemeres, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Jemers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the government of the Cambodian Red Jemeres, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowed the government led by Pol Pot, the remains of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
Like Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of fighters from the Red Jemers began to defect to the government, culminating in Ieng Sary's 1996 returns and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan's 1998 returns.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of its benefactors, the oldest fighters of the Red Jemeres fell into absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few Red Jemer elite officials retained their local administrative positions in exchange for laying down their weapons, the shallow soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have gained few benefits after surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any concept to do business."
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemeres when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemers was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to self-supply."
The current Court of the Red Jemers has also caused concerns here.
Early next year, the court is expected to start prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Jemeres.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the main leaders and those with greater responsibility for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This did not help much to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the government of the Red Jemeres in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced labourers were thought to have died.
During a recent noisy afternoon, Im Chaem returned to work in the fields at his home on wooden pilots on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the dry pasture, Im Chaem refused to speak of his past in the Red Jemeres.
She stated that if the court summoned her, she would not appear.
"Camboya is at peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted the Red Jemers in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Camboya must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, Chhang Youk said, from the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to rejoin the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first textbook approved by the government on the Red Jemeres, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the secondary school history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemeres.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details about the Red Jemeres, despite the city's connection to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure how many people will sue the court."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to produce an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Jemers retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black soot covered by an oxidized roof of leaf.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the edge of the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last break, where he would leave a handful of mature bananas hoping to have good luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its reserve of uranium qualified for armaments
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will renounce its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement issued after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the margins of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to renounce its highly enriched uranium and it seemed that they had reached a point without return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of operations were conducted classified with Belarus in the last two months, to remove 84.82 kg of qualified uranium for weaponry from a Belarusian investigation facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to one official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I really felt fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Society, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have conserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically uranium qualified for armaments) and low enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials stated that the first task of withdrawing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to the officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was made by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with low-enrichment uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working on Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for armaments, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will seek to eliminate its reservation towards 2012, according to the joint declaration.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested potential distension.
It was stated that "while progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central theme for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens".
The Spanish Government did not repair CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not repair CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda directed to Guantanamo by Spanish territory, according to the US ambassador in Madrid on a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice-president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate vigilance over foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting was held between former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights across Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "unexpected," says Aguirre on a cable.
Also the then Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, by being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity to influence".
For his part, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors", rather than the declassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manage the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 at a luncheon between the US ambassador and the Interior Minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they think is right," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US government," he says.

With this nickname, which he has used since childhood, he communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the Corunj village of which she is from.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know his sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies of his family members.
The 30-year-old Welsh girl started a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Tuñez, an industrialist.
It lasted a year.
When he was left, she was soon known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
He didn't take long to meet another bridegroom.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, neighboring municipality.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even went to Palma for a week.
But because of the content of the communications, it appears that his romance was fractured, that they broke.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and musked, because I came to work."
"When I told him he felt good, but of course, now he realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not be free to do what he wants."
Then he talks about a message to the mobile phone that he just received: "I want you to turn this month or give me an address to send the child."
She complains: "If she doesn't like me leaving the kid with my mother, I'll pick him up when he comes back," she claims.
In May, he talks about the return to his people: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only be there until the 19th, because the 20th I have to present myself to a job in order not to lose it."
He makes it clear that if everything goes well, he takes his firstborn.
"He will be with whom he should, that is, with me, and never in life will I ever think of leaving him again with anyone other than my mother", dubious intention given his bad relations.
In July, there's another post.
When he typed it, the child, who arrived on the island on 1st of that month, was supposed to be killed on 10th, is dead.
"César is happy on the one hand, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other he's going to class almost every day."
He's talking about a transfer to Majorca.
"He will go there (the child) to some summer classes, and so save me some kangaroo pasta."
17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to email, see how when he wants to find me, he has to fuck himself."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's making money for me."
On the internet there are messages from you on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where he was called "Muki the jailer."
"Terror to the Galician"
The last man who lived with her, a sworn guard, declares his grief for feeling guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial prison in Palma yesterday, coming from the detention centre in Menorca.
Lawyer Carlos Maceda explained that he does not remember how the facts happened, "not having intended to cause any harm to the minor."
Before, he confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested psychiatric evidence.
The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has the general view because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in these elections often doubles to the one it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomics, the figure rose to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has been fuelled by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 Members in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 Members (now 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - now it has three - while ICV would stay with one MP or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar continues, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its prominence at the head of the Barcelona Diputation, one of the administrations that most budget handles - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and populars agree on the possibility that the PSC loses the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not obtain a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be unbalanced that this formation loses its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can take the turn in the Tarragonese capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been located only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
Popular people have also grown up in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by officers of the General Police Information Commissioner in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the latter author of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "Kampai operation" has been "debilitated" Al Qaeda's falsification apparatus at the international level and, therefore, its operational capacity".
The researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that their "combatants" can cross European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The distancing cell is not the only one that the jihadist network operated in Europe, hence that in the investigations have participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the territory of the EU are carried out in the next days similar blows to the one developed last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was developed in Thailand with the capture of the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikallaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who led the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole tourists passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents should be in the name of men aged 25 to 45, valid for several years and without printed visas.
In the media of the investigation it is emphasized that, at the moment, no data has been found linking the arrested in Catalonia with the Bombay bombing, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia they were sent through a transfer agency some thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended the life of 106 people.
The police have seized abundant documentation.
PP demands Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already proposed during the campaign and which is summed up in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and to dispense with phylo-soveranist adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to pose in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan populars went to the meeting of Artur Mas with the certainty that he had obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to make himself wanted, because the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise to abstain in the vote of investiture.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but, for the time being, the talks that Mas has with the rest of the political leaders are being held in Catalan.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an investiture "all sovereignist and independentist speeches will have to be parked", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to referendum.
Both leaders have in common their bet on slimming down the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiations on Mas's investiture will be handled by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a harsh opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do so with Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric states that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot don't rule out that their cager killed more than 11 elders.
The managers of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there was employed killed at least eleven elderly people he was in charge of.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to charge the person responsible for the deaths" but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And it is that, in addition to the social contempt that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the graver, the great threat to La Caritat is now in the form of substantial compensation that is already being calculated by the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then she has not stopped killing.
The judge has already pointed out in the car ordering the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric - who suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but that, according to the age and the pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied yesterday this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures cannot at any time have been the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in the case there is not a single indication that there has been reckless action by any other person other than the accused himself."
He already baptized as "Angel de la Muerte" confessed before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that the first crime committed it on August 29, 2009 for, a month and a half later, killing a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by pinching an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by helping him with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the centre have access to medicines.
Insulin punctures and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his effort to alleviate the suffering of inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify whether Vila does not lie and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, she abraded them inside by giving them distance as she has already confessed that she did with the three women she killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the graver, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that he is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say that they are made available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday that warned "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Peripheral differentials have closed strongly and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make a mistake either, and the euro has barely picked up what is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illegal market that just as it collapses is recovered but motivated by the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and we will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded the completion of the public debt purchase plan for ineffectiveness and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the term and leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope that they will extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that you will continue your bonus purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, may God assist us!
As at their May meeting in which they stated that they had neither contemplated the purchase of bonds nor collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazuca on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of letters to one year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million at 5.28%, compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potentials and have until February to obtain private capital or will become nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress tests, the figures are assumable within the Aid Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and still has insufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax tension in the face of the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which a political commitment is needed that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four stations of Vivaldi.
The dual Trichet and ZP effect explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and blunt and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bonus that will be benefited by the Trichet effect so we hope it will be resolved with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Help Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury have more than 40 billion in available liquidity the triple that in March, to very expensive types and closes access to markets without saying.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being, to look like it".
Take it easy, we can.
Eulen's president will challenge Vega Sicilia's board requested by his children
The temporary does not amanize in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, by considering it "full-fledged nullity", the judicial board of El Enebro on the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take place with the management bodies of the titular firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary Joseph are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their dispute over control by the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding company does not seem willing to give in to his dispute to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
On his board of directors he was disembarked by five of his seven sons who were appointed directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year and whose challenge is noted in the Commercial Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantil Number 2 of Madrid, has reopened the box of thunder within the Alvarez family.
The judge's recourse to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is qualified by David Álvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants their five children to, through procedural argument, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of law, try to validate and heal the radically null junta of 18 January", according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for a challenge to the board once it has been held, considering it to be "full-fledged".
The same protagonists, who remain silent, have already attempted unsuccessfully to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's seven children control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group claims, however, the usufruct of 51 per cent of the capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is the substantive issue to be decided by the judge once the hearing on the appeal is held, for which there is not yet a date indicated.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software designs real-time car improvements.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his story in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into consideration the choices of a newly arrived squadron and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship they all bet on the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without demeriting the ability as a pilot of the final champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor of the ability of the Renault engine to propel his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational has placed in Red Bull's hands to turn it into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far away from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design factory assembly chains worldwide, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable failures and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Siemens Industrial Division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out "in a few hours, almost real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that the squid stores in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 young high-quality professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all sorts of changes in the bolids.
Siemens's manager explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's bolids with the exception of the engine, which is Renault's entire responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological improvement is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech factory to design and produce its bolides in a locality about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret".
The staffing table for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two pilots, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1 is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, are hidden other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety null.
Factory technology chief Steve Nevey says five years ago it could be said that R & D advances in wagon cars contributed 50% of the victories and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology adds 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15% of added value.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive collaborative store in Barcelona yesterday is its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will match this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, set as an example the remodeled store located in the Gran Vía Barcelonesa, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom he has been collaborating for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, including the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being Barcelona's third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems also assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with industry experience and knowledge.
The American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of shops (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that this was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve customer and SME service in purchasing, care, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-wide pioneering pilot program that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP hardware in warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies already have technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'robar' a million customers to their rivals in three years
More optimistic than other managers, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially discards a new liquidity crisis and vaticine the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it provides for a collapse of interest margins, which will attempt to compensate in part for increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private customers, his outstanding subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new management plan that will have a three-year maturity.
The aim, besides surviving without the need to resort to the public aid of FROB, is to earn market share with the capture of a million new private customers -700,000 if you discount those who can leave the bank -, their great subject pending, since so far had more spoiled the SMEs and companies than the retail customer.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with reduction of costs as objective, and whose challenges the bank will expose them when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare to set targets and make them public at this time, as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the world bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year his Optima master plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation made it an additional exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the liability war - which penalizes the margins - is shrinking, the price of the risk premiums that are paying banks and cash for their emissions to obtain liquidity are already being transferred to the credit price to compensate for the fall of the margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it's going to be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued orders to his network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials -see FiveDays of 22 and 27 November-.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend now "is to go up commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain "greater sizes will be required."
"Next year is going to move everything," he said.
He claims that capital needs are "very high" and does not rule out that any Spanish financial institution comes into red numbers.
And it points out that FROB can supple the market in raising funds to new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remained important to what some bankers already vaticinate as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which dampens the crisis.
ECSC discards a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that a wave of mergers of savings banks would take place and reiterated the speed at which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When he started the process of concentrating the Spanish savings banks, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations would occur.
"I think the largest part of the mergers have been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Banking group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; instead of 17 let's go to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been done and protected by the Banco de España, which has collaborated a lot too," said the manager.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has explained that the process of concentration is taking place "at the highest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is taking place within the deadlines that in their day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Banco de España", he emphasized.
"To move from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion assets to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Banco de España does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The manager pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has embarked on a process of concentration "very important" and that "gos as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank was very well stopped from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private agencies of placement or suppression of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without benefit, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and of 30% of Lotteries of the State.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How do you interpret these movements?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which is in shock with maintaining the old traditions of much of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although it now seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the violating countries, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there is no excuse.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German Government took a constitutional reform out of the way to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans of fiscal rigour and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended Greece's rescue decision.
It was already the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and public opinion and published opinion were very much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel emerges again with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union's treaties, in order to make possible the rescue of a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been adopted and, in the coming months, we should assist in the process of reforming the Union that will enable those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if we now have to take action with which he may not very much agree, from that date on the old functioning of the euro, it will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries will be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run at part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, productivity improvements and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand.
It is not just about extending the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will make way for greater tranquility.
And let's take advantage of the window of opportunity they gave us, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms to Merkel, the thesis that order must be put at home has opened its way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it doesn't look like they're going to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, that of leaving a monetary zone too crowded from unserious countries, cannot be excluded.
Then, Germany will always be able to tell us that he had already warned us.
Sport and law fraud
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in front of Ajax prove ingenious but not willing to escape a sanction.
The alleged expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match held on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink rivers to be written about whether such behavior is anti-sportive and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time in taking away faults to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as leader of its group, both players will carry out the regulatory sanction the next game of the Liguilla, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass cards clean to the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two parties, and with different economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the case reported is that it has been starred by a team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his anthem presumes of nobility and honor, and who in past times has fined his players for similar acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his dilated history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether such behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e., whether such actions are fraud of law; for they are indeed actions that are respectful of the sports regulation, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question goes on to examine the type of damage to the sporting spirit.
One of the goods that understands the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not put in jeopardy, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these assets that is referred to with the clean game is to prevent the equipment of the offending players from taking unfair advantage of the opposite equipment, which also did not happen.
However, the paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it did not conform to what we normally characterized as a trap or a law fraud, because its violation of the rules was not made hidden to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely its action tried to be the most obvious so as to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is what kind of advantage offenders gain from the intentional misdemeanours examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that the rival is not placed at a disadvantage or profit in the same game, because obviously the result of the action means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club won't be able to count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will begin the next phase of the League of Champions without cards that may threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminateness, as the team can be eliminated from the first of the changes, and in addition with this performance the players play a penalty game and pass to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards is produced with a less than in the first cycle.
So, if you're going through rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions do not run counter to the sport spirit, of which it is a part to make strategic decisions that favor to make the most of what the rules allow.
In the event that we are concerned, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without drawing the punishment or running away from it.
Although the border between ingenuity and lawlessness is diffuse, on this occasion I believe it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, arises from two factors: because it was a matter of two self-expulsions and the way in which the transmission of the directive to provoke them was carried out.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners from groups in NCB
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
They proliferate self-sustained celebrations by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tourron and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners prior to Christmas, which continue to exercise as an oxygen ball for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector interviewed.
To finish complicated accounting, this year's calendar (when the New Year falls on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (on 16 and 17) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has already happened since 2008, when the phase of weak cows began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners on a budgetary basis.
In order not to neglect tradition, many workers keep it paying from their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, one and the other demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restaurací de Barcelona, Gaiète Farràs.
The employer's representative, to this day, does not dare to hesitate as the festivities of this month will be.
"People think about it a lot before booking."
"He wants to go out but he has the alerts on on the price issue," he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to lower a step with the crisis, so that the strip around 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a survey in various central establishments there is a collapse of requests by the night of 17.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a genuine boom of applications for that Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to what they have responded by adapting their menus to the juncture, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since early November.
"We have done what is impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros", they detail.
In AN Grup, which leaves El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to 23 locals, they remain optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second semester and some good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that the 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who precede the parties.
To its six group menus have added one Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green outbreaks in some companies that re-invite their employees and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat larger.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), his vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts to start seeing the end of the tunnel and claims that together the reservations are "animated", although the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That's right, the illusion of the holidays hasn't come down, pay whoever pays, it says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is causing great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a rate faster than any other country".
Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, rather than increasing, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a rate faster than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for the development in Washington.
The Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists this in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Advisor, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is contemplated, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as proliferating and reason to keep guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry at a meeting with his US counterparts.
The most innovative of the documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani rate of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", says: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of assistance are either unanswered or discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the leader that "the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups".
Hunting for Wikileaks' boss
Obama appoints a senior leader of the anti-terrorist struggle to avoid further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alarm" to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, it's not new, it's dated November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the last leaking of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents, but the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks creator's lawyer Mark Stephens says that "the police know where and how to get in touch with Mr. Assange."
It was the 20th when the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange "with a view to its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the so-called network notice free way to proceed to an arrest - which must be committed by the national police force - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the founder of the 39-year-old Wikileaks has been willing to respond by videoconference to questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the mythical Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution," says the missionary.
While the world seeks him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange remains unknown, but not silent.
On Monday he gave an indeterminate interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If you can show that you were responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the U.S. has signed, you should resign," he said.
His opinion was reputed yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the resignation request as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist leader, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's attempt to diminish Assange's importance contrasts with opinions that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and to prosecute anyone who gives them any contribution or assistance".
Further, Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to retreat after saying that Assange should "be killed."
"Obama should turn it into an objective and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"Anyone in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," Fox said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with guineas to the likes of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to draw the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without north for the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his resignation amago is insufficient for the likes of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can in no way cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the leader of Esquerra will try to win the new critics with guineas that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to pronounce on their continuity in secret.
By means of ballots, and not by hand lifted.
If the caroists want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the row leader wants to avoid the image of division as much as the image of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half another vote, but added, without precise percentages, that it would not be good a result "to the Bulgarian".
The next to Carod demand that the president do more than make his position available to the militia, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the highest organ between congresses.
But by not having the majority enough to force resignation, they will try to agree with the executive on a road map by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will put to the vote of the National Council on 18th.
Its intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for the latter promising to advance the congress in autumn 2011, something that the dome already gives for fact.
The leader of ERC acknowledged that "polyphony" harms stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, be able to wash dirty rags from doors inside.
In this line, it is symptomatic the article that the running adviser Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovation gave the fact that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, that is to say, include new faces coming from the sector towards Carod.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate assembly as a mechanism of operation at once.
He therefore called for a reform of the statutes to allow congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
To end the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which already fought in this regard at the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsion left the direction to review the assembly at a specific congress of reform of statutes.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend dealing with the matter.
Now, without sectors critical of stalking, it may be a good time to take it back and try to close it forever.

According to the MILENIO County State of Mexico, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the content of MILENIO State of Mexico.

Maintains China's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Goals
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supported its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by between 40 and 45 per cent.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, that country's representative at COP16.
At its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it made clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He said that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the adoption last year of a new Energy Act, which sets out the objectives set in terms of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, it stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and local authorities to achieve the objectives of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, it abounded, are in progress or have already concluded several multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments from other countries.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which had been implemented over the past five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, another for the change of incandescent outbreaks by savers and one more mitigation and adaptation project, he explained.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, the per capita greenhouse gas emission in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent over the past five years and is planning to do another one by 2020, it has abounded.
Attached to the Legality Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the NAP explained that the former Panist leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was committed to legality and that the former Panista leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sound Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right, if any, to come to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within the framework of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that National Action will be strengthened by the internal election of 4 and 5 December, in which its successor will be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal," he said.
The Panista leader specified that the PAN supports it 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; the counter "we enjoy it and strengthen it," he said.
He said that the council will certainly be able to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, hence he will deliver the scam "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquillity and openness, to any of the five I would be proud to give you the party president's office."
He predicted that the repunte that registered the party in the past elections on July 4 will be reflected in the upcoming contests, although "it is not time to think about 2012."
"For now it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he emphasized that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a source of observation throughout the country, hence that "many hopes, longings are placed on them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to expectations".
When questioned about the PRI's criticisms of President Felipe Calderón for his speech within the framework of the four years of his government, César Nava called on the PRI to reflect on the six-year-olds of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon; that they start defending them; that they leave the closet," he said.
He felt that the holder of the Federal Executive could make expressions such as those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there was no biting or much less censorship in the country.
Promote Obama on Twitter law for undocumented students
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation," tweeted the US president on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation," Obama tweeted.
His brief message kept an open cyber link with a broader document that asked the public to communicate immediately with the senators, since the vote on the legislation was imminent.
"With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation, unless the extension of the Bush era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement sometime at that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would request a "vote of closure of debate" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or American Dream Law would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the last five years and have entered a higher education institution or the army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require a handful of Republicans to compete, at a time when the project's supporters are heavily lobbyed to ensure the passage of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
That is why the Dream Act advocates need to add several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have declared that they will not back it another time.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature put the finger in the wound
The second round of The pleasures of the tongue was a walk where the participants showed the story
"That of Sex in the Language I understand but... the finger in the sore? what is expected of me?", asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another fair the round table dedicated to Sex in the Language, explained).
The finger in the latch... "puts us in tights", the Argentine writer gently spat to the public, mostly of young people, who met at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate round table by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of the knowledge which is the "llaga", goes from doctor to doctor, from which he does not get answers although clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist she is convinced: " Patience is not my strong, perhaps it is my sore."
In the end, after a frustrated rapprochement with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies that he is crying is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the sore I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must go very long.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narration that called praise of invention, where the finger in the sore is not named but at one point it is discovered.
With brushes of magical realism, account of a famous sorceress, who played clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that had lost a maiden, narration that turned to speak then America, the great novel that his own chroniclers did not miss from the beginning and quoted Bernal Díaz of the Castle who criticized the excesses of what was told by the conquering captains.
"Some people who invented us all (the writers) made mockery of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise they would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination that was lacking to the point of modesty."
However, he stressed "it is the crazy and the ambushes that best imagine" and it is where reality and lie converges, where it is no longer known that of the narrated belongs to one side or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
It's actually called the "cervantine tradition."
"For his inheritance we are what one can tell."
In her turn, writer Mayra Montero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations that gave rise to the invitation of the FIL with her round table The finger in the wound.
The Cuban-Porturician woman pointed her towards the great scourge of social violence that is going through her country - and shares Latin America - as a result of the drug trade and sale disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the writer's committed work".
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatism, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
"To be the owners of our thinking and to be the owners of reality we have to mattize: and mattizing often means putting the finger in the wound and molesting those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuances and also molesting the powers that prefer a black and white world," he said, inviting us to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the mourning of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the end, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the end, he has had high levels in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinean has ended up consoling himself with the medal of the sub-champion, has remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist arrived at his first final as a coach at the 2002 Open Tournament, when he carried the reins of the Morelia with which he fell overall by 4-2 before Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closure he also came to the decisive duel and also lost it with global by 3-1 and went precisely to Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again in front of the Devils, Rubén suffered a setback, as his team ended up tied 2-2 to the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the set of penalties he got ahead by 3-1 with two chances to seal the title for finally three of his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the voltorette 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore does not want to run the same luck, seeks to get rid of the evil and to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that for him the most important is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and as a result the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," the tymonell said when he questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very effective has the previous ending, of which, he says, has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can't celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players also, because the previous time, with two criminals to throw we were already prepared to run out and I think that's a teaching, until the game is over we can celebrate".
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shots, something that does not worry you, because trusts its players: "One never seeks to reach the range of penals, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately made a bad play the fate, sometimes because of the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but left us, that leaves us something for this end that we hope not to reach that instance".
Roman has in his hands to stop being a technical sub-champion and to prove for the first time the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules to get visa
People should go to Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and the waiting time will be lower.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff shall take the biometric information of the applicant, which shall be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases with a request (including temporary workers' visas) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
People wishing to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken in the CSA, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this less time than in the past.
Likewise, those applying for visas at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra fee of $26.

He'll announce NASA's extraterrestrial life find
The U.S. space agency called on the press to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will release tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there is extraterrestrial life.
The finding will be presented on a press conference tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the one responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In quoting the press, NASA assured that it will present "a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," resulting in speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures at our side and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any way of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and from this ability increases the possibility that similar life might exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will make known the true scope of the findings at tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Patron 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartidism', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence; Ezekiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tronaban' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it gives rise to 'bipartidism', because now it will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, led by the panelist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that these reforms in an institutional way constitute political marginalization on the part of the PRI and PAN.
He explained that in the next few days they will speak with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting with a political will, and if they do not, then they will be resettled by both parties and the opposition coalition has ended.
"So far it has arrived (the opposition coalition), it is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress after having been monopolistic, now be "duopolic".
"It is not the spirit of reforming the law that there is eternal bipathism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other partners to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress now became a 'botin' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're dividing it between two."
Boss Montalvo, he asked to respect the personality of the deputy, he is given his place at the negotiating tables.
"Let not by cupular agreements, let it be left out to 5 that we are probably going to make nine deputies, now to the five who see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify ourselves to seek a place at the negotiating table, that is the subject that in the reform that they made they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200,000 more for "the supplier"
Pay Mazatlan City Council another check to the questioned owner of electrical equipment company.
One more check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount paid in this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200,000 pesos.
According to the city's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200,000 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed to him and therefore how many more checks are missing to be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, he is simply being paid what is due, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the latter of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Law states when a company is questioned by the ESA, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used its services again.
The above, after that on 25 July, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent to attend tourist sites
They regret tourist businessmen accident of the foreign tourist due to bad conditions of the Gloriata Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in bad condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of fate is taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and the banquets have affected because tourists come to walk and see the mess and take the turn to the nearby businesses.
"Politics do not know what it is to close a company one day and have no idea of the money that is lost, or otherwise do not do the works in this way in so long and without proper planning."
Hoteliers José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall exposed the City Council's lack of prevention and maintenance.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so by giving preventive maintenance and not falling only in the corrective," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other places that also look careless and incomplete, he said, like the Shield and the Venadito of Mazatlan.
"Today, in order for the tourist to come not only depends on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleaning on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
"We have not given due attention and this kind of fact puts in evidence something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, as they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city up to date, clean, tidy and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote to the destination."
Request IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A worthy and free labour legislature of agreements between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa facing major problems.
Since yesterday the 60th legislature, consisting of seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one of the PVEM, has been installed, bringing together a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the State is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that do not repeat the same patterns of partyism or paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly released 40 members of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that Members will really exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because it is customary for them to make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnival companions of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
Hence he said that they would certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that would advance the Governor in turn.
"We take care that they come to do a decent job and above all committed to society and the sectors because it was the Signatorians who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that in some way will encourage job creation."
As for tourism activity, he asked that the new legislators give him the weight he has within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretary.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruent as important economic activity and generating foreign exchange and investment and that directly competes with agro-industry."
In addition to the need to label resources for detonating tourism projects, which help to provide security to the state and update to the Alcohol Law that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
Looking for a magician king
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For his parents, the next King's Day will be difficult to please his illusions, as his home is made up of nothing but 12 people and a key.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and live daily because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Sometimes we see her hard because my husband has no chamba, but we sell Mandarin and Dad... I already go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street in the afternoon," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bike, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10 years old, has long aspired to have a "monster" car and for his brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I told him 'let's go see son', because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled with sadness.
For older children, those in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while Michael, 8 years old, uses size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, lacks tennis, so a pair of sizes five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign Find a Wizard King, donating a toy or cash at the reception of Northwest.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions were carried out as part of the dismantling of a network of Cannabis production and sale.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
Persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places where drug production was carried out.
"About 750 plants of Cannabis have been seized, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment destined for production," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec Security spokesman.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged network leaders, two Sherbrooke men.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse in the hours following their arrest.
They could face accusations of Cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
"It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to make the arrests," says Mr. Ruel.
In this police operation, approximately seventy officers from the Estrie de la Sécurité de Québec investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated.
It will be possible to fight illegal migration without problems
The Conservative bill, which the Government believes should address the problem of the paternal burden of illegal migrants, will surely face great opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the Charter."
"I meet here with a party that has created the granite that you step on," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Quebec Block leader, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he pointed to the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected from a pen the criticisms that indicate that her party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
"New Democrats agree that action will be taken against those in charge of the illegal pateras, and that is what we want with another bill, the C-35," says Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," explains Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused parties of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this type of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and treat the country as if it were a slump."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a Conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request a vote to be taken so that each member of Parliament who is going to object is then explained to their constituents.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation committee on the matter.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation has been involved since January last year.
Metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, Tuesday's announcement has caught by surprise more than one.
It should be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on the police services in Quebec held on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebec party critic to deal with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement as "a rabbit removed from the spark" and as "a last-minute capuchera solution".
Minister Dutux, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over the possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," he says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr Charest is obsessed with avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is by the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance of the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this dead end, he suggests that Quebec grant a special mandate to the general intervener to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general intervener," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could give the interventioner the same powers as a Commissioner, thereby enabling him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent team is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to be made by the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this subject.
During Operation Spring 2001 relating to motorcycle groups, although the Penal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being closely monitored due to the severe rainfall in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslides in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
At night, there was another landslides in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
Also, an additional 20 to 40 millimetres are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors located north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations are added to the melting of snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, there is fear that several rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued warnings for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and in the oak, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to be cleared in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflowing of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit remains vigilant and closely monitors the situation, as indicated by Annik Bouchard, Security Adviser.
The Quebec Growth Forecasting Centre, for its part, issued on Wednesday announcements communicating the strong growths of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Wolf.
Partially blame Dupont
Quebec's radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback to the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as for their rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "unexact information on social assistance, improperly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day".
The Council also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
CCNR had received a number of complaints regarding comments made on emissions from 2008 to 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint by the Common Front of Persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters should report reliable data and not lead to deception.
Regarding suicide, the present Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"Most of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont le midi" have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Therefore, any fault has been dismissed in this regard.
The last dispute concerned statements made following the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had witnessed a media confrontation that had sparked numerous reactions.
CHOI's presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I have already completed my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of rude language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio network has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences shall be minimal for the broadcaster, which shall, inter alia, announce the decisions once in the hours of the largest hearing within three days.
A Kung-fu King in Montreal
The watchmaker of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai boxing, goes up to the world's tatamis and ringes in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," Zemmal explained, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the game on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of UPS, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals in the World Amateur Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and thai boxing," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the World Cup of San Shu in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished among the first four positions in the last championship in the world in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been making progress in every competition."
"At this stage, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China in which it is allowed to punch with the fists and feet, as well as to throw the adversaries to the ground.
The clashes were originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous fighter in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only hold a competition in his career, he will definitely go to the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is China's most notorious and prestigious," explains the friendly boy.
"It's like the equivalent of the Lumpinee stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand). "
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"The one who won me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals are faced at the end of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face each other to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without invitations to tender
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the centre of this avalanche of over 100 contracts is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor companies, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the project management one, for an amount of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energy Stewardship, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy Stewardship consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause price rises.
"This is a new method of collusion and elimination of competition."
"That is, people, instead of secretly doing it, now do it openly," said yesterday the Quebec Party MP Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how it can benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, strongly denying that there has been a collusion with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted in a "dishonest" and "with lack of rigour."
He pointed out that "the least" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, this is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the scale of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been awarded without competition; it has been negotiated.
Moreover, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the consortium formula in the technical advisory sector is being investigated by the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's business register allows us to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Stewardship consortium, Minister Normandeau has emphasized that "the territory of James Bay responds to a particular labour dynamic and Hydro-Québec specifically responds to it since the 1970s."
The great head of the Eastmain Project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'Energie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you answer a bid and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the actors in the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Energy Stewardship Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Energy Stewardship.
All contracts were negotiated.
A total of $449,783,344, including the Stewardship Energy contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance it", before specifying that it is more about their leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The label "green" does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer hardly trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade marks or eco-certificates to guide their elections.
According to the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that defend a more responsible consumption are pushed, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even slows down its commitment.
Even if the consumption of so-called "socially responsible" products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measuring tool developed by the Consumer Observatory responsible for the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of the official certificates bearing the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "responsible", the Barometer points out.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any event, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumer sector, which is currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the loopholes and the dubious nature of the information cause 46 per cent of consumers to reject this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers claim to be suspicious of the alleged returns of the ecological products or services they are being tried to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61 per cent have given priority to shopping in the shops in their neighbourhood and have preferred to buy grown food in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points over a maximum of one hundred this year), Quebec's Homo consumerus loves to occupy the seat of the recycling king who tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of wildlife.
However, according to the Barometer, this social awareness seems to be door (from his car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared cars to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and walking trips.
A loan for the state to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has requested financial commitment to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after the Angus Society and the Parallel, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, which expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex in the Boulevard Saint-Laurent and to return his true cinematic vocation, have not obtained what they were asking for.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would, in fact, be less than initial expectations; it could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million, but since then the applications have been reviewed downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, sent a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent him a last report a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have a deadline until 31 December to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation should be completely discarded.
Let us remember that the Association of Cinematographic Hall Owners and Cinematographic Complexes of Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not fund real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, a number of representatives of the sector do demand considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has for ten years carried the burden of the author's cinema on its premises of the complex, after financing its own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Board.
The lack of independent film rooms is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to loyalty its clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are pushing for a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to open their way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallel, continues to project films in eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, projecting Xavier Beauvois' precious film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not again contacted Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group feel about the downside proposals they have received.
It lifts the veil of Canada complexed...
New U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers to be the Canadian complex vis-à-vis the U.S., but at the same time reflect their sense of superiority towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don't think about Canada-U.S. relations when they're going to vote and believe President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government get their budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details that really contain substantial.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, that is, during the full federal election campaign, relates to the extent to which the United States does not get into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of inferiority practically inherent to Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 Free Trade Campaign), " he writes.
Therefore, it concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The ambassador has even more problems understanding this "sudden silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, of a party and, even more, of a party leader to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which voters should think when voting."
This feeling of importance can also be seen the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"His trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will first register deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40 billion," says Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that opposition parties conditioned its survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image of the drama series broadcast on the CBC in the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the issuance of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even kidnappings for the CIA to carry out vigorous interrogations.
Another cable reports that, during its first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied that yes, but that it depended "on each case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote, "he delivered a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the moods have been heated in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC radio that the person responsible for this mass escape should be "murdered."
Mike Huckabee echoes in the United States.
A Global Plan to Refurbish Lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) in a quantity that corresponds to almost one third of the additional decrease to be carried out to stabilize the climate of the planet by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major specific projects that the United Nations hopes will be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, are replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet would be avoided to illuminate humans.
Lighting accounts for 8 per cent of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of emissions from the planetary fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should be further reduced to stabilize by 2020 the increase in temperatures by two degrees centigrade in order to avoid uncontrolled.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, energy consumption is further reduced twice as much.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the Philips manufacturer this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with reostats and emit very little heat.
Above all, they contain no mercury.
Various specialists have expressed their reservations regarding fluocompact light bulbs, since they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluocompact bulbs, but coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that melts with incandescent bulbs.
Only in the United States do these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save billion dollars a year on electricity and eight million tons of CO2, i.e. the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants costing 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast looks forward to the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," said a spokesman for the head of the UN.
"Call on all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and the institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the deadline to pass from Wednesday to midnight without the results being published, three days since Sunday's scrutiny.
Around forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the President of the CIS had commented on television that the commission "was still working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday the demands for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied in the world.
However, Gbagbo's side has been overturned by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former New Forces (FN) rebellion since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the president of Côte d'Ivoire, has said that the intimidation maneuvers of the voters carried out by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the followers of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be overturned if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in the publication of the results "inacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second presidential round, on Sunday, should have put the guinda in the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the political class in Côte d'Ivoire that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished on the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who received publicly the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent on mainland territory (9.7 per cent taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the seasonally adjusted data (EVC) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of unemployed remains 2,631,000 in mainland France.
Data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the working population on mainland territory and 9.7% with the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, whether they are available within two weeks to work or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate up to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older people, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points both in three months and in one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, which amounts to 6.6% with the DOMs.
Unemployment has only been stable among persons aged 25 to 49 years, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Since 2006, the Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public property, cover-up, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, as stated by her lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions asked by the magistrate, not ghosts."
"It's easy to chase him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them," said AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client's appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began to investigate and also imprisoned one of their close people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing your client has done has been to take care of the landfills he must manage.
As to the allocation of contracts or the allocation of funds related to their implementation, he knows nothing about it, according to counsel Simon.
As part of this dossier, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the urban agglomeration services of Aubagne, has also been under investigation since Wednesday, due to misappropriation of funds and complicity, but has been released on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The investigating magistrate has taken account of the explanations and released him," explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
From Tuesday to Wednesday, four other persons were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused of "traffic influence and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned by "abstracting and embezzlement of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and by "complicity in the embezzlement of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "covery of the abuse of social goods".
Among the people who have faced Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have a service to whitewash the capital of great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the research points out that the research focuses especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the waste from Aubagne, as well as other cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elisha has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", has had in vile to the public in France, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Elisha has explained his strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own "rehens" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not occur in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and sought by American justice for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the crude reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that the Syrian President, Bashar Al-Assad, had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French Comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
Eliseo's advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by Quai d'Orsay's director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own forcibly detained citizens to Iran.
"Noise," they say, "continuously release" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "inocence," "immediate release."
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often still."
Because, once attempts to negotiate through discrete channels have been exhausted, "the silence will solve nothing", the Iranians are "experts in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "an ordinary Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day he takes refuge in the French embassy) "will require the Iranians to pay a large amount of money" (€230,000 reward).
In addition, he notes that Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge's decision.
The American embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of material for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France accept an exchange?
Free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assured that he did not.
Elisha, he says, not only "has been greatly surprised by the judge's decision", but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot annul the decision" judicial, he says.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is still under "extreme" surveillance of French information services.
Eliseo's advisor dials a telephone number, hangs up, and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in buildings in Paris run by the Iranian embassy."
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elisha did not spare any effort, he used press releases and "fleets" organized in the media to make him believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad played an "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and verify that manipulation brings its fruit, as several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions the media 'blitz' of French officials.
To what do we owe such "gratitude" to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials admit in private that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The great communication effort "is intended to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria", he believes.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, had just been prematurely and undeservedly spotted".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris tries "to show Syria the praises it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The objective is also "to sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows that from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided in him: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we've thanked you."
"At least this should cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in Elisha.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria who had played an "active role in favour of the liberation of our compatriot".
From midnight, Korean youth can't play online
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Cinderella" that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight blocking their access, as government officials have indicated.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under 16 years of age, according to representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then they find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, Minister responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6:00 in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, precise.
The government also intends to ask companies to limit daily access time to these games when the parents of young people so request, added the person responsible.
In addition, it will make available to anyone who requests free software to limit Internet connection time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly give news about various facts linked to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the indisputable champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced another 58 countries.
World 2018-2022: FIFA designates organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by the suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee designates on Thursday the organizing countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political choice where the struggles of influence and lobbying can come to precedence over the technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of Belgian and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests that are at stake in a World Cup.
Back-to-back transactions, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidatures have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the opportunities of his country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood on Monday by disseminating a documentary that has highlighted three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to displease FIFA and shame the British officials, who have launched an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the head.
The Head of Government hopes to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had managed to organize the J.O.O.O. in London in 2005.
This intense activity, will it be enough to recover the brilliance of England before the EC?
It is not clear, since the duo Spain-Portugal also has numerous strengths thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (World of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the gloomy economic and financial prospects of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal are the only thing that they achieve is to give points to Russia, converted into an outsider of weight despite the gaps in their candidacy (stations, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced a "unfair competence in the preparation of the vote" in a direct reference to the charges of the English press against the members of the EC.
"They're pulling out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which had the experience of 1994, seemed to be the most logical favourites.
First world economic power and headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed a separate excellent project.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities by 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be adversely affected by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted it.
Mitterrand had come to understand that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less yet.
One term in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of State will again be a candidate in 2012.
However, evidence of this does not match well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear to be doubtful.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15th, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would take his decision "at some point in autumn 2011".
Therefore, the fact that it deals with the MPs of the UMP, on Tuesday night in Elisha, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some upheaval.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year mandates to two.
I was just passing on the facts, not an announcement.
It's not the first time you've talked about the presidents, with a playful tone, in meetings of this kind.
"In the worst, or rather, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I won't think about what will come next."
His statements before yesterday do not bring him closer to the candidacy, nor less.
They leave comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has gone up to the lecture which leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Rather on the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many PS people to claim that the battle is organized ahead of schedule.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the issue," he immediately and prudently reacted to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Board of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the modalities for exiting the crisis or at least to announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations which should end at the end of the year.
Due to the European sovereign debt crisis, Frankfurt's issuing institute will certainly not be able to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk worsening a more than complicated situation today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, supported the ECB's active role in resolving the European debt crisis.
He did not want to say whether he considered that the central bank should do more, e.g. by increasing its government bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."...
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing with the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no longer eloquent about his intentions, indicating only that the State Letters purchase programme on the secondary market "continue" and that "we will see what we decide" during the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main type unchanged at 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of Treasury bonds by the ECB has doubled last week to nearly EUR 1,350 million.
Moreover, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday he would have bought Irish and Portuguese securities again.
In total, the central banks of the eurosystem have acquired securities amounting to €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that the purchases will continue (see page 29).
Nor do economists foresee any significant changes in course.
Although lending operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on beneficial terms and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I can't imagine you're going to change your program considerably."
"If not, it would run the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive departure announced during the first quarter of 2011," says Norbert Bräms, economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of such obligations in order for the market to remain stable", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to sovereign euro area debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in returns paid by the most fragile states," said a major bond manager yesterday.
Because, if interest rates are put in the clouds, States will have even more problems in reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi capea the temporal
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of the types of obligations at 10 years.
A recovery from precarious calm.
Following a meeting with the Minister of Economics, the regional presidents have stated that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indescipherable" and that a "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the person concerned.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record figure of 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy risk coverage contracts (CRQs) had been fired up to 263 points, causing a certain stir in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third euro-zone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have meant a jar of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the budget under review in the Senate is based on 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the government deficit will account for 4.3 per cent of GDP next year (compared to 3.9 per cent planned by the government) and 3.5 per cent in 2012 (instead of 2.7 per cent).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the holidays, amounting to 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken", says Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of his economy are in order and his accounts in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the Italian International Monetary Fund responsible for the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are smaller than those required from other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections could be anticipated by the end of March.
In such a case, a period that is not conducive to decision-making would open up in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that we have already demonstrated on Sunday, at night and in the day, that Europeans are clearly solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday in the types of European States' obligations has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a principle of standardisation.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most common target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems," says the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets".
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, the European countries intensify discussions to strengthen the mechanisms for exiting the already existing crisis.
Informal consultations between finance ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
This also takes into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin in early next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started on Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform investors from the Far East about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first EEF securities issues are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official representative told Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries on the front line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms complement austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path to which Greece and Ireland followed.
They both want to avoid asking for international aid at all costs before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that they consider essential to build confidence in a lasting way.
The capitalist partners of the European funds, lastly, come up with the options available to speed up the process of standardisation of public bond markets.
By way of Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that if the EUR 75 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again.
Barclays Capital economists, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider that an additional €10 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently has EUR 60 billion.
A council that could undoubtedly examine the European capitals in detail.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 orange alert departments
Snows continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Brittany, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Weather France, the heavy snowfalls affect north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on the island of France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm are expected, at a time between 7 and 10 cm, in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Isla de France and Lemosín.
Snows are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, weather France alerts.
In Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes, has been prohibited.
According to the gendarmes, circulation in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that it not be conducted except in case of need and the movement of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
On Thursday, school transport in Picardy has been banned.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "instrains all drivers to drive with the utmost prudence on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25 per cent of their flights at Roissy Paris airport on Thursday and 10 per cent in Orly due to planned snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: First Financial Drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on the island of France has reached its peak, billions of dollars have rained.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of €4 billion.
At the theoretical level, this sum will be the one that will then allow the GSP to obtain market loans to finance part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 law on amending finance, discussed at the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in the tax on offices on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
Moreover, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernise it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it's far from 4 billion.
"It is necessary that tax resources are added to the €4 billion allocation of funds that will be mobilised by the State and that will be granted to Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as explained."
"It shall be recorded in the budget and used in accordance with the requirements."
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the $4 billion pledged is not included in the credit, can lead to a slightly lit parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Avenger hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous at the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (independent of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's sinisterly ridiculous profile has long been giving Cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule that secret records should only be made up of news of public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or don't know where to look for news about the nonexistent), but because those who engage in occultism not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they have already learned.
This is Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or he has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if it could not be, I know, libération editor), who only considers what he can recognize true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the American Embassy of Rome to the State Department was the same information published by Newsweek the previous week.
Then why have the revelations of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that the embassies, at least since World War II and since the heads of States can call on the telephone or catch the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of limited representation exercises, have become spy centres.
Any viewer who sees research films knows perfectly well, we just seem to know that we don't know it because of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "Verdugos".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Previously, in Orwell's time, he could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as is now the case, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer hold its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but revealing, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means taking away all power from it.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put on the network any confidential information, since it would be like publishing it on a sign on the street.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, we cannot expect to have confidential conversations over the telephone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a Head of State has flown and contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my prediction is a science fiction thing and, therefore, a new one, but I imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligence with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at the very least, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
This information is then stored in a single copy in locked drawers: after all, the attempt to spy on Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a telegraph with cables (telephones).
The video tapes (analogues) had allowed cinema researchers to study a film step by step, advancing and retreating, discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (digital) only allow moving or going back from chapter to chapter, i.e. to huge proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can travel from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the trips it carries, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that communication policy and techniques take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
Previously, the press was trying to understand what was being done secretly in the embassies.
Currently, it is the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: France's headlines in its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to consider whether the rapidly unlocked funding promises (called fast start or early) made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French hats have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.260 million (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation proved appreciable and was appreciated for what was really worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion, placing it on the right track towards fulfilling its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without harming official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, everyone chooses the most suitable reference.
For example, the European Commission has taken the year 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained and 150 million are added in three years for fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to previous years ' expenditure or the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while it seeks to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element is the sharing of donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and each chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that each euro borrowed is equivalent to a euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (frequently, projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is false to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... As a lot, only the cost of the loan for the country that grants the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be calculated for its commitments.
But France does not find such reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% of loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million); consult the EU document to see it in its own eyes.
This is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it in 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes a euro to fulfil its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France is doing a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
By spending only 36.1 million euros, he gets the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early financing is a short-term, short-term one in relation to all climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it doesn't.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could make progress in the discussions on the stakes at stake in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional nature" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive in relation to this issue as it is with others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of the "additional nature" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the negotiations.
Warning on pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old ingests 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Generations Futures association (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with", acquired in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that usually consume a child of about ten years at four meals and one snack per day.
These meals taken as a model, which respect official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as candy, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Although in virtually all cases the legal limits for each individual chemical are not exceeded, our study clearly shows that exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic pollutants and/or PE is of concern," says the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea contain by themselves more than a dozen possible cancer residues and three considered safe cancers, as well as about twenty residues that may harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as intended for school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a prohibited fungicide in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in food, where the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian steak, canned tuna and even the bread bar or gum were fitted with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutritive" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk that these "pollutant cocktails" generate to the consumer is "probably underestimated," says the study.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "against the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
