The UKIP residents who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says that NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, it answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks if people living with HIV are included in unwanted ones.
First you use specious arguments, then you discredit them by a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to queue behind chronic hypochondria intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think you're the one who uses specious arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing fools, hardly exists.
I think that's what we call democracy.
Then no one would be affected by UKIP's measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quotation from a towel is not evidence.
Yeah, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail didn't write the report, he just commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate on homophobia charges.
Farage's sentence was very surprised, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to be able to get over it.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don't like it when the media talk about what you don't like.
We rarely talk about it because unlike Farage and his crazy followers of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of god and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, so no.
Finally, the situation in Ireland is as bad as in Spain.
With the new crisis that comes the period of austerity will not have arranged anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland's ''TIGRE DE L'EUROPE''' was bragging about us a few years ago.
We've met the rest of us!
This recommenced to read the article.
There is an attempt to make Ireland believe that it is a virtuous country and that a '' NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE''' is happening.
With the agreement of Brussels, imposed on the lowest companies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients not what ''pave'' at the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 1980s of the twentieth century, irlance was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with the portugal In considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
The Greek was ahead.
That their development has not been a long, quiet river, it is on account of recent events.
The lowest rate of taxes in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If it is believed that a report was released in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new cars (and kere) all over the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily plugs since the start.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon ignite.
In another article that they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hit on the A140.
Is Ryanair now planning to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so a few bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That's what I'm stealing with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two when they're scraped.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair charge passengers an extra fee for the additional fear we wanted to provide them with?
But without that kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can enjoy it.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair to those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic tariff have to take it themselves, etc.
That's pretty transparent.
Ryanair is not going to be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that this was a mistake for airport air traffic controllers.
Passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your compensation dreams.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a nice trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally hails from the world.
People do not come in mass for the quality of the restaurants (some, for the most part) or for the Salon de la revue à l'Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly alive and lively.
With a lot of foreigners spending...
Do you think Sunday's opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, full of people with 50% tourists.
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that would seem admissible to me is that of areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy in detax.
Tourism areas lose a considerable amount of turnover each year for the same reasons .
There is still the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed, with the exception of employees.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister responsible for the economy, nor the Minister responsible for foreign affairs, have the slightest competence to reform the labour code.
As they close it.
What's the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies who want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sunday apm I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my city of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is the access to culture...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against her will, used to pay the inheritance costs?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some are terrible.
Probably his estate would want his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Me neither.
But for five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 He held the lead to the other aristocrats of the government who wanted to discuss a "agreement" with the Nazis and he very skillfully won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had for these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That its descendants sell the paintings on the free market to collect the money from the inheritance fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one of them in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was "the moment of truth", Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only encourage large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, with infrastructure works by definition not being renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect the true French evil: the distrust of dialogue
Back to the princeps values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Either in solidarity we come to his help, or he has DROIT in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the lessor who lives income from his properties.
It is necessary to differentiate between the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives from his annuities.
One good to rent or two for a couple above, it's vice
The little genius of Finance is indistinctly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of poor infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline emerges in response to a recession that is only a savage, therefore brutal, decline.
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, highways...
But if one wants to make less harsh the future climate-energy shock, then the need for investments is crying out: isolation, renovation of the railway network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc...
A tax that favours high income and annuitants.
Who's in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallop.
Samsung's benefits are undermined by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple's mid-September introduction of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided on LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple's benefit.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft put this philosophy in place, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I like design.
Some people don't attach any value to design, for them the options, functionality and price prevail.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform."
Is there a "better car manufacturer," not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving portable industry, with radically different approaches to different people and markets.
It's healthier and needs to be encouraged.
This is in our best interest.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who according to one of them fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, well on Parisian bobos) could tell us which author(s) they fight ideas about gender and tell us the works they intend to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in The Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemour?
Well, Jean, I like you, and you're someone smart and cultured.
I said that about Judith in Furusato's vein evoking Holopherne, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I don't have his spirit vivacity).
Otherwise, in the "bottom", since you are referring to it, this subject does not interest me, and I honestly don't see what the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my backwardness, because I am slow but I understand well...
@ Jean: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith to Holopherne, that does.
Who's afraid is asking the world?
But what are those who are afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us response elements.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic gorge slicer.
We can see how intimate these studies affect them.
We are obviously no longer in the debate on ideas.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
To fight ideas from the only presentation that their detractors make (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Genre or X Lacroix , theologian ) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it's all the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I haven't read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I've contented myself with the "Second sex" (it was more of my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed itself when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a little for the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really lock the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Special blood moon flash.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey make the lab responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will return its true colour as soon as possible.
It's obsessing, isn't it?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week of the meteor shower of the Perseids and for almost all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm beginning to think there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to keep the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are greatly improving on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn't see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'll put a TAXE on that eclipse.
Whoever looks at this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will you be obsessed with when he ends up (forcefully) disappearing?
It seems that you spent a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accusing EUX of being obsessed.
Beautiful picture of the moon above the Harbour Bridge of Sydney.
Looks like Mars is going to get into a collision with Earth!
Nothing about stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing on the inequalities between income from labour and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
There is no hypertext link to the original documents so that an opinion can be made.
Go to see today Tuesday, October 15th the results of the miraculous recipes: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest for five years.
In Greece the scholarship collapses.
Yet these are the examples to be followed.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation of the order of €8 billion.
The Department of Economics states that these claims are not well-founded.
What if the Ministry of Economics made a mistake?
Will policymakers have the same courage when presenting the invoice to the state budget?
The rest of his time.
Okay, thank you, JYL....
@lol No the state is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget because the temporal horizon of the state is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifetime of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered to be unproductive, it contributes to the financing of material and intangible investments in the growth of tomorrow and thus future revenues.
A few elements of response.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of world pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not correspond to your fantasy.
Medical personnel would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands bound by the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgery, safe shoot rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the uncultivated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with drugs Since the Liberals want our health care system to look like the U.S., you should find out how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but this is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame the toubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to business profits and "research".
Read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare world prices of medicines everywhere, as well as differences between countries on what is on free sale or only on prescription.
This is reinforced by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against cancer pain, despite the laws that stop them and the expensive permits required.
Although manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy with alternatives such as marijuana, those who arrive at a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a person in charge of this hospital.
We can't hold patents on grass...
If "researchers" in social sciences did research instead of politics and networking, they could use their "work."
One researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
It's not looking to compare.
To compare is to do pedagogy not search.
It is not possible to say "research is completed it has to be applied" and then in a single jet "must experiment with everything".
If your research is complete, why experiment?
If your research is not complete, why do you ask us to apply it?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other materials?
New technologies help to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they don't know how to learn?
Pisa tests are only an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the point of building an indicator that tells you what you're up to, a self-promotion will, a deception?
Only one way to train teachers is to distance sophists and ideologists from training and practitioners teach practitioners.
factory reread the paragraph on internships (which unfortunately is not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us to the most inefficient conservatism: "It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of existing practices, and that does not allow to advance the system ".
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, one cannot wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in modern teacher training.
Education theorists must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Giving more weight to the theorists of education would definitely destroy it.
Your analogy is totally wrong: if I don't want to be operated by a practitioner who only has a theoretical training, I would like to get operated by a surgeon who doesn't have any theoretical training and who has learned about the task.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP in charge of the fight against copyright violation by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright, I will simply read an article like this.
In an information economy, the violation of copyright = vol.
This is the same because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often getting a license doesn't cost anything.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not at all the same thing.
By using content without having the proper license, you deprive the artists of their livelihood.
You can always debate pedantic assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't turn out to be true.
It's a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright
You obviously don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school homework, an almost perfect definition of what should be reasonable use, then I'm happy to deprive them of that fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the general conditions that they have passed by one click.
Maybe if they share the headphones of their mp3 walker with a friend on the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah, if we could export this resource that we're replenishing, the rascal who says it's all wrong....
If it's a PS MP who says so, then we have to believe it.
I have two children and when they are able to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed since then.
France pulls people down by constantly assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What drives France down, it's speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in private business forever.
I had the CHANCE for working in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm an employee because I know I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls at the bad bosses I meet frequently.
At ease in my basketball I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he speaks the horrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with the German companies that the French entrepreneurs constantly quote to ask for reforms in France, in Germany the companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between the big companies and the medium and small - What do the French bosses expect to do with it so much??
Is the state holding hands with them?
That state they're accusing of empire?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couplet from you!
Remind me, what have you created as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is facing an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French entrepreneurs unable to create jobs and who are bouncing and minauding while waiting for the permanent assistance of the State!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employers' charges, taxes, working 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages or their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
What's ironic is how people always complain about First Group.
From what I see from where I am, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep going rather than transform themselves.
That doesn't mean that the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that, unfortunately.
I tried to get them recently, but I couldn't.
But, well, Labour is gonna get us out of trouble, isn't it...
It's an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
There is nothing to prevent people in the UK from creating a more moral enterprise and taking part in bidding.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all this so that the decision was finally overturned.
And there's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company has won Crossrail's operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they repeated to us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and believes that workers must all help each other across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision ;)
It may be because the management of the Dutch is on good track while the management of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change in ownership but especially new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a beating girl."
God, I hate it, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "beating" is a quality superior to many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "battling", who are no less dead, I know of them palanquées.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, let's start again, too.
I'm not telling you it's THE condition to manage, I'm telling you it helps.
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When in the examples of your life, there are only you to judge them.
I'm starting again.
Insinuating, if only for a moment, that one can have merit to get out of a disease or that one can demerit not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that lets go, from everywhere, despite the will, despite the confidence in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C is?
I'm sorry to think the opposite, if having a solid morale makes it easier to accept and prepare for heavy treatments, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not refuse them out of fear..
Someone who's battling in medicine, it's primarily someone who trusts medicine.
But if we'd rather get back to the "seigneur" it's something else.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you get stripped to the point of just becoming a zombie.
Personally, I caught two of them, dirt, fat guys, and if I got beaten up like these fine psychologists say, it totally escaped me.
Unless this fight is just about tightening your teeth, suffering hell and beatings.
I thought the charge against Milosevic had been settled and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers in at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted "quickly" and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story we told back then?
The Communist who became a nationalist who launched three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please question what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under THE LEAST Rule of International Law?
What country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians, and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he was defending him, he'd be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was readily recognized by the Western states that then lied from end to end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term in office because he could not understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as a tyrant (even if we did not love him).
To my knowledge there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece that works about, measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This kind of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
A hope therefore but the prudence is of put This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from the Earth in the Cygnus constellation which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study conducted by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine's team at the University of Maryland.
Method to be followed.
Just like those involving animals feeling a threat coming.
Thank you Passeur de sciences for giving us, often, these experimental feats that are realized in the world.
How do animals know (in advance )?
Probably through the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of earthquakes.
Like radon, for example.
An a priori odourless gas for man but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments at his disposal.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs, but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report telling the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to have their work on the sensitivity of animals to ground magnetic fields recognized, and especially their modification before a earthquake.
So of course I'm not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me!
Where are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature again...
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious review, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by the animals, we encounter the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned strangely round.
I don't understand that we can think Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to LBC's program you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and that he's always trying to have fun with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor and he didn't keep one.
It just points out how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, doesn't it?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and people have been taught the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and it will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the lead of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will bite the ceiling I'm sure of it.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one of them.
That's exactly what we said about the Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than him.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French have really and always disinterested themselves in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have given themselves the pain to read a few books (there are some, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "threat of scrap" speak, unfortunately as much as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be in the background since the battle of Savo) do not want to go back there.
We actually passed in front of the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission is over.
It's the little ones.
But the green side is a total smoke.
Calculate kerozen consumes to achieve the objective totally decredibilizes the concept..
Just go through the list of sponsors than philanthropists.
One more com operation doesn't do or do.
The cow, it gives too much desire!!!
I look forward to the web series!
Your recit makes me review, identifying myself a little at the crossing (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn at the White Mill in Brest!).
Also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to have us reviewed, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travelers!
Pierre, Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think the red hat that has manifested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Region of Brittany and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not spend a penny of our taxes to finance the dreams of even a few adventurers as sympathetic as those!
Are there players in the current Serbian formation of Kosovar origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still on the team
Bisevac is the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a midfielder or forward in the 1970s and 1980s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the great Velez team, which, under the supervision of legendary Suleman Rebac, finished second in the Yugoslav league twice (and also had scores such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful teammate of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
They said he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he's currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and as far as I know he's not a holder.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbours.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of true Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Great Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (that I know of).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give ends of the country to neighbouring countries.
How can one have felt "an explosion of joy" by seeing two laps collapse knowing that women, men, and children's undivided are inside?
How?
What bothers me a little in this "witness", is that the only fact that I could, if only once, spontaneously rejoice at the horrific death of thousands of people, is in my view a personality "border line" whose "witnesses" should be taken with the greatest caution.
No doubt at the short time of "joy", we have not thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
We will just have thought, for a moment, that for once Muslims had managed to do truly and apocalypticly evil to the great wicked Satan in his very heart.
To make qqch powerful.
Great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims snored by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We were wondering a little bit.
The western "Christian/White/Galulian" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the muslim when it contemplates the general misery, social and cultural underdevelopment of the Muslim Arab world of today.
I am talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this devilish funnel?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world l: the bigot conservatism of the powers in place and the fascinating nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That we've understood before, we mustn't turn the Muslims back.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as much as the summer green when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls a weekend.
We had a nice summer this year, don't do your grumpy who rattles clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop immunity to outside germs anymore, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful step full of intoxicating smells, with a febrile that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risk of snowfall and plenty of other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the control of child enhancements , it is the amount paid by the State that comes mainly from deciles 8 to 10 .
However , with regard to the number of households that have seen their tax increases as a result of this measure , it is mainly deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to Chart 2 .
The elimination of half the share of mainly widows is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not ready to work out.
Well, we're not on straw, but thinkers.
For once the PS does a rather left-wing policy we're not gonna cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let's continue and you will encourage these 20% less to work or to leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm still saying it.
Long live the Trots and OCI recycled to the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population holds 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from amassing as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is exceeded, money is only used to make money, that is to say to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We're one of the richest 20%.
Probably also 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth of which part is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or so much lower your arms and live social minimums, especially if you have social housing.
The utopias of the head cutters at the Khmer Rouge have fortunately lived.
I've done two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or face any trouble.
Just go to someone's house, sleep there, put it behind you and go back.
From now on, this will be my first option when I'm on a trip.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your house.
In most cases you will need some kind of homeowner's insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Oh, six hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No, it's not true.
You just really missed your luck.
Based on the link provided in the article:
At his discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
Then why does this article quote Teman complaining that he did not receive any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello, I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I plan to pay a deposit and a month's rent at once but I'm a little afraid to send £1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
"Supporting the troops" sang the Bu$herie on all the tones...
Innocent weapons, then.
I am sure it will please families and close to thousands of dead Kurds in Halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
This is not very clear about the author's style: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is this the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if they were "made" to work 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers are now earning more than engineers.
And don't let us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programs.
But it doesn't happen because National Education doesn't have the means to provide a college/school office to its teachers so they work at home.
A sort of forced telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay either the computer, internet connection, or supplies.
Besides, it's so much the hideout at 5:00 a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill the math CAPES, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to hang on to poorly-educated clarets whose parents spit on you when you call yourself a jerk?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the Kurdish population can flourish better.
Where we can see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in the London sale to earn three times nothing and yet it was a position for which a degree was needed.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London subway, it was paid £5,000 more per year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I never regretted it.
In this regard, don't worry if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something that pays well or you like to do.
If I'd stayed in graduate jobs, I'd still be paying my student loan.
I don't like business work so much, so I hope to spend time either in the public service or in the university world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Get rid of the bisoneurs as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is to say what we call the diplomas of the unemployed.
I have one of those degrees and I finished production director.
It turned out that the important was not the diploma but, as the article above says, a good career course, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course the starting salary was lower but we quickly climb the steps because in the real world what matters is the results more than knowledge.
This debate has been in the engineering/art sciences studies for years.
Scientists cannot solve all problems, it is more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people in order to get results.
Letters, philosophy, and art are great channels?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about degrees like media study or whatever the abscond course where you went.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real channels.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn't it be better for a real territorial policy to de-engorge Paris and boost the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see the inhabitants of the end-bottom of Essonne and Val-d'Oise doing 80km round-trip every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
The intra-muro and small belt inhabitants already have many other more practical means of public transport (metro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and gated parks, as they already exist in cities in northern Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RMs.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
They may benefit from their great experience in the field.
Well, we didn't find a place for a single bike hanger.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not okay at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other users of public transport the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that emerge are: 1/ it is very dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, those scooters that drive super fast and fuck the survival of bikes 2/ we take full pollution in the head For me the bicycle tracks are fish go, we must reduce the traffic car (urban traffic type load congestion), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), enforce the code of the road by verbalizing systematically (even the bikes to the bemol pres that we have to adapt the code of the road written for cars 100 years ago to the bicycles), generalize the buffer zones after the blocked passages, not before otherwise cars and scooters do not generate.
The cycle paths are apartheid, we must cohabit but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the great Paris?
Not a word on the bike's place in public transport?
EELV's right.
The target of 15% of velo movements is ridiculous.
I'm starting to think that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Moreover, after what OR reports, the EELV assistants seem skeptical.
I'd rather be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, we'd better find out who's really hiding behind this massacre.
Index: it's not Russia.
Not sure you like the way the world evolves.
That sounds awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint was actually filed.
In addition, they should first file complaints in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault is the responsibility of the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had previously been shot down, Ukraine was launching air attacks on the rebels in the area, and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocent people for airlines to pay overflight rights in the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls that defend their usurping government / ultranationalists from Western Ukraine - and who want to show in bulk that Putin shot down flight MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The previous: an International Court of Justice ruling of 1986 which concluded that the provision of weapons by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
No chance Russia would let this case go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott means to Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to substantiate his allegations.
So far the investigators haven't said anything like that.
His name is Ricardo and being such an eco-beast, it's painful!
Calling Polar is losing the north is rejoicing.
A single question from the Beoten: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can't help but notice that those who most virulently criticize Piketty's book haven't read it!
It's easy to read. It's been a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that today's concentration of capital joins that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, it shows that it is the 2 world wars that have reduced the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this Pavé knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limitations.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is right, we can discuss it without reading the book, the main thing of which is to argue in a single sense in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his paper summarized by the press false?
I haven't read and I won't read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and that is the one that seems to me to be pure smoke.
The concept of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has mankind not been enriched overall?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political question today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the prize without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age where most people just start to find their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden on the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes for happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - even in the popular neighbourhoods of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she was not where she is now, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Is Malala herself not part of these "colored perverts"?
You should not have any "antenna time" on this site.
You're a horrible pervert yourself.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when he was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for her to receive higher education and to have the right to decide herself about her marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he believes that women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl must often get married at 14 years of age, without having her say.
I'm sorry she didn't spell it out eloquently enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Rather disappointed by this entry in season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who visibly has a little trouble finding her sosie character from Marlene Dietrich.
I have just looked at the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing Bowie's anachronistic Life on Mars is simply overturning.
I haven't seen this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I'd rather have all of a sudden than watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is on, apart from Jessica Lange extraordinary, it is above all the risks of staging and editing that lie in me.
AHS has an avalanche of original plans that ridicules the aseptization of today's productions.
I'm a little short of seeing you throw the sponge in advance for the next few seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality of it.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many more things.
No it's simply that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is truly ONE of the pillars of the series apart from technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot at her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, she wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2nd it was too dispersed despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end up like 24 hours time what.
But everyone does what they want!
That's why I say "I won't look anymore" that everyone has to do the same!
I simply share my point of view, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal.
But then, here, it's just my opinion.
Let's talk less tax increases, please - let's cut rather in government spending.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to saber in the expenses failed.
Issue controversy over relatively small expenditure items, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than about the change of orientation that voters seem to call their vows and all this time some, in each camp, pretend that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
The "debt" is assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country.
The "debt" is nothing to worry about.
I wouldn't see any problem with the government taking over a third of my income (even before talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it was going to use it properly.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage was not entirely honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, the subsidies to wind turbines almost useless and the nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you arrive at a figure that makes the Labour and Lib-Dem taxes on the most luxurious residences seem ridiculous.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 a year will pay about £5,000 (one seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay about £10 000 (one fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 will pay about £70 000 (just over a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car sticker, and it's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is collected at the source before local taxes and car vignettes.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let us not pretend to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it is not important to know where billions of pounds of tax are going.
How can an unemployed person looking for work at the door-to-door prove it?
Even though 20% of the unemployed would not be looking, that means 80% would be looking and not finding.
As a self-employed person, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
Whether a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances as much.
In fact I haven't heard from Pole Employment in months, does that mean that the agents are more busy in control operations than actually getting job announcements back?
I don't see any interest.
Because it is not for the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then you have to move from Pole Employment.
What is this a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we ensure that the unemployed fulfil their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks users for their transport documents from a means of transport, a head of service or are employees of their work, etc.
Nobody yells at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had business in Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight firm.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
The file and the control take over now, while the statutory Employment Pole is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only employees, they are the ones who pay the costs.
Non-salary policies and French people are granted rights that they do not actually have!
It's not normal.
I would add that decent unemployment insurance contributes to the recovery of wage labour.
More than waiting for killer tweets in Arabic...
In reality, there must be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit to ban this year the Hadj at Mecca to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa application refused because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted the smallpox to Mecca during Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit presence.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane to Europe?
I thought it was simple common sense but apparently those "who know" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those countries of West Africa where Ebola is out of control should be quarantined in strict terms.
No one's going out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were contaminated after having had contact with people in West Africa although they took "all the necessary precautions".
We can stop the advance of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
We forbid them to offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be quarantined immediately.
That he can pass the message of the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he will be able to dogme the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It's still far from that conception there.
It has only been 20 years since the information appeared as the given premium of humanity, while the religion, which came out of the cerebellum, directs our actions from Lucy perhaps.
What is the point of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not anyway set foot in the Church, there is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What's the next step, you take away the notion of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@louise: Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe that will make it possible to touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) respect for others as you envisage pre-existing to the Christian.
Hillel a century earlier said to him: "Don't do to others what you don't want to be done to you, that's the whole Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes far beyond mere reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "progress justice, peace, fraternity" but without god?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: You take away the incarnation and resurrection.
Jesus will remain this hero who has upset moral laws by redefined respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted forcefully and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It's not made up.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even took part in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The jewels of the computer department block all the nice sites.
Hello, is it £30 then 20% discount, or does the £30 include the 20% discount?
Please note, however, that the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Plus I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's crap.
It's time to buy a new video card
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all this: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would be afraid that one day they will erase it from your library if they decide to sift against the people who buy it there while they are out of the planned area.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
Thus, was the France of 1940 a "putrid land"?
So, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Must we love France of 40, the one of "the strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature you wonder if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano who is already difficult to read in French and who describes such a limited and self-centered universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt that.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They'll appreciate it, sir.
Modiano at his fair value, if they don't already know him!
For your part, continue to attend Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retain all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hello, the terrible ones.
Ever since I drove one to Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing's been following me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to Nottingham's beer and cider party.
It was brothel.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not just CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with the camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather's house to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real chance as a beginner I was able to leave with several decent bets.
I hope that if I get to 95, I'll be as bright as he is.
Last night I went to a fancy cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came in with a slice of lard on it.
I admire Mr.
Read Buddha a little bit and you'll understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
Having said that, I don't want to upset you, I think you're getting a little away from the subject.
This famous whole, it forbids quests for the jihadists at the exit of the mosques.
She'll report the gun traffic without delay.
Either we have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
You have to choose.
It's not by keeping your eyes closed that you access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again you make a monumental counter-sense: all the representative authorities, organizations or associations, whether Muslim or not, having formally condemned the IS and its crimes, the French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Who doesn't say a word of consent.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, there is doubt for everyone.
As I said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and to demand that they demonstrate publicly to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt them.
This principle is in my view the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the criminalization of French society.
If there is no doubt, so to speak.
Who says word consent, but consent to what?
They consent to a proximity with EI or to the conviction of EI.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to save the goat and cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, during the elections, "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has widened between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified by the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't give a shit about Scotland because they don't have any seats.
They can do what they want with complete electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Job losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP, which will cut their heads off in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMESS" thinking that he was saving his party but without realizing that he was signing the death penalty for his Scottish deputies.
No wonder some Labour Members are asking their leaders for accounts.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's more important.
Not if the Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected in England one day.
Citing the pumps by 8% at the expense of 85% is not a super election strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs are no longer able to vote on matters concerning England, the Conservatives will win all votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists and it did her good.
However, he is still in the league to be Prime Minister in 2015 and since winning the leadership of the Labour Party.
So basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each player to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is "The Life of Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of the FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
Eventually, it will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next ticket: Amazon makes YOUR book according to YOUR profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's fun as a world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have the reading of pirated files, public domain books or purchased from some publishers who have the intelligence to propose files without a bugger.
Given the price I paid for the Kobo, it's without regret.
I am afraid of the widespread abdication of users in the face of widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your general public bookstore, you will notice systematically that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are probably derisory.
For example » Finnegans Wake » by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the Big Data era, data doesn't really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same tray.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that is so, neither allowing the readers nor the authors to be identified.
But Kobo has all this information, he does.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be led by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic children under acid.
It's even worse than that if you take Erdogan's religious fundamentalism into account.
Interestingly, some supporters of Erdogan think that Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn't want to shoot a bullet in the foot unless it wins something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will fight back, so it's actually shooting a bullet in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: "AP reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sends a serious warning of reprisals or simply advises caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises us is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
The reading of Indian Punchline is to strongly recommend to anyone who pays attention to details rather than to c*neries balanced by the traditional media. The short article of which you link is important and should be read keeping in mind the realistic observations/previous warnings coming from Iran to propose Afghanistan around 1979-1980.
Who are these "moderates" who seriously fight the horrible lay Assad and at the same time the perverses of ISIS?
Pipeline policy pushes the world to the abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to "moderate" non-existents to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"It's even worse than that if you take Erdogan's religious fundamentalism into account" Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one in mind.
A Nuremberg trial would be required for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should we "should"?
Do you realize that neither criminals nor victims have any chance of being alive yet?
A little late for that, buddy...
Wouldn't the criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly concerning the CUP triumvirate that planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the First World War by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a pummeled place in Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
That's crazy!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain contact with the real.
That's a lot of clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in the belly of a carrier mother.
Lesbian couples may simply have a child's desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterilized straight couples, too.
As for the children!
What a shame to designate them as future unbalanced psychological ones.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn a living and to pay for the retirement of this woman (?)
The GPA is probably a provisional "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
She's not dating today.
Many women brought and brought to the world children who were not their husband's.
It's still like this, we're like this...
The important thing in this matter is that this practice is framed so that the "marchandization" of the body is limited.
But the cosmetic surgery, the cosmetics aren't as much body merchandising?
Anakronik Fareinheit...
It is certainly more elegant to make a good in faraway country on the internet and Pay Pal than to wear his responsibilities and or avoid scandal in another century near home without shouting at that time on all the roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done in the name of the church! ...
There are not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices...
However, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.
In the late '70s in the Midlands I only saw this from a distance.
I had to go there all day because I didn't have the right to go there at night!
But if you love it and you listen to music - this music today it always touches you so much.
I don't know why there are so many scornful comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on football that awaits your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a shortage of reports that truly reflect the reality of culture in Northern England.
No wonder Paul Mason grasped the social and political context well, he understands things well.
Northern soul still lives, but it has been vamped by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can listen to it if you are in the London region in November: 99psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotsky in Farringdon.
I myself thought "always the same story," but here's a little well-written and well-thought-out article.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're happy you escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.
Gobting pills.
Whatever the station before Wigan was Ince, 15 min walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the police series George Gently, Gently Northern Soul, which took place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace as he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (by the way, it was also the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters have all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, laid them on the rock and entered the water.
An Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative got angry and shouted, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis were not even there at the time!"
The Palestinian representative (UN) said and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not lower custody ...
What displeases the anti-Israeli people is obvious, this is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And it has always been so since the policy is globalized...
Avoidance, avoid...
In the Israeli-Colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it certainly persists!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What force relationship has allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: The Israeli-Palestine conflict is still a forceful relationship today!
Do you doubt it?!!! ...
Besides, it doesn't just revolve around Russell Brand, but Guardian journalists seem to have trouble going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
A lot of what he says are only pseudo-chomsky ballemies written by no others.
This proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a series of personal attacks and innuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A very vicious charge, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand tells some truths, perhaps truths that one prefers not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be getting more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horriples some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but this whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles/videos that he posted, it says that voting once every five years only for Labour or the Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting the democratic commitment to this is completely useless, the two parties (to slightly different degrees) governing essentially in favor of particular interests, multinational companies and rich, At no time it says to simply ignore the policy completely because these parties do not govern in our name: it insists to say that rather than just vote and disconnect for five years, people should become much more politically active at the local level, organize movements, demonstrations, petitions, whatever and try to influence the policy from that.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active in making his demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are twilighters who will change their mind if they really risk losing the elections), but it is scary to see all these condescending answers that say that this fool who makes Jesus tells the young people not to take the trouble of voting and just hope that everything will be better because it is really distorting his arguments.
Its solution is highly questionable and it would be good if people were to debate what he actually says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The voting thing has been completely distorted.
The point of slipping a ballot into a ballot box every 5 years makes me deeply angry because my vote really doesn't count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and MEPs who report locally to their voters.
In addition, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "Physical-chomsky balleveuses".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, let Suzanne do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the headaches added to the assembly!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him on his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
He draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but which has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
In my view, this "fronde" reveals above all that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the RDV of History where professional historians have become minority and where the exchanges of specialists have been impoverished for the benefit of condensed ready-to-think Sciences Po-type condensed for press files.
For my part, I had seen in Pierre Bourdieu's intellectual attitude as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take on a culprit, a scapegoat.
They develop very rational reasonings, but this rationality rests on these scapegoats which are the key to their thinking.
I think rather that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This is a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magical thought.
We solve the problem of the report to each other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist slope, neo-lib and / or libertarian (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing to go to seek the help of the state for its markets ) in the sense of at least state / not state at all at Foucault .
The old dream of the base that is beautifully self-organizing.
Her thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt she does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals cited here.
Nor any support at all.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of his god of then, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you may have read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet puts a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the mechanism of membership in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
See this cabal orchestrated by hard left humanities researchers who can't stand moving from allegiance to their mantras, is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "yellows" I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I last saw a Chinese guy.
In London and they were sympathetic to me when they learned I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same of whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them speak violently anti-Whites.
My father's not happy that his eldest daughter was dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, the Russians are mostly prejudiced against unqualified temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very lucky to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the river Ienissei, in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard Australians' opinions on Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I can't stand the Chinese, while I've met two of them in my life (one of them abroad), I haven't kept any bad memories, all people are worth it and, in fact, those in London have been very nice that's the only reason I remembered that they were Chinese.
If you don't remember who you meet, all people are worth it, how to remember who you were.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here were talking about Chinese as a sort of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with the so-called White.
How many Chinese men are with white men, by comparison?
None, because there is a great deal of chance that the parents of these Blanches would attack them PHYSICALLY.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
Yet, she is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: I'm sorry, but the courts are frankly a right mark.
When he represents only 25% of the judges at the Union of the Judiciary.
If a measure of bias can be made on the basis of the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
The political vision of the observer as well as the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
Then there remains the necessary tool of the law to refocus the assessment on the fundamentals.
The measure of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including the prosecution, forces a distinction between the error and bias of the magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice do not divide between these three groups.
Pretentiousness and lack of knowledge are not part of an objective analysis.
So if all this is not analysed, how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics that implicitly reveal that it starts from a very low point of view.
The previous preamble makes it possible to correctly enter the following in the third ratio.
That of corruption* of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area under consideration is the depoliation* of heirs committed up to fraud in the proceedings* by successor genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession has won 150 million euros a year, while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the almost judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this coincides with the aforementioned statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution produced, in many disputes between genealogists and reticent heirs to be thus spoiled, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all laws favorable to the heirs.
Is the presentation of European statistics that ignore these kinds of rational criteria not then an elaborate form of lies?
It's probably totally prohibitive prices.
There's more equipment to rip off the handicapped.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these three-cycles all-terrain, custom-built to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors as never a normal wheelchair, with bulky wheels and tires, could not.
Like they say, taste and color...
Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks like an Epic.
I don't think the inventor of Whill ever had to clean up a dog's crust on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all the way down, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a longboard penchant.
There are hills here that would please them.
Prices seem actually high, but there are really people who put that kind of price on a bike, so "you see."
The tricycle of any terrain seems particularly useful to me.
Not all disabled people are poor, though.
Many of them have reasonable insurance at their disposal.
Only if they became disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know very well that they are needed for us.
We can't really say the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a draft, it's not planned to make it.
I'm CONTENT that the "long distance" wheelchair doesn't come into the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been trapped in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people under the age of 18.
The eight-year-olds have lived under Israeli blockade all their lives!
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation as well, since this blockade imposes a "collective penalty" on all civilians in Gaza.
" Entrepreneurs who work on their projects divert a little from their cement to the black market " ...
Ah, that's not wooden language, rather concrete and armed the lady...
References are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The right cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, it's certain, and it's recognized.
Two million human beings have been trapped in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The United States has a well-maintained land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded it!
Remember also that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israeli-Egyptian...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built on the contrary of the population that chose its masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought it through.
Couchsurfing is way cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the sharing economy, not for profit.
Many are only looking for a one-night ride on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping) in another way.
It's always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, owners and tenants who trust each other often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, thus bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this.
"What does she put for rent on"?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The word "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all the safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to engage in a commercial activity (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The penises are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it would always be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our penises...
Where are you gonna tie him up?
No Marine Le Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than the one that exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to stop!
High finance, speculation, plays with our companies so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our food so our food, with the structures of care so our health, with our debts therefore our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they hold..
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obeses of money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Minister of the Economy of Rothschild Bank, a history of better defending the interests of banksters, solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no other comparator?
What do you call this: return his jacket, lower his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
We don't really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure Spee really refused to help the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Speed quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cook in the area.
The sea was wet at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Malouines, where, on the photos showing the survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea and in broad daylight.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, that doesn't really correspond to what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two cooked cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after they had stopped firing, and a chase began.
The Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he approached, he saw that it was just a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joins the battle late and lives the Monmouth, bent and seriously damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his projectors at the ship's flag, the proposal to surrender was refused and he opened the fire, finally sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee considered that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 2215 hours.
Concerned about reports of a British cook in the vicinity, he headed north."
So, if that's true, the Germans, taunting in the darkness before the radar invention, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not look for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy cook in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they got lost to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should take a path through many ships of the Royal Navy.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several voices rise to the UMP to ask that the law should state that a permanently convicted elect be thus permanently ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch left-wing elected people of course.
But noon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSED AN INSTITUTION TO THE DEATH OF THE CONS OF MAGISTRATES
When is the trade union ban on the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always prompt to love those themselves who will benefit from their inviolability to hinder the actions of the real politicians, who really try to make things move, not the beautiful speakers whose immobilism is commensurate with their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their small banners" of the subs for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members place the enormous power they hold in the service of its party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing, or even right-wing, trade unions designated individuals on its side as targets and led to a legal-media war against them.
Your statements are totally free.
If, at the moment, the right forwards the judicial news it is simply that it has committed facts that are relevant to it !
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with Justice, but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not been treated favorably.
On the other hand, it must be remembered that the judiciary union, which is on the left, is not the only union of magistrates and that it is a minority.
That a minister supports with such commitment the unions show how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you quote may be minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at Chancellery, it is not a secret.
It is now questionable whether the "mission" of certain judges is no more dirty than instructing.
@ Gus - You should be satisfied, the MS is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that magistrates are not civil servants like others: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and incarcerate everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most hungry fool of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I'd be surprised if someone accepts their offer.
Many used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Direction fills the stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, has launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is part of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed with the Eurovision, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars on British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that's what happens anyway to most of the stars who don't take part in the competitions.
Few are those who, after a tube, manage to make others.
Anyway, most singers/groups can at best expect three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
His fame comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical path of rock, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitarists who smoke grass in their father's garage and swing three chords on a primary school level poem will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before they even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the studied peoples – a distance that turns quite quickly to racism, because the sacralistic ethnologists present these distant people as infinitely superstitious and petrified ritual moustache, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, of practical considerations on a daily basis.
Except you're misinterpreting it in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of a sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as recalled to see the sacred as a sort of object well defined and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article in any case.
It's ephemeral deco to furnish the void.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred life still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw at the otters not at all scientific interpretations that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When's a cross-examination of disciplines to make fun of?
Because what is true for archaeology is also true for the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and before archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Today we have such efficient technical and scientific means that the interpretation of excavations is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
One is there in full (and old) controversy about the shamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf his book "Les shamanes de la prehistory", especially the increased re-edition of scientific controversy, published at La Maison des Roches editions).
Thank you for this informative article
Heterosexual men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could get in there.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why can't we continue to three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play on this.
We couldn't watch a musical on that, though, that would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, may I suggest you move to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays for real, courageous journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their risks and perils.
Instead of getting rich with these little ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Go away then.
If these "baby ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and to publish an article on anal sex?
Is that the subject that strikes you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
Nevertheless we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Amateur crash video on the net...??
If the FOM chose not to show these images it is only to protect its interests under no circumstances those of the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the pilots it would have exited the safety because at the time another vehicle (e.g. troubleshooter) was entering the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it appropriate to advance the time of departure (television, pub, money...).
But apart from that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, I share that view, too.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at the restort to beat the English that led then...
You're leaving my dear Dayrton on this blog.
But it's okay, I've got a little time to pick up all your craps.
No, just no.
There have been lots of conspiracy in F1, but never one that puts commissioners in danger of death for a distant story of the possibility of victory of one pilot at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that gets out the safety because it's the FIA.
Size nuance.
In view of the amateur images, the lack of image allows the AIF to avoid the disturbing questions of the type: How does the Commissioner act a green flag in full intervention and continue to do so after the accident (see the complete video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the commissioners is clearly agitated a green flag, sign that the race can resume normally and that one is more under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a gloomy misconception of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under yellow flag regime AFTER the site of the accident, hence the agitated green flag.
It's the usual procedure.
The position of commissioners just downstream of the accident (as the case may be, it can be 10 meters as well as 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal look.
Sensationalism sells pubs.
Before I thought that the media were an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid, ultimately, it's just for money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of not having a sex life, the pub and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The information does exactly the same thing.
Buzzing with information that you really don't need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so you can keep controlling them.
"When the tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear" It should be "derailed," not "to cough".
Given the medical reference, "to cough" is much better said in this context than "to derail".
I wonder if all the people who are anxious that Ebola could begin to spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing too much honor to them.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism beautifully and solidly.
It made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media are talking about most things with this optimism backwards.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently scared and distressed (without getting to hysteria) for the government to get us out of the way when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we must undergo a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have a Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it itself has invented.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to still be from this world almost 35 years later.
Also at first it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of spending years...
Testimony perfectly useless.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only are the testimonies useless: taken in isolation, they cannot be used as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonies cannot be used as scientific material.
This may be why we refrain from asking patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric file mentions that my mother psychiatrist explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's an unimportant subjective testimony.
Ah, because attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
So, what do you base your research on, then?
On fantasies?
Do you have the same level of fantasy theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the word canadian flattered by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think of themselves as great psychologists after reading D'ansembourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of meaningless buzzwords in Psyches.
Cyrulnik has hit us with "resilience".
Since he is a great scientist, Cyrulik, I hope that he has given us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to get the Sentinels out of the air...
And why is that?
It was a great show and it looks like the ones who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang?
The only solution that comes to mind is the humor like pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a children's show.
The kids were hanging up.
Oh, because it's a children's show?
UKIP works for the Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if you don't see the sons and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although I am an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to rebroadcast the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it's been at least 40 years since we had one-hour episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 06:00.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and we can always see it at these times.
And besides the half-hour episodes now pass at 05:30, Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a 60-year-old sad guy, but I don't watch this show every day!
There is no "Mount of the temple" in or under the mosque of the esplanades!!!
Radical Zionists have invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations below and around the Esplanade Mosque for several decades have not been able to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if it exists it is elsewhere.
Maybe in Argentina??
This mountain is not wanted for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of mosques was built.
Its top, or dome of the Rock, rises in the middle of Omar's mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac there.
Since it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to remember it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the plan to two states, and tasted it continuously!).
It is also good to show how much the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Will God recognize his own?
The shortest Jewish joke: "God be praised!"
In order to boast about tourism in Israel, we are often shown half-dressed young naïves on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the picture that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a beautiful piece of propaganda!
It is a pity that the photographer of Reuters did not take pictures of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to trample the Jewish faithful underground, praying to the Wall for lamentations.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it is not the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology that she transmits that must be condemned.
This system is not tenable and will end in tears.
The only way to put an end to this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to be running out of business, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They managed to convince their employees that they are lucky enough to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given the little elite more and more pay at the top.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of grumbling and moaning when someone else strikes, support them, show some solidarity and understand that their strike not only concerns their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not being fucked up with impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case, it's tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you've forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like, for example, China and India.
All this can't end well.
It's because we're in democracy that it held.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TITP) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
It seems incredible, but that's exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people about the unimaginable damage that this agreement will have on our lives.
Only recently do we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement Look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat, and tears"?
This makes excellent spinoffs, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on trees.
The next weak link is likely to be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the 18th there were unions in all the regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Leave her (finally, her officers, the others, no one knows anything) to believe the safe of the eternal values of France, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even though it's getting more and more uncomfortable for her...
You still miss the union of your married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs, and I don't know what yet.
If you don't write the French correctly, I'll join.
You're being warned, it'll be your fault.
For the defence of class interests, the protected professions with trade unions are already suffering well enough, which has created a break in equality with other citizens.
It is requested not to laugh about fear of risk on the part of an employee.
We can very well imagine a system that guarantees a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, it's a disaster.
And with the carts preparing, the government welcomes them.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject commented here...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
He'll be like, "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in the management of enterprises".
This is absolutely essential with the disruption of information power.
And yet you have opened, probably read and then commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off review". ????
Wait, the section was there, empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I watched, and I can tell you that some of them have been seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's marriage we have one of the best moments (which was misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, pie mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the least worst baker; no one has done like "boom, here's my fucking cake now eat it and bow before your master"!
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and parents outside finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept out of the way.
And there's also this idea of "playing security, there's always next week" that disappears last week.
I like to cook, but I can't imagine doing that to myself.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us great entertainment and push us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them, and they had to do one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to leave, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis's, the only real defect they could find was the base a little dry (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that the green frosting on Richard's mill did not give rise, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time allotted.
There is also cancer that watches, with sunburns.
It's all a success right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field was weakening, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to "hunt" the ozone from the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less VU and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don't suspect.
If we limit ourselves to man they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat ourselves (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, apparently, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks cancerous UVCs and allows UVAs and most UVBs to pass.
Do you know that you are not obliged to be condescending and to consider your interlocutor to be a persistent when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor clarification that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to be pedagogical.
Not to mention that I'm used to melanoma, UVs only allow its development.
They're not trying to prove it.
For proof: not all bronzed people have melanomas.
Either, when a toubib tells you that you have to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it's better not to listen because UV is necessary for any human.
The excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we bend it?
And more importantly, can we pass it on to the mixer?
or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it and the robustness of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for the use to which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resilient and therefore has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as frontline communication equipment.
But for the rest of us,
That's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it.
Except for a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I've decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke on the fold I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and we don't see how it could return to it.
So, ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..........................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed properly and which is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of a FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah l article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrialists produce in » industrial' We highlight super u but all the brands and even the small trade are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 165€ (average wage in france)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After all, he is free to put his priorities where he hears it.
For my part, food is one.
Go without grudge, I kiss you
People who see the world through ideological "software" are called bobos, or rather boboecolos, which leads them to disconnect from reality.
It's total thought-raison unbundling.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example pretend to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in truffles, joining in this the left-cavian, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning the releases of CO2 while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and truffles, too, do not be surprised to meet often criticisms about them.
Wauh, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all related details (airplane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't be a part of it.
The concept is not so complicated.
Boboecolos are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of the left-cavian?
Well, you're able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in short-term ecolos.
Boboecolo is part of it but only represents the most visible fringe of the ecolos because it is the one that infests the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in the face.
She's so badly done that she looks vaguely like a female nude.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
One must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you just don't have any legitimacy to make a comment since you haven't spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin doesn't know how to draw and seems always obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by not having any artistic capacity.
That's art.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
That is not really a fact.
This is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate is realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke by playing pool.
Judging art may be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real.
If you're looking for this, a camera will do the trick.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak of itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still something to save: riding activities, the number of Republican guard horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
(Honesty obliges to say that France reduces its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes in a more drastic way, to begin with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operative without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, as we observe the weaknesses, shortcomings of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities or even part of their history.
Where's the promised sanctuation?
@edmond: That's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to make savings but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look where the gabegie is certain.
That all those who have swayed little or no military thing dare come to say here, eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting of laughter...
That the same potion is applied to the public service as a whole and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really loud: look at the inflation of public jobs in other departments and you'll understand why Defence may feel a little busy!
Well, yeah, the savings that everyone agrees to say they have to be done, it has to be seen somewhere, doesn't it?
Lack of pot, the ones on whom it falls groan at the murder when it comes to their homes, the poor darlings.
It would have to be done, but most of all it doesn't fall on me because, in this case, it's a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for local communities, history repeats itself at each closure of posts, maternity, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for the savings of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and doesn't rejoice at the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most horrifying thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three commentators make the same bad joke.
It's the depressing thing to show off his Facebook feed and see that 80% of his friends started their status with the phrase "This embarrassing moment."
I think they're gonna make a movie of it.
He'll probably rely on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus going to work and only realizes that his skirt is back in his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, in my opinion, the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and tighten his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of his return to the scene after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
I don't have a computer.
God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie has really just shown that he is at the top of the cosmic universe of satirical journalism!
I'm falling for it!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter that they finally have enlightenment and discover the incredible fulcurity and insurmountable genius that springs from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine light.
Oh, my God, that was really bad.
Especially if they're not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows positive developments within democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until further order we have confiscated the right to save our planet by states that play truffles at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take control of things.
With the commissioner they planted with energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew ....
Translate: Winds and solar farms are tomorrow's Round points.
All financed by the contribuable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the chain is not fully controlled, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided of course we drastically reduce our consumption.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is in no way concerned.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions at production and epsilon for other steps.
Electricity by renewable wind or PV is already more GHGs on the other steps and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittence.
Replacing nuclear power with wind or PV renewables would go against the fight against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am Doctor of State in physical sciences 1981 further I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the contrary of what I said.
For what I didn't say it was you who gave me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany in fact you didn't respond to what I was saying and as all right-wing people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I would also like to quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: the current renewable energy programme in Germany is a cost-effective and ineffective means of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you do not count uranium extraction and construction and if you do not count greenhouse gas water vapour less effect than the Co2 it is true that two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant starts in water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a "South Asian giant"...!!
The last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I'm not surprised, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had described India as South Asian giant...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are involved, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a box of Pandora full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening game was surprisingly interesting, the Kolkata Athletic imposing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
In comparison to the billions and billions that India devotes to the Cricket of the IPL and now to football, how could we one day compete with our "quiet neighbours"...
The low cost launcher race pays cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect only occurs with a helium that is too cold.
So maybe we're not in a lack of design, but implementation...
Unlike arianspace which is a private society, it seems that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay the satellites in frigates who knows.
This is all the more unfortunate as many media take over only the headlines of articles - and many readers only hold these headlines.
In total it creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Quite agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project while it is only a launcher problem.
