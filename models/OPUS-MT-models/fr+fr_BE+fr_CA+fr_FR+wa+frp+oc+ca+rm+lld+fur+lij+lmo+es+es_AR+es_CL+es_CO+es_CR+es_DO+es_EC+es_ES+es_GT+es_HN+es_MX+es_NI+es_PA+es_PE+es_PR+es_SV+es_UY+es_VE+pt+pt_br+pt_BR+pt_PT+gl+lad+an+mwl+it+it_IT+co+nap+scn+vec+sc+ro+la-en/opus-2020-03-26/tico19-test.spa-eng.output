Accrued rapidly increasing incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages according to the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly advancing in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a wave of patients with VOCID-19 who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China reported that the causing agent was a new coronavirus that is now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with VOCID-19 have mild illness, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most recovers.
In 14% of cases, VOCID-19 evolves towards a more severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalized with VOCID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined trends in the cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of VOCID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are now following that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of VOCID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020, in people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of VOCID-19 had been detected in the 30 EU/EEA and United Kingdom (UK) countries, according to which between 31 December 2019 and that date inclusive, there had been 39,768 cases and 1727 deaths, of which 17,750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy alone.
Obtaining the accumulated amount and cumulative incidence of cases of VOCID-19
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), reports of cases of COVID-19 reported in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with that of Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of VOCID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of cases of VOCID-19 truncated at 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of VOCID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK country, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the accumulated number of reported cases in each country as of March 15, 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared to Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries
Trends in the cumulative incidence of 14-day truncated VOCID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries, in general, followed that in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased considerably around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA and UK countries showed upward trends in the cumulative incidence of similar VOCID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of VOCID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK countries, compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that by 15 March at 8 a.m., another 15 EU/EEA and UK countries had already recorded a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of VOCID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends in the cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 suggest that the pandemic is advancing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is true despite the different stages in countries, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different country case definitions and different protocols to select patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of patients with VOCID-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of cases of VOCID-19 to a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data are not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care every 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios for the saturation of medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of cases of hospitalization by COVID-19 associated with a risk >90 % of overcapacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since, so far, clusters of cases have been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a defined regional collection population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the VOCID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with VOCID-19 who require medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC's rapid risk assessment, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give sufficient time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response in a timely manner if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures necessary to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in the death of 3000 people and has infected more than 80 000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the bat and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the research theme, which is rapidly developing.
We will address the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still have no answer, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Day of January 25, 2020 has become an unheard of and unforgivable memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home during the whole holiday and for several weeks more due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly throughout the country and to nearly 50 more countries worldwide.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of VOCID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3000 patients deceased.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on VOCID-19 have been published, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the isolated virus of multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to summarise the progress made in research on this new subject which is rapidly developing.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as some critical questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, which mainly cause about 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have found ourselves twice with highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, that is, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with appalling morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of VOCID-19 is the third by coronavirus that is recorded in the history of humanity.
As shown in fig. 1.1, conglomerates of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported for the first time on 31 December 2019 from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of health care providers was reported, suggesting that human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the source of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and nearly 50 more countries around the world (fig. (fig. 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed VOCID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men more (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 expanded into conglomerates mostly in Hubei and its surroundings.
On average, there were 5 days (from 2 to 9) between the onset and diagnosis of VOCID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, which coincides with the time of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Day in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86 %), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59 %).
The three main risk factors for VOCID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a large, wrapped subfamily of viruses that contain a single-way RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are those that infect humans.
Spy glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to its cell receptors, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released to the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, together with the glycoproteins of the envelope and the proteins of the nucleocapside, forms vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on January 10, 2020.
It was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original site of the outbreak: Wuhan Huanan seafood market.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 weaker than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 may have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the ORF8 does not contain any known domain or functional motive.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the full-length human ACE2 electronic cryomicroscopic structure in resolution 2.9 Å, in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug study in order to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and the intermediate guest
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the bat was considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is identical in 96 % to two coronaviruses similar to SARS of bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus to cross the barrier of species to infect humans, and the transmission route remains unclear.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of bat virus to humans, implying homologous recombination within protein S.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolines (long-deck mammals that feed on ants and that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a pangoline-discovered coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 % difference propagated by the totality of two genomes remains a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected to provide concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, a chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective at deactivating the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
To date, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Therefore, we can only use previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. (fig. 4).4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the innate immune system of the host through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll type receptors (TLRs), NOD type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I type receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophagic phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T-cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
Cooperating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defense cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit T-cell functions by inducing apoptosis of T-cells.
Humor immunity, which includes complements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction of the immune system locally generates a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multi-organic failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by cluster onset, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographics of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the effective quarantine time according to the most accurate incubation period; it is this way that asymptomatic infected people will be prevented from transmitting the virus to others.
As usual, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptom or other symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnoea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients evolved rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for early diagnosis.
A demographic study of late December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98 % for fever, 76 % for dry cough, 55 % for dyspnoea and 3 % for diarrhoea; 8 % of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than patients with VOCID-19 and in line with the greater lethality of the MERS compared to VOCID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25 %) and sore throat (13%-25 %) were shown to be the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was required in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality of VOCID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% in 8096 confirmed cases.
For the MERS, according to a demographic study of June 2012, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was high and increased to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than the latter two.
Therefore, it is much harder to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, such as a cruise.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks of the occurrence.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients discharged from the hospital may again contract the virus, an alarm signal that quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <4×109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <1×109/l, and elevated levels of aminotransferase aspartate in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and reactive protein C and erythrocytic sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a product of the degradation of the fibrin present in the blood, was high, and lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Anomalies are detected in thoracic X-rays in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral emerald glass shadows or opacities in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ADRS).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases surfactant level and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Consequently, the worst findings in chest X-rays are usually in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of the pneumocytes, the formation of a hyalin membrane and infiltration of lymphocytes into the interstitial, and multinucleated syncisal cells in the lungs of a patient who died because of the disease, which coincides with the pathology of a viral infection and of the ARDS, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through a chain reaction of reverse transcriptase polymerase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of VOCID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China began to be used on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a CRISPR-based SHERLOCK protocol for detecting SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre sample) using a graduated rod in less than one hour that does not require complex instruments.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if checked in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can mostly provide support care to patients with VOCID-19, while testing a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include treatments currently in use or potential with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use plasma from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the digestive system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory assistance is critical to relieve symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assistance (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique that is used to treat potentially fatal heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine storm is known to be the result of an overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals that are the main cause of the ARDS and multi-organic failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include modulation of T-cell-controlled immune response; blockage of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a cytokine signaling route 4 suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the other hand, they can cause serious side effects, specifically osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, prudent use of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses has been recommended for a short period of time for patients with critical COPID-19.
At the time of this analysis, the efficacy of no antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, the efficacy of remdesiver, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in an American patient with COVID-19, has been verified.
Remedesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, resuscisor also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other viruses with monocadenary RNA, such as MERS and SARS.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to carry out a couple of trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody generation
The extraction of blood from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not get the disease is not novel.
In fact, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in the blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Its symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this in order to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, possibly resulting in fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or seek effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects largely depend on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to MCT theories.
Most effective components remain unknown or inaccurate, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for VOCID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, it was determined that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective for the treatment of VOCID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with VOCID-19 were observed in several provinces in China that used MCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7 %), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used MCT in only about 30% of its patients with VOCID-19, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the quantity and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of Western medicine (MO) only with the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the time required to recover body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only.
Most strikingly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8% versus 39 %).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM are still waiting for more well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and determine the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of VOCID-19 are usually very afraid of highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantiners also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric morbiditys were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the outbreak of COVID-19, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with VOCID-19, suspicious people and people who are in contact with them, as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission of infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible guests, and often complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines to generate potent, long-term neutralising antibodies or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Vaccinations with live viruses attenuated in animal models for SARS have been evaluated.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these possible vaccines in older people and lethal stimulation models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection should still be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is probably because SARS was extinguished 17 years ago and no new cases have been registered since.
However, there are still sporadic cases and conglomerates of MERS in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As a new disease, VOCID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a forecast model for disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with VOCID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also correct for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in 30-65-year-olds and 47.7% of these patients were over 50 years old in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring more intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly greater than those not requiring them (meaning 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a predictor of the evolution of patients with VOCID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with VOCID-19 who require intensive care most likely suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with positive ACE2 cholangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of reactive C protein (PCR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible predictor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation between the PCR level and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict patient evolution.
These enzymes are intensely expressed in several organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when the tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for predicting clinical outcomes and complications of VOCID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the use of high doses of corticosteroids was widespread in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period of time in patients with VOCID-19.
Mental stress: As described above, during the outbreak of VOCID-19, many patients have experienced extraordinary stress, as they generally endured long quarantine periods and extreme uncertainty, and attended the death of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies carried out so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SARS.
In addition to being replicated in the lower airways, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicated efficiently in the upper airways and causes mild or no symptoms at the early stage of infection, as is the case with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients at an early stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which makes it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, while transmission was mostly not occurring at the early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of VOCID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Great efforts are currently being made in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of halting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowdown in the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will be completed by March and the downward phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and had left the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode similar to influenza.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been managed to control.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may be weakened in terms of infectivity and eventually extinguished or converted into a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is given below (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus was also detected in faeces, which poses a new possibility of faecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by infections in nosocomia, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even transients in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with N95 respirator (serial number 1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the liquid droplets of a potentially infected person from being transmitted through the air or adhere to the surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (the 1860 series number) can protect against the inhalation of small virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virions can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measure around 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, medical care providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (serial number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear custom-made insulation gowns in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also use protective faces or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
It is considered that three feet is a suitable distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused great alert in China for its experience with SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was only until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message highlighted the alarm of the public, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Day, and the critical moment to contain the disease at a minimum level in Wuhan was missed.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this harsh lesson and take decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious in making public announcements, since each word matters to citizens and can change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic at an early stage, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in the implementation of adapted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve the response system of society on a regular basis.
The outbreak of VOCID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has generated the reappearance sensation of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between VOCID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and severity and mortality are also greater in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than VOCID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with VOCID-19 transmit the virus although they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, which causes a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of VOCID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can give positive in the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given the rapid progress made in the research of COVID-19, several important issues remain to be resolved, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two coronaviruses of bats similar to SARS, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the original host virus, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the responses to number 1 and 2, it is not possible to slow the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can resurrect at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to the cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically while it is transmitted between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, extinct like SARS, or re-emerged periodically like flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these questions and to many others.
However, no matter what it costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have spurred the co-evolution of coronaviruses and their guests, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses were known to cause mild diseases, such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 put the coronaviruses in the spotlight again and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to their brother, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonoses and it would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses.
Most human coronaviruses originate in bats, where they are not pathogens.
Guests of intermediate reservoirs of some human coronaviruses are also known.
Identifying animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
Investigate interactions between coronavirus and animal guests could also shed important information on the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge about the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as on their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
Notably, we compare and contrast the different human coronaviruses from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current disease epidemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful guest changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of positive monocadenary RNA virus with envelope.
These viruses, which house the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, were called "coronavirus" due to their morphology, by the form of crown they have under an electronic microscope.
As for its structure, coronaviruses have un segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into replicate polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spiga (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of accessory proteins specific to each lineage are also coded by different lines of coronavirus.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alfacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the genus of betacoronaviruses contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
The phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes of most alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronavirus.
The other five betacoronaviruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as common cold or diarrhoea.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively higher number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in today's history and has infected more than 8000 people, with a crude lethality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a persistent epidemic on the Arabian peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was later called SARS-CoV-2, is the cause agent of the ongoing disease epidemic by 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3120 lives and has infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but have great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework to understand the natural history, the driving force and the factors of restriction of jump between species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and intermediate animal guests and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications for the prevention of future propagation.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that parenting viruses of human coronaviruses are not normally pathogens in their guests of natural reservoirs, but become pathogens after transmission between species to a new host.
We also examine the trend of evolution of human coronaviruses, where increased transmissibility usually leads to decreased pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analysed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of strain B814 of HCoV-229E from nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discoveries of human coronaviruses in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 cell lines of the lung.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of common cold, such as headache, sneezing, general discomfort and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and the subsequent serial passage into the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both the HCoV-229E and the HCoV-OC43 are distributed around the world and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a period of disease of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients had a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", caused the first pandemic caused by a well-documented human coronavirus in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus that was discovered.
The first SARS case dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 cases reported with 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the superpropagators, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the onset of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, general discomfort and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and difficulty in breathing as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function and elevated creatinine kinase are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30 % of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tube, liver and kidney, may also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be fatal, particularly in immunosuppressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-pit lung biopsy of a family member of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate human coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was found to be prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Coriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed around the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community-acquired bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four human coronaviruses acquired in the community have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown causes, as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and keep continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
The MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in the laboratory originate in the Middle East, cases have been reported imported with occasional contagion to close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS resemble those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MRS also developed acute renal failure, which so far only occurs with MRS among diseases caused by human coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed laboratory cases were registered, with a high lethality of 34.4%, making the MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses for humans known to be.
From mid to late December 2019, conglomerates of pneumonia patients were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of infection of the lower respiratory tract caused by SARS-CoV-2 an international public health emergency and, in addition, called the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude lethality of 3.4%.
Notably, lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fever, cough and dyspnoea.
Diarrhea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82 %, they are categorized in different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid worldwide spread.
By comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and duration of the course of the disease by human coronaviruses are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has features that are more frequently observed in coronavirus infections of humans acquired in the community, including the presentation of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, there is also a small subgroup of serious cases of VOCID-19 as with SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is a little smaller.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both the human coronaviruses acquired in the community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passes between humans, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
If the faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 fulfils an important function, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it should still be clarified in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, such as the coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable propagation after human passes, will influence the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
The four human coronaviruses acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Coronaviruses have been eliminated from humans that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that developed serious diseases by human coronaviruses.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract the host's restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people become infected, the greater the likelihood that it will be fully adapted to humans.
If properly adapted, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other measures to control the infection.
For many years, the four coronaviruses acquired in the community have been circulating in human populations and have caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and highly pathogenic MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to spread to susceptible human objectives, possibly through one or more intermediate guests and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible as the coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community, at least for the moment.
However, it is more pathogenic than human coronaviruses acquired in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without an animal host of reservoir or intermediate.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolving, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifiers of human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it houses a closely related ancestor who shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir guest houses a human coronavirus on a continuous and long-term basis.
In both cases, guests are naturally infected and are the natural guests of the human coronavirus or their parental virus.
However, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and perform the function of host amplifier by allowing the virus to be replicated transiently and then transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus can cause infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also be adapted to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reservoir guest.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had had contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent research on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to that of the general population.
Civets of masked palm trees (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were registered after killing all the civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that the civets of wild masked palm trees or unexploded farms to live animal markets were mostly negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that the civets of masked palm trees would only act as an intermediate amplifying host, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the chances of several species of small mammals also acting as intermediate hosts amplifiers of SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of them seem to be terminal guests of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent searches of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, known as Rhinolophus SARS-related CoV HKU3 bat (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese herring bats.
These bats are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat coronavirus share a nucleotide sequence homology of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats harbor emerging pathogens in humans.
Several coronaviruses similar to SARS (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
It was shown that WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of bats uses ACE2 of bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter cells.
Amazingly, serums from patients with convalescent SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, in general, it is believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
According to the phylogenetic analysis, the MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as the Bat CoV-HKU4 and Bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
The RNA polymerase sequences dependent on RNA of the phylogenetic MERS-CoV are closer to their counterparts of beta-coronavirus of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, a living MERS-CoV can't be found in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the Bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87 %.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate reservoir guest of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive in specifically MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies, as have camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
A living MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal drain of dromedaries, which further supports that camels act as bona fide reservoir guests of the MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus in camels infected for research with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels spread viruses not only by respiratory route, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of spreading bat viruses.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to transmission between humans or unknown transmission pathways involving unknown animal species hosting MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat coronavirus, RaTG13, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the immediate reservoir guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are in the future coronavirus of bats that are virtually identical.
Presumably, intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the wholesale seafood market of Huanan, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small endangered mammals, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also host ancestral betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new pangoline coronavirus share a nucleotide sequence homology of 85-92% with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with an identity of around 90% at nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two sublinens of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In striking contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology across the genome.
An earlier study in sick pangolines also reported the detection of viral contigos in lung samples, which result to be equally related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility of the pangolin being one of the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct origin in the pangoline of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangoline betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangoline betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolines and other mammals should still be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin, betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangoline beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counterproposal defends a recombination between pangoline betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animal.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is spread among betacoronaviruses.
No conclusion has yet been reached on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat coronavirus, while parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (coronavirus of the Apalaches Mountains) detected in a tricolor bat in North America had a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although it has also been suspected of the camels as intermediate guests.
For greater clarity, the knowledge of the animal origins of known human coronaviruses up to the time is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human coronavirus transmission events among species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed between species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of transmission between species of HCoV-229E is not known with such precision.
Choronavirus of bats closely related to HCoV-229E has been found.
Among them is an alphacoronavirus of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of bat virus to humans directly.
First, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alfacoronaviruses related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alfacoronaviruses caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alfacoronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas acquire the alphacoronavirus related to the HCoV-229E of humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising for bats to transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while bat alfacoronaviruses act as a genetic acquis of the HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, in particular in the case of the MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by later findings.
It is clear that bats contribute, with a profuse collection of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the great ability to fly are all favorable conditions that make bats the ideal "virus propagator".
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced into the dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have become an intermediate guest, to be a stable and natural reservoir guest.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Their sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal guest of the MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangoline beta-coronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolines.
They may be a terminal host of SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronaviruses, such as civetas in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for transmission between species of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through killing or coal mining.
Secondly, pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplifier guests in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through killing and consuming game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of antibodies in domestic and wild animals is required.
Thirdly, as mentioned earlier, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolines.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronaviruses to cross the barriers of species.
First, their relatively high rates of mutation in NRA replication.
Compared to other monocadenary RNA viruses, estimated coronavirus mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of coronavirus to new guests.
Coronaviruses have an exorribonuclease reading check, whose elimination results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even invisibility.
Interestingly, it is known that the resuscisivir nucleotide analogue suppresses the replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remixer is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, Coronavirus mutation rates are about a million times higher than those of your guests.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is to be hoped that it has already adapted to another guest close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Secondly, the long RNA genome of the coronviruses exerts additional plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombination and thus increases the likelihood of co-evolution between species, which leads to the emergence of new coronviruses when appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by unique copious open reading frames and the functions of the encoded proteins towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and frequently change templates during NRA replication through a single "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a guest who acts as a mixing vehicle, chain change often occurs during RNA transcription of the coronavirus.
Full-length RNA and highly homologous subgenomics could be recombined to generate new coronaviruses.
phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses, such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-hospital interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences interspecies transmission.
In the present, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed positive selection in transmission events between species.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolated strains of human and civet SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV is believed to experience rapid adaptation in different guests, in particular with mutations in the RBD of protein S.
In general, the RBD of protein S of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is strongly selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in fragment S1, which binds to human ACE2 and its correctors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize the ACE2 receptors of several animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing transmission between species of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from isolated strains of human viruses and civets in RBD and 4 of them are found in the reason for binding to the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The civeta SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the interaction of the spiga protein with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be fundamental for adapting the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30 % difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit implies that the affinity of binding of protein S with human ACE2 could have changed.
In fact, a study of electronic cryomicroscopy points to the 10 to 20 times greater affinity of this binding compared to that of human ACE2 and protein S of SARS-CoV.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other corrector may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, the HCoV-NL63 also joins the ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated silica acid in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, after transmission between species from their animal guests.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of transmission between species of human coronaviruses is also determined by other factors of dependency and restriction of the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and guests of natural reservoirs of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to transmission between species.
Human coronaviruses should usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors to ensure successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of host-virus interaction should still be identified and characterized.
An objective research of the complete genome of the dependency and restriction factors of the host for SARS-CoV-2 could be beneficial using advanced CRISPR technology.
New human coronaviruses appear: we start from scratch
The diversity of bat coronaviruses offers numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses act as the genetic acquis of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been considered important in human adaptation, since bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but divergent ORF8 proteins were determined to be coded.
An elimination of 29 nucleotides characteristic of SARS-CoV was found in isolated strains at the onset of the human epidemic.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes change of guests.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Recombinations locations were also identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV suffered recombination events between different lines, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses are recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting in the release of viruses from the selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an intact ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alfacoronavirus has a single nucleotide insertion, which causes a change of frame.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new human coronaviruses is also driven by the pressure of selection in its reservoir guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats with coronavirus were infected, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
Bats appear to be well adapted to anatomical and physiological coronaviruses.
For example, defects in activation of the proinflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the positive regulation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer inhibitor receptor and the low level of expression of class I molecules in the larger histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats could suppress the replication of the coronavirus and affect the reading check of exorribonuclease, which provides the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic crown virus strains could also evolve by recombinant, which would lead to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for adaptation to the host.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir guests, such as bats and camels.
They are strongly replicated without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers exist and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine storm, where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has dissociated from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy of dislinking immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon, at least at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammation in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of VOCID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV.
Although a bat-coronavirus has been found that shares a 95 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat-coronavirus that shares a 96 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civetas and other animals in the markets have been found to have viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate guests of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangoline beta-coronaviruses have been found to be significantly similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolines could act as one of the intermediate guests or that pangoline beta-coronaviruses could provide fragments of genes to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by man, either deliberately or by accident.
Coronaviruses have recovered from the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
Vast evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate guests.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing wet markets and killing civets in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolines should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several beta-coronavirus lines of pangolines closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals remains to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed by the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in China with wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks may appear.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in wild state.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are great chances that these zoonotic coronaviruses will evolve and recombine, which would lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on poor experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until the opportunity to propagate is presented.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, human contact opportunities with bats and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to move away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep humans away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolines, it will be interesting to analyze under what circumstances bats and pangolines could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, it must be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it's a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parental viruses are expected to be identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continuous research in this area will clarify the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of VOCID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for the "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advisory directive for the diagnosis and treatment of infection by the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and is a good reference to fight this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase on the basis of the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for "suspicious case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of VOCID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially known as the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) and the virus was called coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advisory guideline that was posted online at Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
He's attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that VOCID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing on the basis of the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnostic and Treatment of VOCID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guideline and is also a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support your important work and express our gratitude.
However, his work also needs updating according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of VOCID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspect case, it is necessary to combine any point of epidemiological background characteristics with two points of clinical manifestations to perform a thorough analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations must be fulfilled if there is no clear epidemiological background:
Epidemiological background: (1) history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with confirmed groups of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as the home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in COVID-19 infection images; (3) total white blood cell counts showing a normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at early onset.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspect case with some characteristic of pathogenic or serological tests as follows: (1) positive real-time polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to the recognized new coronaviruses; (3) positive result for specific IgM antibody and specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a specific IgG antibody change against negative to positive SARS-CoV-2, or titration increase ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood samples or airways was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogen detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological tests were added to the seventh edition.

In addition, there is increasing evidence to remind us that caution should be exercised with asymptomatic and atypical symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow diagram of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case", we recommend seeking and complying with the newer guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guideline in a timely manner to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the largest in one day
Bangladesh confirmed yesterday five new deaths due to COVID-19 in one day.
It's the largest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that were staying in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Anti-Corruption Commission of Bangladesh, who was attending the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Transport by Road and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for longer than originally planned, until this next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially begun on 26 March and was expected to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still permitted.
The first recorded cases of VOCID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, involving two men who returned from Italy and also one of their wives.
As of 19 March, these three had already recovered.
More than a million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronvirus.
The milestone took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea stated, on Thursday, that it was one of the few countries without Coronavirus infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases within 24 hours before 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronary virus infections.
Across the world, countries announced more stringent measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to receive their wages without going to work until 30 April.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the state of national emergency 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of La Meca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the curfew was only kept between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia Lower Sanitary Paper Limits by Transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their sanitary paper purchase limits to two and a transaction package at all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were published as messages on the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
Consumers were reportedly being supplied for fear of COVID-19 in the event that people had to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to a parcel per order.
These changes were introduced after the previous four transaction packages restriction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of March 8, reported that, with the application of the restriction of four packages, "many supermarkets still exhaust the product within one hour of delivery," and said that the demand "had no precedents," while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected."
Sales rose with a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles requested larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a special Wednesday offer planned in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local city council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
It anticipates an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the Wednesday special offer.
In a report at News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said supermarkets supply stocks every night.
He stressed that toilet paper is a bulky article, which causes a low amount of stock in numbers, and, when exhausted, leaves a wide empty space in shelves, which intensifys the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea of [that] if there was a plentiful amount of the article in the shelves, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could [buy themselves] and there were large quantities, it would probably minimize panic, said Russell Zimmerman by ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives to Crap said last Wednesday that stocks were exhausted.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, pointed out that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain the supply, according to the report at News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property vendors offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at the auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because buyers had free time on the long weekend of Labor Day.
The NT News Thursday edition, a Darwin printed diary, included an eight-page insert designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The supermarkets at first were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report of 3 March, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited Andres toilet paper purchases to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares pandemic VOCID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic the ongoing outbreak of VOCID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
While the word "pandemic" refers only to the magnitude of the spread of a disease, not to how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to encourage Governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO.
We are very concerned about both the alarming levels of propagation and gravity and the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic "has no precedent."
In statements published by CNN in February, he stated, "In addition to influenza, no other respiratory viruses have been traced from the onset to the continuous global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, and said, "We've never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."
"And we've never seen a pandemic before that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemic condition arose following the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Faci, said about the outbreak, "in conclusion, it will get worse."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of VOCID-19 worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing disease pandemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as a public health emergency of international importance on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of VOCID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and approximately 97,000 deaths as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
It was estimated that the case-by-case mortality rate is 4% in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04 % in Algeria to 0.08 % in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping away from other people and controlling and self-insulation of people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic caused serious global socio-economic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies exacerbated by panic-motivated purchases.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation on the virus was disseminated over the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and other areas with significant virus cases.
Due to reduced travel and closures in the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a group of cases of unknown pneumonia, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to Huanan's wholesale seafood market, so it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the coronaviruses of bats, pangoline coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person who knew of symptoms was sick on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections with the last group of the wet market.
Of the first group of cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were found to have a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that, a case dating back to 17 November 2019, of a 55-year-old person from Hubei province, could have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases, according to reports, decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had, for the first time, exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of uninformed cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As at 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those aged 19 and under accounted for 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases relate to the number of people who underwent VOCID-19 tests, and who obtained a positive result confirmed by official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country had carried out tests in more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to carry out tests in people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, until 23 January, an estimated 86% of VOCID-19 infections had not been detected in China, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79% of the reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the amounts of infections in Italy were considerably higher than reported cases.
The initial baseline reproductive number (R0) estimates for VOCID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that it could be 5.7.
Most people with VOCID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time elapsed from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, the most frequent being 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80% of deaths were for people over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official records of deaths from the VOCID-19 pandemic usually refer to deceased people who gave positive in the VOCID test, according to official protocols.
The number of actual deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher, as people who died may not be included without proof, for example, in their homes, in homes of the elderly, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official registration of deaths by COVID in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States admitted "We know that [the number of deaths reported] is a underestimation," a statement corroborated by the subcontext anecdotal reports in the United States. This underestimation is common in pandemics, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As at 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Generally, a number of indicators were used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to region and over time, and are influenced by the amount of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global proportion of deaths in cases is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths in cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the mortality rate per case, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed as having died due to a disease, and the mortality rate for infections, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died due to a disease.
These statistics do not have a specific deadline and consider a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the mortality rate for pandemic infections as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random tests for VOCID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on estimates of the mortality rate by case.
WHO states that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania indicated, "Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, usually stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease is left without available guests.
But at this point, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when that will happen."
China's main medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said that "it could end in June" if all countries can be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said SARS-CoV-2 "will be circulating, possibly for one or two years."
According to Neil Ferguson's study of Imperial College, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine (possibly 18 months or more) is available".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, as it is transmitted so easily, will disappear completely" and "could become a seasonal disease, which reappears every year."
The virulence of reappearance would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less frequent symptoms include fatigue, production of sputum in the respiratory tract (flem), loss of sense of smell, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptitis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pressure or persistent chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and bluened colour on the face or lips; in the face of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is recommended. The greater progression of the disease may cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory difficulty syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, not presenting clinical symptoms, although the test results confirm the infection, therefore the researchers advised carefully to control and examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected people in order to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44 %.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; more often it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with VOCID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease is spread are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact and through small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing or speaking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, when coughing without covering the mouth the droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated by speaking. Respiratory droplets may also occur during exhalation, even when speaking, although the virus is usually not transmitted by air.
Droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and therefore air propagation.
It can also spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then you touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through faeces, it is believed that this risk is low.
The Chinese Government denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may be possible before symptoms are manifested and in more advanced stages of the disease.
People achieved positive results in disease testing up to three days before symptoms appeared, indicating that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
There are only a few laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic case reports, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) maintains that, although it is not entirely clear how easily one person usually infects two or three others, the virus survives from hours to days on the surface.
Specifically, it was determined that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that may have touched infected people.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronaviruses related to nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies when in contact with soap, which dissolves its protective wrap. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (line B) along with two strains derived from the bat.
At the full genome level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of genome sequences between pangoline and human viruses.
To date, the complete genome comparison indicated that pangoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share a maximum of 92% of genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that pangolines are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although ultimately it is confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography images.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan comparing the polymerase chain reaction with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not using computed tomography as a detection method or as a front-line test to diagnose VOCID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done in blood or respiratory samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed with a nasopharyngeal hysop, although a throat hysop may also be used. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of these proved to be accurate enough to approve their widespread use.
In the US, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic features of the images of computed X-rays and tomography (CT) of symptomatic people include opacities in asymmetrically exposed glass and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an online international database of the results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, the unconfirmed image diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction has a limited specificity in the identification of VOCID-19.
A large study conducted in China compared the results of computed chest tomography with those of polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although imaging diagnosis is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a detection tool in areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect characteristics of the virus in images, both with X-rays and computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without washing them before, sneezing or coughing on a disposable handkerchief and throwing your handkerchief directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to prevent transmission; many Governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended that health care providers who care for someone who may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. Tracking contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has generated privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who gave positive in the VOCID-19 test. They are circulating misconceptions about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal washing and mouthwashing gargers are not effective.
There is no vaccine against VOCID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the bath or when they have their hands visibly dirty; before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes to contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with at least 60% alcohol in volume when water and soap are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without washing them before.
Surfaces may be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute after exposure to disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 % ethanol, 50–100 % isopropanol, 0.1 % sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 % hydrogen peroxide and 0,2–7.5 % iodine povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as an office or nursery, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs that have been used by sick people are disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with the flexed elbow or with a disposable to cough or sneeze handkerchief, and that they discard the handkerchief immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected wear surgical masks, as the use of a mask may limit the volume and distance travelled by the respiratory droplets that are dispersed when speaking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Using a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection without proper hand hygiene." The use of masks in people who care for someone who may have the disease has also been recommended.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they run a high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to promote the use of masks by the public.
In the US, CDCs recommend using non-medical masks made of fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or to be in crowded places.
Thailand's health officials recommend that people make fabric masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned exiting public spaces without wearing a mask or without covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people wear a mask while in public spaces to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government demanded the use of masks by all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured 10 million masks a day since mid-March, on 1 April demanded the use of masks by passengers on long-distance trains and buses.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to go outdoors, while it also recommends the manufacture of masks made at home to those who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) includes measures to control the infection designed to stop the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can implement methods of social distance by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using forms of greeting that do not include contact and physically distance from other people.
Many governments now require or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by government agencies and U.S. health organizations was reduced rapidly by 250 people (if there was no known spread of VOCID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and subsequently to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems are at increased risk of suffering from serious diseases and complications, and CDCs recommend that they stay in their homes as much as possible in the areas of the community affected by the outbreak. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social distance" with "physical distance", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, whether virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social distancing" has had as its impact the assumption that people should adopt complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations for only having sexual intercourse with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on adequate self-insulation; many governments have required or recommended the self-recommendation of entire populations in affected areas.
The strictest self-care instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to make self-care for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies to control an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is intended to identify and isolate infected persons, in addition to introducing other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are transferred to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme measures to be able to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive number to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk that health services will collapse and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of masks and self-care; physical distance-oriented community measures, such as closure of schools and cancellation of mass events; community commitment to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures and cleaning of surfaces. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the outbreak once its gravity became evident, for example, the implementation of quarantines in whole cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass detection assessments and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to those infected who decided to quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have great challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for health care by two thirds and deaths by half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Removal may be preferred, but it should be maintained for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this happens first), as otherwise, transmission is reactivated quickly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic entails social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for VOCID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing medicines.
Taking free-selling medicines for cold, drinking fluids and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of VOCID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional remedies" can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes capacity-building and the adaptation of medical care to the needs of patients with VOCID-19 as a key response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have developed guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on VOCID-19 testing, canceling optional procedures where possible, separating and insulating positive patients at VOCID-19 and increasing intensive care capabilities through training of staff and increasing the number of respirators and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case might have originated (the so-called zero patient).
The first case that was known of the new coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to Huanan's wholesale seafood market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus originates from one of these animals; or, in other words, it has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a number of cases of unknown cause pneumonia were observed of which Dr. Zhang Jixian was in charge at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported to Jianghan CDC in Wuhan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
The police admonished eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
At the beginning of January, sufficient cases of unknown pneumonia had been reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to migration for the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport centre and a major railway crossing.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
As of January 20, 2020, 6174 people had developed symptoms. As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases worldwide. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97 000 people have died and more than 364 000 have recovered.
Around 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as orders to stay at home, shelter orders in place or confinement) and curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, meet some kind of confinement in the United States, over 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 13 billion people are confined in India.
As at 26 March, 17 billion people worldwide were carrying out some kind of confinement, which increased to 26 billion people two days later, about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of unknown pneumonia, and her hospital reported to Jianghan CDC in Wuhan on 27 December.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
WHO was informed on the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police warned doctors in Wuhan to "broadcast rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission at first stated that there was no "clear evidence" of human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a drastic campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "popular war", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in the history of humanity", on January 23 a health cord was announced that prohibited trips inside and outside Wuhan, this extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected a total of some 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled (25 January) in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented more measures to contain the outbreak of the VOCID-19, which included the issuing of health claims for travellers and the extension of the Spring Day holiday.
Universities and schools throughout the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions implemented a number of measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement control has been implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that around 760 million people (more than half of the population) have faced some form of restrictions on outdoor exits. After the start of the global phase of the outbreak in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory quarantine of 14 days for all international travellers entering the city. As of 23 March, a case had only been transmitted at the national level in China during the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveller who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases transmitted at the national level was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, as well as in Wuhan, two months after the confinement was imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that the entry of visa holders or residence permits would be suspended from 28 March, without specific details of when this policy will be completed.
Those wishing to enter China should apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Government of China urged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic stimulus packages for signatures. The State Council declared a day of mourning that will begin with a three-minute national silence moment on 4 April at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the Central Government asked families to show their respect online to comply with physical distance in order to avoid the reopening of the COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that VOCID-19 spread from China to South Korea.
On 20 February, the country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, attributed mainly to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On February 22, of the 9336 church followers, 1261 or approximately 13% reported symptoms. On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the maximum alert level.
On 28 February, more than 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after the evidence confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
Airlines' schedules were also affected, and therefore changed. South Korea presented what was considered the world's most comprehensive and better organized program to test for the virus in the population and isolate infected people, as well as identifying and quarantine those who were in contact with them.
The detection methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by newly arrived people from other countries through a mobile application, drive-thru centres to perform virus detection tests with results available the following day and increased diagnostic capacity to test for up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantine in entire cities. South Korea's society at first was polarized with regard to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand the dismissal of Moon for what they considered to be a mismanagement of the outbreak by the Government, or to commend its response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases in a lower day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad must remain quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea received requests for assistance in virus testing from 121 different countries.
On 19 February, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
Early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports events and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran devoted five billion rials to fighting the virus.
On 26 February 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that people would only be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the New Persian year Nowruz continued.
The Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a post-China virus propagation center.
In the midst of statements of a cover-up of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than 10 countries had traced their cases to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament closed, and on 3 March 23 of its 290 members reported that they had achieved positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and also temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He indicated that there is a higher risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the largest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
As at 17 March, at least 12 ex-politicians or politicians operating in Iran had died of the disease.
As of March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to one WHO official, there may be five times as many cases in Iran as reported.
It is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran could be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded the alleviation of economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the outbreak to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists gave positive in the SARS-CoV-2 tests in Rome.
The cases began to increase rapidly, leading the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare the state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of non-related COVID-19 cases was detected, which began with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree to contain the outbreak, which included quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "You will not be allowed to enter or leave areas affected by the outbreak.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events in these areas has already been ordered."On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country while Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held in closed doors until April, but on 9 March all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the interruption of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Reanimation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations on the triage protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy surpassed China as the country with the highest number of Coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3405 pandemic deaths.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had dispatched nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, most of which occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that Italy's combination of a large elderly population and the inability to test all people with the virus to date could contribute to the high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any kind of social or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism for the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement that he did not recommend social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from their homes when possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced the early closure of all leisure establishments, such as bars and gyms, and promised to pay up to 80 % of workers' salaries up to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, which prohibited meetings of more than two people and restricted travel and outdoor activities to those considered strictly necessary.
Unlike the previous measures, the police could demand compliance with these restrictions through fines and dispersal of meetings.
Most companies were ordered to close, with the exception of those considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and workshops.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the main public health institute of the U.S. government, announced that they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start in conducting tests, which obscured the true magnitude of the outbreak at that time.
The conduct of the tests was hampered by the defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of approval by the federal government of the non-governmental test kits (from academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for individuals to qualify for a test until the beginning of March (a medical order was subsequently required).
As at 27 February, the Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been carried out in the United States.
As at 13 March, The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been carried out.

The general approval of Trump's crisis management has been polarized among partisan lines.
Some US officials and commentators criticized the U.S. dependence on the import of critical materials, including special medical supplies, from China.

Medical tests were carried out prior to take-off, and four South Africans with signs of coronary virus had to stay to mitigate the risk.
Only South Africans who gave negative evidence were repatriated.
The results of the test authorized all South Africans, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers who participated in the humanitarian mission, who, as a preventive measure, remained in observation and quarantine for a period of 14 days at The Ranch Resort.

On the other hand, China's aid was widely accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to control and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the SARS outbreak of 2002–2004, when the Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that prevented prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central Government "provided periodic updates to avoid panic at Lunar New Year's holidays".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that, while "definitely not a recommendation made by WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the place where it is most concentrated" and said that "it had no precedent in the history of public health." On 30 January, following confirmation of transmission between human beings outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance (SPII), the sixth since the first call for action during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that ESPII was "due to the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without sound health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On 5 February, WHO turned to the global community for a $675 million contribution to finance strategic preparedness in low-income countries, and cited the urgency of supporting those countries "who do not have systems to detect people who contracted the virus, if any".
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future." On February 11, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, had agreed to contribute the "power of the entire United Nations system in response".
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which enabled the coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will enable them to "focus on health response while other agencies can provide their expertise to address the broader social, economic and development implications of the outbreak".
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was activated to provide international and WHO field experts in China to assist in national management and assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with key institutions at the national level and to conduct site visits to assess the "impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including urban and rural environments." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronary virus pandemic", and noted that, although it was still very early to call it, countries should nevertheless be "at a preparatory stage".
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation there. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global threat assessment for coronavirus would rise from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement that "This is a reality check for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus can be on its way and we must be prepared," insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan also said that current data did not guarantee that public health officials declared a global pandemic, and noted that such a statement would mean that "basically we are accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "very concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and gravity and the alarming levels of inaction." WHO has received important criticisms of what is considered an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the request for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of all persons during the VOCID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts emphasized that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extreme poverty, persons detained, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the crisis by COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on political responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a country-by-country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response to the challenge of the coronavirus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several administrators at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) were fired because of their management of quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the response of the political system to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was taken to protect the secretary general of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from public anger over the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, rejected an earlier recognition of the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus," and stated that the "China censor overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic," which in turn was pointed out by some critics as racism and "distracted from the failure of its administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government describing a strategism of communications with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and citing the strategy as "Everything about China".
We have been told that we are trying to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy representative Josep Borrell warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and generosity policy."
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also requested that the United States lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to reports, it sent aid to the latter two countries.
On 3 April, United States sanctions blocked Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The US authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other countries to their own country.
There have been reports of mascara-related disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" which claimed that 80% of Russia's aid was "unusual or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of undertaking an offensive of "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, rejected the journalistic reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that "by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when US manufacturers of medical materials and equipment receive momentum, they will also be able to match if necessary."
NATO's planned military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, NATO's largest war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will take place on a small scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized Exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries participating, but also of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian Government was greatly affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of Parliament infected, as well as fifteen other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help, saying that his country is having difficulty fighting the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak prompted the demand for the United States to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts anticipated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government designated sites.
South Korea's society at first was polarized with regard to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand the dismissal of Moon so they considered the outbreak to be mismanagement by the Government, or to commend its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend Parliament and elections and sanction those who are considered to have disseminated false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
Several cases of supply shortages were blamed for the outbreak of coronavirus, as a result of the increased global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and disruptions in logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and the disruption of suppliers.
Several locations also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left the shelves empty of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, resulting in a shortage of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in e-mail shipments.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment increased 100 times.
This demand generated an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays of four to six months in the supply of medical items.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and WHO warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Daigo buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of VOCID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas were affected by the acute food shortage.
China and Italy's measures against the cumulation and illicit trade of essential products have been successful, and have avoided an acute food shortage anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could increase, according to representatives of the sector.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pigmeat reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws in Italy require food producers to maintain reserves for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a journalistic report of 16 March, China's economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the Government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20,5 %.
Since mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral outbreak has been considered a significant threat of destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could outweigh those of the SARS outbreak of 2002–2004.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of over $300 billion on the supply chains of the world that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was reportedly "returned" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to China's lower demand.
On 24 February, global securities markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of cases of VOCID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the outbreak of coronavirus, several U.S. stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average published their most pronounced falls since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with decreases of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH asserted China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions fell again on the basis of fears for the coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise company sector reached a level never before seen.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, an important travel season related to Chinese New Year's holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's festivals, while private companies also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events and tourist attractions of the Lunar New Year have been closed to avoid mass concentrations, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, the authorities extended the New Year's Day to 10 February, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80 % of GDP and 90 % of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to infectious disease to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected worldwide, with reductions in hours of care or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a 50-60% drop.
This also led to a 33% to 43% drop in pedestrian transit to shopping malls in March compared to February.
The operators of shopping centres around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in a situation of extreme poverty in Latin America than had remained in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the highest point of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were stranded in their homes in the interior provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government assistance.
The outbreak of coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate may reach 32%, according to estimates from the Bank of the Federal Reserve of San Luis. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of unemployed Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some kind of unemployment. Around 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit plan. Almost half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes subsidized by the Government, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German short-term work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which had an impact on the operations of organizations and on the people, both employed and independent, throughout the world.
Culture and arts organizations sought to carry out their mission (often funded by public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of its employees and the public, and support artists whenever possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, entertainment venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely worldwide and their exhibitions, events and shows were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence that increases at an accelerated rate of disease is the cancellation of religious services. Important sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian penitence season of Lent.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services through radio, live broadcast on the Internet or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with the empty St Peter's Square of Christian pilgrims, other religious agencies also cancelled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and then the sanctuaries were closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption in the world's sport calendar since World War II.
Most of the major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, the Euro 2020 UEFA, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak interrupted the plans of the 2020 Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event "will be rescheduled for a date beyond 2020 but not after the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gambling venues around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to resort to the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several music groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway, also suspended all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work through the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as live concerts broadcasts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet for artists to interpret, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous memes of the Internet were spread over the coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of eastern Chinese and Asian descent, and towards people in the areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (when most cases were still limited to China) have documented racist feelings in various groups around the world expressing that the Chinese deserved the virus or that they were receiving what they considered a fair reprisal.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiments.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese and those in areas affected by the virus have received support, both on and outside the Internet.
Following the advance of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens from countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea at first signed petitions for the ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was a trend on Twitter.
The Chinese, in addition to other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as assaults.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from northeastern India, who share a border with China, and who study in major Indian cities, suffered harassment in relation to the outbreak of coronavirus.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took revenge on them".
China's consulate in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said they were "wrong." In China, xenophobia and racism increased towards non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign rubbish" and destined for "waste."
Many pay-wall newspapers removed them for parts or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronavirus 2019 respiratory disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction test with reverse transcriptase, which detects RNA from the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibodies tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms that were too mild to inform or that were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited evidence, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population until March 2020.
As at 23 March, no country had conducted tests for more than 3% of its population, and there were large variations in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
This variability is also likely to be significantly affecting lethality rates for reported cases, which are likely to be highly overestimated in some countries.
Through the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be done in respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal hisopates or sputum samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours up to 2 days.
The polymerase chain reaction test with reverse transcriptase performed with pharyngeal hisopates is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people who are tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the airways by suction catheter, or the material that is expelled from the tosser (sputum).
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was conducted in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the chain reaction of clinical grade polymerase (PowerChek Coronavirus).
Search for the "E" gene shared by all betacoronaviruses and the specific RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China for a detection kit of SARS-CoV-2 based on polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their polymerase chain reaction diagnostic panel with real-time reverse transcriptase for the new 2019 (2019-nCoV) crown to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kits generated unconcluded results due to defective reagents, and an attack on the conduct of tests at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples were successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the tests using two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only then were State and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use authorization. US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at the national level of the tests for VOCID-19 based on the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase.
Similarly, on 9 March 2020, Quest Diagnostics provided evidence for COVID-19 at the national level.
No limits on quantity were announced; the collection of specimens and processing should be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the test for VOCID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Medical Care Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect infection with VOCID-19. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use permit for Abbott Laboratories for testing in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Holic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received the FDA's authorization for emergency use for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal amplification technology of nucleic acids instead of polymerase chain reaction.
As this does not require a series of temperature-altering cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are around 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test using a monoclonal antibody is being developed that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, hoping it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes as well as a rapid test for influenza.
As of March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that " chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT results [computerised tomography] can be obtained even before symptoms appear".
Typical CT features include bilateral multilobar opacities in exposed glass with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain develops, pattern in stonework and consolidation.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, where the chain reaction of polymerase was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the chain reaction of polymerase, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "do not use computed tomography as a detection method or as a front-line test to diagnose VOCID-19." Since March 2020, CDC recommends polymerase chain reaction as an initial test.
Part of the reaction of the immune system to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and population monitoring. Analyses can be performed in central laboratories or by testing at the point of care.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories may perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For analysis in central laboratories, a single specimen of peripheral blood is generally used, although serial specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For tests at the point of attention, a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by puncture into the skin.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, no extraction step is required prior to analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received approval from Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional chain reaction test of viral RNA polymerase.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. Early in April, the United Kingdom discovered that none of the antibody test kits it purchased were good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspected patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a specimen tube", the patient spits in the tube, sends it and gets a result soon. British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspicious cases in their homes, eliminating the risk that the patient will infect others if he goes to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if used. In the trials at the Drive-through Centers for the COVID-19 of suspicious cases, a health professional takes the samples with appropriate precautions.
The drive-through centres have helped South Korea to do some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of State Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment and that 10,700 people had been tested the previous week.
Health insurance assumes costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to do 160 000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, tests were offered using the drive-through system in several large cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, by the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of at least 483,295 samples had been analyzed, including the 12/2020 week, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) yielded positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion Institute and the Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for analyzing samples of 64 patients simultaneously, consisting of grouping the samples and only doing more analysis if the combined sample is positive. On February 5, 2020, in Wuhan, the BGI opened an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2000 square meters called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: │, or "Fire Eye" in English), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of the BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost to cope with quarantine would have doubled without this capacity for testing.
After Wuhan's laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow evaluating up to 1122 samples of patients for VOCID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid handling robots.
By March, the shortage and insufficient amounts of reagents affected mass testing in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve warming samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes to do more testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now doing more testing of coronovirus per person in its population than any other country, and was on its way to increase the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at Group 42 and BGI population level (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of polymerase chain reaction tests with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Different test formulas were developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for making kits that it sent to low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, which delayed the evidence available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on testing.
On the contrary, experts say that the high availability of South Korea tests helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private sector laboratories, over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization requested an increase in testing programmes as the best way to reduce the advance of the VOCID-19 pandemic. High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus resulted in delays in hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and supplies of hysopates and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to incorrect sample collection or incorrect use of the kits.
The Ministry of Spain said that it would remove the kits that yielded incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits to China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara, of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey purchased from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use". The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but, at the beginning of April 2020, announced that they were not needed.
The conduct of tests, complemented by the quarantine of those who achieved positive results and the identification of those with whom they had had contact who gave positive in SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place where the first death of COVID-19 occurred in Italy, carried out two rounds of tests in the entire population of around 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
Approximately half of the people who achieved positive results had no symptoms, and all the cases detected were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With intensive tracking of contacts, restrictions on travel from abroad, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore advanced much slower than in other developed countries, but did not apply extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28, Singapore began recommending residents to stay in their homes, but schools reopened in time after the March 23 holiday.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive tracking of contacts, restrictions on travel from abroad, testing and quarantines, but with less stringent confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have conducted more tests, in relation to the number of deaths, have lethality rates for much lower cases, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who have only mild symptoms or have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity for testing and have national laboratories with limited experience at COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive as % of evidence" is influenced by the country's policy for conducting evidence.
A country that only carries out tests in persons entering hospitals will have a higher number of positives as % of tests than a country that tests in all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing your hands in order to eliminate dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
The constant washing of hands with soap in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, e.g. diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via fecal-oral channels.
People can also get infected with respiratory diseases, such as common flu or cold, for example, if they don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If no water or soap is available, the hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing its hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After you ring your nose, cough or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hygiene of hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to remove from the hands pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause a disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that improvements in handwashing practices can lead to small improvements in the height growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate for these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce episodes of diarrhea by about a third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhea episodes can be related to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, such as automatic behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, an important acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and lives are charged for an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5 million infant deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bath into a deep habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce deaths by diarrhea to almost half and to one quarter deaths by acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Handwashing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of handwashing is that its frequent realization can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive handwashing can cause a skin condition that causes itching and makes the skin become squamous known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in healthcare workers.
Too frequent handwashing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce oral-facial transmission of diseases: after using the bath (ory, defecate), after cleaning the tail of a child (change diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
Other occasions where a proper handwashing technique should be practiced to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or ringing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of handwashing with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries conducted in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced handwashing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 per cent; the United States was close to half with 77 per cent; and China had the lowest rate at 23 per cent. Currently, there are several methodologies for behavioural change, to increase the habit of handwashing with soap at critical times. Group handwashing of children at school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate handwashing into children's behavior.
The "essential health care programme" implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of tailor-made action to promote children's health and education.
Disparate twice a year, besides washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin improves by adding soap or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective in cleaning the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved in water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of contaminated solid soap bacteria concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as bacteria rinse with foam.
Still, CDC states that "liquid soap with dispensation controls that do not involve using hands is preferable."
Antibacterial soaps have been promoted intensely for a health-conscious audience.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that using the recommended disinfectants or antiseptic agents preserve antibiotic-resistant organisms by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic-resistant strains, they may not be as effective as they are promoted.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protecting agent, sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more conditioning for the skin (aloe vera, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps for the consumer that contain triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
The nice hot water to wash your hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to remove natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using lukewarm water has no effect on the reduction of microbial load in hands.
A hand disinfectant or hand antiseptic is a water-free agent for hand hygiene.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the twenty-first century, the agents for the hygiene of hands without water and with alcohol to rub (also known as a solution for alcohol-based hands to rub, antiseptic solution for hands to rub or disinfectants for hands) began to acquire popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the effect of alcohol dryness.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing between 60 and 95 % alcohol at least eliminate germs effectively.
Alcohol-based smear disinfectants eliminate bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol disinfectants containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97 % (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99 % to 99.999 % (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand disinfectants are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Enough antiseptic or alcohol-based hand solution should be used to rub, such as to wet or cover both hands completely.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dried.
The tips of the fingers should also be washed well, rubbing them in both palms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States recommend handwashing before hand disinfectants to rub, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and the rapid removal of microorganisms; however, they should not be used as replacement for proper handwashing unless water or soap are not available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants may dry the skin, unless emollients or moisturizers are added to the formula for the skin.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing emollients caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Contact allergic dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or additives present in alcohol-based hand solutions for rubbing are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause contact irritating dermatitis was attractive compared to handwashing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove organic matter from their hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand disinfectants depends to a large extent on the ingredients and the formula, in addition, historically, has been much less than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions to rub.
More recently, formulas using benzalconium chloride have been found to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and instead use ashes or land.
Ashes or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the earth or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Moisten your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because containers with stagnant water may be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to make no difference.
Rub your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people usually wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Restrict for at least 20 seconds.
Restricting creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and restricting for longer periods eliminates more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Rinse in a container can recontaminate your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or leave to dry in the air.
The wet and wet hands become more easily contaminated again. The parts that are most often forgotten are thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can house microorganisms.
Wetting lotion is often recommended to prevent the hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
Several economic options can be used to facilitate handwashing when no running water or soap is available, for example, to pour water from a hanging can or pumpkin with appropriate holes or to use ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "home flue" and other economic options.
A homemade faucet is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended jar of a rope and a lever driven with the foot to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a bar soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective way of drying in public bathrooms.
More and more research indicates that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, Westminster University, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper towels industry association, to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and more modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased, on average, by 194 % in the yolks of the fingers and 254 % in the palms.
Drying with the air jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria by 42 % in the fingertips and 15 % in the palms.
After washing and drying their hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76 % in the yolks of the fingers and 77 % in the palms. Scientists also carried out tests to determine whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination of other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds, it is said, of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow the microorganisms from the hands and the unit and, potentially, contaminate other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the bacteria count after hand drying:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared with drying with paper towels.
Washing your hands with hand sanitizing wipes is an alternative during travel, when you don't have water or soap.
The alcohol-based hand disinfectant must contain at least 60 % alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its efficacy (in 1846) for disease prevention in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff members to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
The washing of the doctors' hands is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and strip all parts of the hands.
Hands should be narrowed together by intertwining fingers.
If there are remains under your fingernails, you can use a pig brush to remove them.
Since germs can remain in the water in their hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, use the paper towel to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from recontaminating on those surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in the health care environment is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of handwashing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
A study showed that proper handwashing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a sheet demonstrating handwashing and standard hand rubbing in the health care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization's hand hygiene guide can also be found on your website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if proof of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five moments" for handwashing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before aseptic work and
after caring for patients. The addition of antiseptic chemicals in soap (e.g., "medical" or "antibacterial" soaps) gives you the possibility of removing the handwashing agent.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To wash your hands before a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized brush to rub and another sterile instrument to clean under your nails.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow, generally, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsed, the water in the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands dry with a sterilized cloth and a surgical gown is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after caring for sick people.
To control infections caused by staphylococcus in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of washing and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases more than 35%.
Wash with common soap results in more than three times the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to wash with antibacterial soap. When comparing handwashing with an alcohol-based solution with handwashing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that alcohol rubbing reduced the contamination of bacteria by 26 % more than antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective at reducing influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium spores difficult to hand than alcohol-based hand disinfectants. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centers may include training staff on handwashing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand disinfectant and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are the most effective in the different health care environments.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered to be an economic and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good food.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or hand-washing facilities in households, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand-washing behaviour.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few faucets to wash your hands near public or private toilets, although there are economic options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low handwashing rates may also be the result of deep habits and not the lack of soap or water.
The promotion of handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to a change of behaviour in the long-term population.
For this to work effectively, follow-up and evaluation is necessary.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in PMRPs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting handwashing in schools is the UNICEF "Three Stars" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the campaigns to promote hand-washing that are being carried out to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness campaign that seeks to achieve a change of behaviour. As a result of the 2019-2020 crown virus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the creation of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of handwashing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting hand-washing with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant smells called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health-care-related infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the VOCID-19 pandemic in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters were hung with "right techniques to wash their hands" next to the washbasins of the public bathrooms and the bathrooms of the office buildings and airports.
The phrase "washing your hands" is a statement that you do not want to take care of something or share the complicity of something.
It has its origin in Matthew's biblical passage in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a much broader phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which represented her conscience of guilt about the crimes she had committed and which had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after remembering or reflecting on non-ethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value the elements for handwashing.
Moreover, those who have allowed to wash their hands after such reflection, are less likely to get involved in other "cleaning" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend handwashing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual handwashing in many religions, such as Baha'ism, Hinduism, Tevila and Netilate Yadayim in Judaism, the washroom in Christianity and Wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend handwashing, particularly after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force their hands to wash after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam force their hands to wash before and after every meal.
Risk controls at the workplace in front of COVID-19
Risk controls at the workplace with COVID-19 refer to the application of occupational health and safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and the job and are based on a risk assessment of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be prone to contract COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), work at lower risk of exposure has minimal work contact with the public and co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including handwashing, the recommendation for workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene standards and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Work at risk of medium exposure includes work requiring frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19, but who may be infected by the existing Community transmission or by an international journey.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and individual protective equipment available in case of a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care and funeral workers, exposed to people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, are at high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these people.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and individual protective equipment suitable for work.
The outbreaks of VOCID-19 can have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may fail to work by becoming ill, by having to take care of others or by fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are claimed and in terms of the means of acquiring such goods (such as buying in hours that are not high, by means of home delivery services or by car window).
Finally, shipments of items from geographical areas seriously affected by VOCID-19 could be interrupted, and a plan for preparing and responding to infectious diseases could be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls necessary to address these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the response to an outbreak include reducing transmission among staff members, protecting people at greatest risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used framework for occupational health and safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of VOCID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, individual protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve insulating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to workers' behaviour and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected according to the hazard to the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g., respirators), used appropriately and systematically, frequently reviewed, maintained, replaced if necessary and disposed of, cleaned and stored or disposed of correctly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), work at lower risk of exposure has minimal work contact with the public and colleagues.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent handwashing, recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene rules including covering coughing and sneezing, provision of paper and containers for waste, preparation for telework or staggered shifts if necessary, deter workers from using other tools and equipment, and maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay in their homes until they stop having a fever, signs of fever and any other symptom for at least 24 hours without taking medication to relieve symptoms or decrease fever; that sick leave policies be flexible and empower employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, work at risk of medium exposure includes those requiring frequent or close contact at less than six feet (1.8 m) with persons who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the community transmission of the moment around the location of the company, or because the person made an international trip recently to a place with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail environments. Engineering controls for this group and the highest risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, physical barriers such as transparent plastic blankets, and the placement of a window for the care service so that the customer can request from the car. Administrative controls for this group and the highest risk groups include recommending sick workers who stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, setting up staggered shifts, suspending travel that is not essential to the places with current outbreaks of VOCID-19, developing emergency communications plans that include a forum to respond to workers' concerns, offering training and training updates to workers on risk factors and prevention behaviours in relation to VOCID-19, training workers who have to use the industry as a means of providing protection and/or frequent equipment to use a protective environment.
Workers in this risk group should rarely use respirators.
If a person gets sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to assist the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper cloths when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable surgical gloves to care for a sick passenger or to touch body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, perhaps, individual protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruises and other passenger vessels, risk controls include delaying the journey by disease, self-insulation and informing the medical centre on board immediately if someone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the case of schools and childcare centres, CDCs recommend short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as canceling excursions, assemblies and other mass meetings, such as physical or choir education classes or meals in the dining room, increasing the space between the desks, staggering entry and departure times, limiting visits that are not essential and using a separate place for children with flu symptoms.
When there is considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, it may be considered to extend the cancellation of classes. For police personnel who perform routine daily activities, CDCs consider that the immediate risk to health is low.
Police officers are advised to contact persons who have a confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of VOCID-19 to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers must clean and disinfect their work belt and equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning towel before using them again and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that certain health and morgue workers are in high or very high risk categories of exposure.
Among the work of high risk of exposure are those of workers of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspicions of VOCID-19.
These become very high-risk exposure work if workers perform aerosol production procedures in patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of VOCID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples from these patients.
Some aerosol production procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure morgue work includes those in which workers are involved in the preparation of the bodies of individuals who had VOCID-19 or who were suspected of having it at the time of death; they become at a very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of VOCID-19, even when aerosol generating procedures are performed.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure can be appropriate in some medical care environments and morgues.
Samples should be handled by taking Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering should be separated into different waiting rooms depending on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those working at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients who have been infected or suspected of having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who perform aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators with a NIOSH approved filter mask or higher should be used in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program that includes adjustment tests, trainings and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, as VOCID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients entering.
For those who take respiratory samples of patients with VOCID-19, pay attention or transport them without performing aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, glasses or facial protectors, robes and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the provision of personal protective equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting the admission permit to a patient's room with VOCID-19 only to those involved in their direct care, using the same mask without removing it while paying attention to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protective equipment and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic people.

MATTER: [Covid-19] Lighten the load and prepare us for the future
DATE/SENDING TIME: 14 March 2020, 00:24 a.m., coordinated universal time
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
This month, we are in unique circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges it presents have no precedent, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community building that form the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern we have seen among all our colleagues in emails, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible are the people with whom we are lucky to work.
I couldn't feel any greater gratitude and pride for all of you being my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation he felt for our work.
I was reminded how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether it is by keeping the sites in operation, helping our partners receive their payment or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but how we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in it, starting next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and timetables
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to talk about our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be very useful for the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place today, and whether you have to care for your loved ones, shop or go to your doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
Although I shouldn't have to say it, we say it.
There is no need to apply for sick leave or paid time off; just inform your manager and help your team review schedules and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, notify Bryan, T&C Operations, so that T&C can help with the support and make sure the management is aware of your situation).
People who work per hour will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our hourly contractors and fellow staff.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are ill and cannot work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it's about your personal care.
What we ask you to do is get in touch with your manager so that we know what to expect and we can adapt properly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things we should continue to do.
The Site Reliability Engineering, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Security and Fundraising teams, among others, carry out critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and change our approach in order to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Reducing speed today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We don't plan to "duplicate the hours to catch up" when the pandemic is over.
It will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and will work to establish new objectives and deadlines when appropriate.
What about the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Planning.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allocates more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and caring for loved ones as we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reduced schedule over the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces current planning burdens and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and we will communicate the next steps to the delegates and the teams as soon as we have a confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
Status, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco's office might have been exposed to the virus from COVID-19.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and lifts that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own care protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our New York City partners already know, we've also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing, but they may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who had been working remotely since before know that this modality requires adaptation, so they offer the following suggestions:
Limits the duration of meetings at intervals of not more than one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to section them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting with a list of topics and send the reading materials in advance.
Adopt video usage by default, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Designate a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls questions in the chat and the list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email message to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use well-being refund for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distributed work
The Operations team of RR. HH. is analyzing the guidelines on ergonomics based on web seminars to support the increase of the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This past week we asked all beneficiaries of community grants to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the edits, until the WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We inform them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible to comply with their share of the activities agreed upon for the grant and that there would be no sanction for having to delay or modify those objectives.
Next week we will follow up with additional guidelines in Wikimania and other thematic community and regional conferences.
The overall feeling of the community at the global level seems to be, in part, sadness over the interruption and, in part, relief from the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
In future, CRT will be working to set up a page in Meta-Wiki in order to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintaining contact with respect to COVID-19 matters
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 h, universal time coordinated/07:00 h, Pacific time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We're together in this and we're available to help the way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information of this email and all additional essential information related to COVID-19 on Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are being significantly affected today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, some coverage problem or anything you may need help with, don't hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when necessary.
If you have sensitive or confidential matters, send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, Director of International Global Operations at HR.
None of these changes should be considered a abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are a recognition that, at this time, our work and our obligations should probably be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures that we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service it trusts.
Our planned work will remain there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need you to take care of yourselves and look after your families so that you can find yourself in the best possible condition when the need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) is an enzyme that adheres to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as a point of entry to cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is usually called hECA2.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metaloenzyme that contains zinc and is found on the surface of endothelial cells and other types.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a C-terminal domain of renal transporter of colectrine amino acids.
ECA2 is a single-pass membrane protein of type I, with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of the lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is split from the transmembranal domain by another enzyme known as shedase and, as a result, soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted through urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly attached to the cellular membrane of the type II alveolar cells of the lungs, to the small intestine enterocytes, to the arterial and endothelial venous cells and to the arterial cells of the smooth muscle of most organs.
The mARN expression of ACE2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striated body, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ECA2 is to counter ECA.
ACE releases the hormone of angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 releases the amino acid carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to form vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 can also split several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinin, appelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A and gredin.
ECA2 also regulates the traffic of membranes of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembranal protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 spic protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the host's TMPRSS2 protease serum, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a possible therapy. This has led to certain hypotheses that reducing levels of ACE2 in cells could help fight infection.
However, several professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard ACE and BRA inhibitor therapy .
A systematic meta-analysis review published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received treatment with ACE inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not so strong for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The mean life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the course of the 24-hour effect (duration).
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 may be a promising medicine for people with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is elevated. RhECA2 infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The applications of COVID-19 are mobile device software applications designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who might have been in contact with a infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular, in relation to systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to admit these Bluetooth-based apps directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source application and will be handed over to the government. In North Macedonia, "StopKorona!" was launched, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracking application was in an advanced stage of development and that it would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. It is planned to use a similar application in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol from Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetric application for patients living in Moscow who have received a diagnosis of VOCID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Safety Engineering at Cambridge University, exposed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the possible lack of effectiveness if the adoption of the application is limited only to a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add Coronavirus-related applications in its App Store to "official" or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through Coronavirus applications and, in particular, about whether the infrastructure created to deal with the Coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations submitted a communiqué demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
monitoring and monitoring expansions would have to have extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to objectives related to VOCID-19;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of this protection;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any data exchange with third parties should be defined in law;
Protections against abuse should be implemented and citizens' rights established to respond to such abuse;
The significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be mandatory. Germany's Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating systems when no longer required.
In some countries, network-based location tracking was used instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data present significant potential privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see below).
In South Korea, a system was used that is not based on an application to carry out contact tracking.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined it to generate warnings through text messages for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, something that is allowed due to far-reaching changes to information privacy laws after the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been published.
The tracking of contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a large amount of published research dating back at least to 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Low-Energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCNs, formerly known as contact event numbers, CENs) and protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking for privacy protection (PACTs), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never exit the device and all matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of techniques that protect privacy by collecting and using route location or intersection data to track the spread of VOCID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Applications out of control: how to maintain personal privacy during an epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of such data.
On 5 April 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly coincident protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, a key aspect for achieving broad adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol code used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative for tracking contacts that they said would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address adoption and persistent surveillance problems by first distributing the system through operating system updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Reperfilation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research that currently seeks to develop safe and effective treatments for VOCID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a vaccine against VOCID-19 and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites with ligand.
The analysis of these binding sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against VOCID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are protease similar to papain, RNA polymerase directed by RNA, helicase, protein S and ribofosfatase ADP.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest that then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the New York State trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate through an emergency use authorization (U.S.).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under a U.S. only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
CDCs said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when "there's no other choice."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Faculty of Medicine of Langone is conducting a study on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to demonstrate that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen reported negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration about buying the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who try to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by joining the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that joins the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, criticism has emerged about the allocation of resources to readaptation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international solidarity trial.
The remorse was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that the remorse had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple phyloviruses, pneumoviruses, paramixoviruses and coronoviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in a more serious disease and transmission.
Some initial pre-test studies suggest that resuscisors may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by hospitals at Cleveland University; one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more severe disease.
Three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials are under way for hospitalized and severely affected by VOCID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials with azithromycin antibiotic on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Alvesco (cyclosonide) from Teijin, an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as a treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a Phase II trial is ongoing and 200 serious patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of VOCID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6000 adults aged 40 years and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women, who breastfeed or who do not have an affective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On 14 April, a multicentre study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying great attention to the readaptation of antiviral drugs that developed for previous outbreaks of the SROM, SARG and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for treatment of VOCID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for treatment of VOCID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that were identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks IL-6 receptor): approved by China.

b'A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop this vaccine.
By the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the virus causing the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread throughout the world in 2020, triggering considerable investment and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against VOCID-19.
Among the targets of the main platforms that went to Phase I security studies are the following:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 possible vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (presumed to be planned or developed).
A Phase I or Phase II trial performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually random, placebo-controlled and multi-site, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while controlling the adverse effects that occur with the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (followed in the "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, Queensland University announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecularly subjected vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan's International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects human testing to begin in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in China on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with her biotech partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergency BioSolutions announced a manufacturing association with Vaxart for vaccine development.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with similar technology as it is used in the treatment of cancer-related neo-antigenic vaccines.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that the vaccine synthesis had been completed and that the tests were beginning.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that a project was beginning to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced they were working on a vaccine.
About March 10, 2020, Emerging Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working with 11 isolated individuals and that, although it is moving fast, it would take at least one and a half years to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The possible vaccine is at the laboratory research stage and testing in humans is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'large amounts of money for exclusive access to a vaccine against COVID-19", to which the German government complained.
On March 17, 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced an association with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an RNA-based vaccine.
The possible BNT162 RNA-based vaccine is currently in preclinical testing and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and that the human tests of the possible final vaccine could begin in autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a research alliance of a vaccine against VOCID-19 that includes the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, leading to the total investment of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against VOCID-19 to $29 million.
The other CEPI partners for the development of a vaccine against VOCID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began testing animals for six possible vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College of London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-replicating RNA vaccine against VOCID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the Chinese sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter VOCID-19, including a large number of potential vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the initiatives of Medico and the University of Saskatchewan.
More or less at the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another outbreak of coronavirus occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Faculty of Medicine announced the PittCoVac tests, a possible vaccine against VOCID-19, in mice and said that "the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines administered by MNA obtained powerful responses from antigen-specific antibodies (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal sprayer.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designated to replicate within the human bacteria and produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, the industrial sector and three US universities gathered resources to access IBM's supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
Vaccines that are developing may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of VOCID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed in ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, highlights the need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses and with international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SRAG and SROM vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SARAG that has proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARG was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. Nor is there a confirmed vaccine against SROM.
When the SROM was generalized, it was believed that existing research on SARG could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one vaccine against SROM (based on DNA) completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, three were ongoing, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenovir vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one VMA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory according to which the causing virus of COVID-19 was known and already had a vaccine.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as the SARG coronavirus.
b'Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the coronovirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organic insufficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153 000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread among people during close contact, usually by droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets are produced by exhaling, they usually fall to the floor or on the surfaces, rather than being contagious in long distances.
People can also get infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although propagation is also possible before symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease. The standard method for diagnosis is the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcription (RTR-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hisopate.
The use of masks is recommended for those suspected of having the virus and its caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend that they not be used, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against VOCID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have symptoms similar to those of the flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and face or blue lips. If these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper airways, such as sneezing, nasal dripping and throat pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in variable percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented chest oppression and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multi-organic insufficiency and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of VOCID-19 is usually from five to six days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. Not all infected people are reported to have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can help spread the disease.
The proportion of people infected with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections of that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was conducted.
Both sputum and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speak loudly releases more droplets than when spoken with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering the mouth when coughing can cause droplets to travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission by biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the hallway outside people's bedrooms gave positive in viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, consequently, air transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of spread through stools, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although it is not entirely clear how easy it is to spread, a person usually infects two or three more people. The virus survives hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in the carton, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99 % copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used in the right way. Soap products degrade the virus's protective lipid layer and deactivate it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken at an average of two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of the test.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronaviruses of related nature.
Outside the human body, domestic soap kills the virus, as it returns its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by VOCID-19, because the virus enters the host cells through the angiotensin I Type 2 converting enzyme (ECA2), which abounds most in the lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special superficial glycoprotein called "spicle" (peplomer) to connect to the ACE2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, an acute heart injury was identified, which is most common in severe disease.
Cardiovascular symptoms rates are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute myocardial injury may be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and participate in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in patients in the ICU with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to poor prognosis. In the autopsy of people who died from COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes were detected in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism over epithelial cells expressing ACE2 of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that secretive T-lymphocytes of GM-CSF pathogens correlate with the recruitment of secretory IL-6 monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In the autopsy, lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done in samples of the respiratory tract obtained by a nasopharyngeal hisopate; however, samples of nasal or sputum hisopates may also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with two weeks of difference and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the crown virus strain and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories in the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were being developed, but were not widely used.
The experience in China with the tests has shown that the accuracy is only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular emerylated glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in the initial stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain may appear, pattern in disorderly padding (lobulillar septal fertilizer with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation.
Few data on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19 are available.
The main pathological results of the autopsy are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocytes hyperplasia, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ADRS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in curation: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (IDC); leucoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing your hands with water and soap often for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
CDCs recommend covering their mouth and nose with a coughing or sneezing handkerchief and, if they do not have handkerchiefs, use the inner part of the elbow.
Appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of fabric covers in public places, one of the reasons is to limit transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distance strategies seek to reduce contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling crowd meetings.
Distance patterns also indicate that people should maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, as soon as possible, a key part to control COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "planning the curve".
CDCs also recommend washing their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when the hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after ringing the nose, coughing or sneezing.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when there is no water and soap available in a timely manner. For areas where hand disinfectants are not easy to obtain, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are given supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
CDCs recommend that those suspected of having the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxygenation (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Supportive treatments may be useful for those with mild symptoms at the initial stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with VOCID-19.
Intensivists and pneumologists in the U.S. compiled the recommendations of several agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for VOCID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paretamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen.
Caution should be exercised to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in health care environments when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
CDCs recommend that health care professionals take care of people with VOCID-19 to place the patient in an air infection isolation zone (AIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to avoid air transmission. CDCs highlight guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPS) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipments are PPE coats, masks, protective glasses and medical gloves. When available, the respirators (instead of masks) are preferred.
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use by an emergency use authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but are not guaranteed effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not stipulated in the product indications.
Where no masks are available, CDCs recommend the use of protective masks or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most cases of VOCID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is being actively studied for people hospitalized with respiratory impairment related to COVIDA-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive bipression in the airways.
It is not yet known whether any of these two provide the same benefit to people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Serious cases occur mainly in adults older than 60 years and, in particular, those older than 80 years.
Many developed countries do not have enough beds per head in hospitals, which limits the ability of the health system to manage the sudden increase in serious cases of VOCID-19 requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with VOCID-19 are finally transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ADRS) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators that have different modes of pressure control and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen supply, while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not have high PPTE.
Research into possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The remorse seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may take up to 2021, several drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with severe illness.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of possible treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation to convalescent plasma as experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been subjected to the necessary clinical studies to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect the "close contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-containment, but also alerts local health officers. Analysis of cell information macrodata, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those with whom they were in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to track data from mobile phones of persons suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summary data on the location of telephones with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine failures.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile phone operators have informed him that "in any case, 40% of people are still moving."
The German Government carried out a 48-hour weekend hack with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonia's President, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global request for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may be distressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, and side effects of treatment or fear the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety about health, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can follow a mild evolution with few or no symptoms, so it will look like other diseases in the upper respiratory tract, such as common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while serious or critical cases may take three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may run the risk of getting a serious infection with the VOCID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SARG and SROM virus, but the VOCID-19 data are insufficient. In some people, VOCID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In cases of greater severity, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to the respiratory water difficulty syndrome (SDRA) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organic failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorder and cardiac, renal and hepatic damage.
Coagulation alteration, specifically the increase in protombin time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with VOCID-19; whereas renal function alteration is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30 % of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average of seven days elapsed between hospitalization and death.
In a study of incipient cases, the mean time from the onset of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a complete interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate among males was 2.8% and among females was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromixoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes in pneumocytes were observed.
The image of the lungs resembled acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (ADRS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, cardiac damage resulted from high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data from March of the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had a pre-existing condition. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of disease mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The underreporting of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of VOCID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. They are concerned about the long-term consequences of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20-30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung images suggest organ damage.
This can also cause the syndrome after intensive care after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated long-term effective immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but recovered cases of COVID-19 have been reported which subsequently gave positive in coronaviruses.
These cases are believed to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin, by means of an interspecific infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of VOCID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, indicated that the first date of onset of symptoms as at 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
In general, a number of measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, in addition to being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned CIE-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 to deaths with confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection laboratory and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of VOCID-19 without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection laboratory. The lethality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the overall lethality rate is 6.9% (153 822/240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
The figure varies by region. Other measures include the lethality rate in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people dying from a disease, and the lethality rate in infected people, which reflects the percentage of infected people (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected persons produce antibodies, their presence may provide information on how many people were infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small villa of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected younger people, resulting in relatively low mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been surpassed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004% of the population) died from VOCID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for males and females.
Mortality is higher among males in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only narrowed to 90s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in males and 1.7 in females.
The exact reasons for this difference by sex are not known, but could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Immunological differences based on sex, the lower number of women who smoke and the fact that males have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at an earlier age, could have contributed to the higher mortality rate in males.
In Europe, 57% of infected persons were males and 72% of those killed by VOCID-19 were males.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not track sex information in HIV infections of VOCID-19.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARA, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, in particular nursing staff, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations under designation to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease for 2019-nCOV as temporary names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials, such as nasal hyspos and parts of respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed the valve of a respirator and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, a local emerging company did reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves during the night.
After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19, theories of conspiracy, false information and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly over the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no medicines or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and researchers in the sector are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for VOCID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Test" to assess the therapeutic effects of the four most promising antiviral compounds in terms of efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the receptor ECA2 to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers seek to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection by the VOCID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on protein S that helps the virus get into the receptor ECA2.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA vaccines or RNA, a new technique for creating vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a four-volunteer vaccine in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains an innocuous copy of the genetic code of the virus causing the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Re-adapted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, including nine phase III trials on resuscisors in several countries and are due to report at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments in vaccine and potential drugs against COVID-19 was under way. Several antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, including resuscisiver, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta, were evaluated.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence on the effectiveness of resuscisors.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate remorse use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results obtained were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer review for the investigation.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it points out that twice that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with VOCID-19. The 7th edition of Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or humifenovir against VOCID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. The studies have shown that the initial cebate of protein S that performs type 2 transmembranary serine-proteinase (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with the receptor ECA2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant limitations that prevent the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known role in the treatment of VOCID-19.
The release of cytokines may be a complication of the last stages of serious VOCID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines. China's National Health Commission included tocilizumab in treatment regimens after completion of a small study.
It is found in a national non-randomized Phase II test in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a blood test of serum ferritin to identify cytokine releases, these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some infected people, will be countered.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes in 2017.
To date, there is no unrandomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from VOCID-19 to people who need them as a passive immunisation method without vaccines is being investigated.
This strategy was tested with the SARG with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive treatment with antibodies can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with antibodies are being developed, for example using monoclonal antibodies manufactured.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
