A triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria led to a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current large coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the current President Wilhelm Molterer's position is seriously threatened, suffers from particularly large losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphal return to the political scene at the national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remained, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared with the 2006 elections, lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The ÖVP, with 25.6 per cent losing almost nine per cent of the votes, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the people's party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable advance on the SPÖ.
However, voters obviously punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations were pronounced about the possible resignation of the party leader and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, at the extraordinary board of the party's leadership.
Such a change would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the election which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the large SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repeat of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separated from it) on a common government, which even raised sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he was ready to work with any party and that he planned to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently put on this evolution.
The last party to have access to parliament being the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell, among the Austrian political parties, from the third in fifth position.
Obviously, no other party crosses the limit of four percent and does not access parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If the problem of Czech researchers accused in India, accused of illegal caffron collection, could not be resolved, the Czech Foreign Minister said, Karel Schwarzenberg, would follow a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister declared it today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he observed after the meeting, carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the talks, that the executive branch could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was dismissed from the charge and punished by a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of the Darjeling, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could request bail and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner also expressed himself in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide "competent legal support" to convicted persons, mentioned the Indian Minister.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
"We want above all to maintain with India the best relations, which have a tradition continuing over many years.
The Indians also recognize it," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We regard the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers as a great contempt," he said.
The minister evades the question if he has obtained from India the promise to deal with the matter.
"I have already received quite a number of promises," he says only.
A Czech arbitrates the fight for the seabed
It is approaching a wall electronic map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent sea floor.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of thirty members of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the director of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and the complete from time to time.
Working ardour and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world little known so far, rich in natural resources.
There are oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms that are currently unknown, which may contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A wider bottom than the land closes
The coastal states have now begun to vehemently aspire to the new submarine territories.
According to a United Nations convention, they used their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shell, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, claim exclusively to all resources of the continental shell.
"To simplify, it is considered as continental shell the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the said exclusive economic yone," Mikulka explains.
The request made by the country concerned to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many costly explorations and mestria.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the committee with legal and scientific technical assistance.
To date, the Committee has dealt with five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the time being, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," Mikulka adds.
Australia's success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its underwater possessions, has recently experienced a worldwide resounding trend.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed allocated to it by the Commission last week - equals 1.6 million square kilometres, which represents the country's sixfold extent.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefits they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they plan, be invaluable.
In turn, other countries will gradually submit their demands.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shell ends, the zone of the ocean floor begins, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no state enjoys an exclusive position anymore.
The right of extraction in this area is conferred by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, let's not be mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," said exaggerating Director Mikulka, stating that "its areas are clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former bloc of the countries of L'est within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
It obtained in 1991, under the Convention, as well as from investors from a few other states, the status of the so-called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati Islands.
The area envisaged by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is enlivened, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract over an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, gives an example of such a achievement.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoot, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The German Special Forces were on site for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had called for Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - the experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready, but they never went to action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are revealed.
According to instructions from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German Special Forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both federal army specialists and GSG 9 officials from the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as Technischen Hilfwerk logistics experts, were at the scene of the release.
As the spokesman for the Ministries communicated on Monday evening, the German forces were eventually not required, as hostage-takers released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian Government would have accepted Germany's assistance in integrating it on the spot as a support force.
"Happily, this has not happened so far," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The aggressors had abducted in southern Egypt the group of tourists composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transhipped into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has remained vague until now, as has the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who were saved in the meantime arrived safely and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the hostages released were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin at the moment, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five vacationers and the special forces should have taken off aboard an Airbus from the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
United States House of Representatives Refuses Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress soon failed the 700 billion dollar heavy financial market rescue plan.
The Dow Jones creaked in the abyss.
With 227 votes against 206, the United States House of Representatives rejected the bailout plan for the government's financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was supposed to jugulate the chaos of the financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic manoeuvre, the supporters had desperately tried to convince opponents of the soundness of this $700 billion heavy plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called on Members to vote in favour, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for the avoidance of something that has not yet happened," he conceded.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of the investors that the state rescue plan could overturn.
It went back shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts are now planning new, serious turbulence on international financial markets.
In order for the program to come into force, approval and approval of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are necessary.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In the case of reservations for the next few months according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite poor economic prospects, German travel thirst remains insatiable according to this study.
As regards reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period last year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) had in Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute survey, increasing numbers of bookings already dominate autumn months.
Thus the sales figure would have risen to about 11 percent compared to 2007, according to the VRD.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which monthly analyses the booking data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the US would be particularly requested, said the DRV.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about one Third.
Alongside this, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as our country, would be particularly sought after by the Germans.
Specially organized trips are highly requested, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising energy and food prices, the costs here would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individual organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with early booking discounts or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been widely held so that an increase in sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuously, beer in pints per litre and celebrities in Tyrolean designer costumes.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, television animator and wears a custom-cut Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves at us and fill out their memory card - very flattering, and this is my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to reach its goal.
As a beer holiday tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my feeling of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in Therese Square, everything is half the worse.
Each or almost wears a Tyrolean costume or leather pants; no one looks blasphemed or embarrassed - that's completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume picks up some strange eyes at the banana-choco stand.
A Bavarian woman points out to me that I would have wrongly attached my apron: "left means free, in the virgin middle, in the married right, in the widow's back."
Discreetly, I tweak my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she tells me and laughs.
Others do not give themselves as much harm for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which it is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us their naked back-train without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is named Bob, comes from England and comes for the first at the beer party.
He finds it "gorgious," with an elongated ooooo.
He tells me all this after he relieved himself of the cup he had drunk before.
Right next to this fire mouth that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob's one of those sadly famous "wild hunters."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol that way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, ribbles of rescuers run in the place of the feast and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene rather in the pack - always by four, they drag their stretcher covered with tents in tents.
That's how it works for most of the visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we come back full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the drunks under the tarpaulin are not visible.
"They're the ones who can't swallow anything anymore," one of the rescuers yells at me in response to my question and then disappears into the mix.
Accident victim identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the accident Friday afternoon in town on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested because he was suspected of dangerous driving.
He's been released since, on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey planned to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, 20 steps away from Asia, is one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the guides tell us.
The monument is situated on a horse at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each of its angles, such as some German provincial townships.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no doubt as to the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retard in the game of imperialism, wanted to achieve its medieval ambitions of domination through this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as has the land best known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and empire forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
The Turkish sources state that this is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, swallowed up in the meanders of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to underline the widening of the diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War
Now it's time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a car-bed towards the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit the Turkish MP AKP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half-hour journey, shaken on noisy rails whose pace reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning my back on his German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots is an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built of stones and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by semi-built shopping centers and many pastry shops in which middle managers in costume-clavate-men and women- meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie, and he even has a Black Berry.
" the purpose of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its hind country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case with either of us.
She had to do both.
"but, at some point, "I asked if" Turkey should not choose?"
"Turkey," he said, "does not want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out one aspect that almost all those with whom I was able to speak to have recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway does not only go to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, it is therefore as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to draw a Europe that travels metaphorically on the tracks to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha railway station, after another night without sleep, I thought of these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been named "the sick man of Europe".
At least there is no longer any doubt on the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Vernon Handley's memoirs, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic choir of young people, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include the under 21 years old, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music was presented to it, whether it be madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod told us to "let music speak for itself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all here in music.
So sing!"
Its baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named a knight, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the 1962 to 1982 decades when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me- and, sometimes, they even inspired me
Tod Handley had such a rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated the drivers who, according to him, "focus only on certain people".
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died September 25) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research in 1950, while he was doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD".
This is what comes from Woodruff's letter in Beyond Nab End, but this is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor in economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time finished a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino, Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "the Flamenco and Life" because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have drawn attention to me because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda's super sales
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
To this is added some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more gasoline.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
So it's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz presents a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation's marketing.
First of all, it is observed that Honda has renovated this model within a shorter time frame than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less well known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it is thinking about selling 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The Spanish branch hopes to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to palpate in large part the decrease in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand hopes to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, that is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, which is a 16% decrease in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year around the world.
Depending on the markets and according to Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 meters (five centimetres more), its width is 1.69 meters (two centimetres more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimetres.
On the other hand, the height does not change at 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and the interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a gas reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the safe - which has a double bottom system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of additional capacity compared to the safe of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with an 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or panoramic roof - is improving access to rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, starting from the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2- and 1.4-litre petrol thrusters.
Both engines have i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2 litre engine develops a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 nm torque at 4,900 rpm.
This propellant - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous thruster, which on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horsepower has combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Centre developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, BR23C represents the development of the Nissan safety shield.
This robot will allow brand vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee created its own personal space of an oval shape that much resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important is the eyes composed of the bee, able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles that lie within a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor immediately to avoid the obstacle.
"When it detects an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bifurcing its wheels of 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles, "explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Movement Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotational function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
" Every second this device must only process information and act according to this data.
It doesn't need to keep the information or intuitive logics of pre-manufacturing, that's why it can run continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we don't talk about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes."
This represents the first step towards developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced into serial cars in about ten years after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be recognized that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without geniuses.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to fail: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That's 'The Hotel of Bad Credits'... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Hotel Master leads us to think several times if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is sure that this game gives useful information but little detail.
It's more of a game for teenagers.
What if the game is over?
Because a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new one hosted by a sharp drop in its stock exchange price.
One week after unveiling an interim agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of regular shares Morgan Stanley at a unit price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The price retained is 19% lower than the book value of securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28% above its current price.
Morgan Stanley, however, lost 6.79 percent at $23.07 around 5:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status," explained John Mack, the CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but put him under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more prudent attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, he explained to Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the Executive Director of MUFG, "we thought that participation would be entirely composed of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into ordinary shares within one year if they exchange more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at approximately $47, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
However, a spokesperson for the group refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to display a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said that he's been "baked" on his balance sheet since late August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which saw its stock exchange price melt by half while the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt was flying.
This cost fell on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the redemption of Merrill Lynch, announced that he raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, he was the third to put a draft new Constitution to the vote.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results of 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the polls and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a large "yes" victory, between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday night to Monday.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly," he said, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place calmly according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), covered a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" advocated by the President.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the State on the economy, by reserving to it the "planning of development" of a country living mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies sent by its emigrants.
Brought by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives enhanced powers to the Head of State, who will be able to carry out up to two consecutive terms of four years and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it would use this power and challenge a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in that country 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back this Monday healthy and safe in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at about 3:30 p.m. on a special plane at the military base of al-Maza, hosted at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, aboard helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examination.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers," said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
Captured on 19 September during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been swept from one cache to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 Special Forces personnel, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of gunshots took place, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fleeing," said the official who requested the anonymity.
He indicated that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "light" unit had been sent to Sudan in total, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The previous day, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on a patrol where the kidnappers were on board, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unit Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place and is taking place in this election campaign.
Good.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise up to denounce the amounts of misery given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are starving?
What politician dares to remind the federal government that he neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on restoring the only castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in their country's Constitution that heritage protection is part of the American culture and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with three under private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers throw their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When, a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Holland bank, as the first European banking institution in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalising it. The three countries support, to a sum of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution also having interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this matter, also by calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition manager.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has grown for more than a year is for Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy nearly half (up to 49%) of the bank's capital in each country.
The bank will undoubtedly sell part of its stakes, among which, first and foremost, the activities, mainly insurance, it acquired last year from the Dutch agency ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares started a dizzying fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to let it go bankrupt.
Just on Friday, the company's shares fell by 12 percent to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the present value of the shares, the total value of the capital of the group revolves around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company's leaders, is unrealistic.
The company's management is facing the uncertainty of the other Atlantic, in relation to the adoption of the US $700 billion rescue plan, to be the cause of the fall of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the head of the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received any proposals on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's customer circle and no agency was attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that link the use of information regarding prescriptions of medicinal products, in all cases, to the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise this is to entrust his chicken to a fox" - recalled Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescriptions for drugs, at the Washington Post.
Insurance companies rely on the insurance premium and the insured capital in the event of injury, the health status of the client, and if they feel the risk is too high, they do not even guarantee it.
In the past, they sent candidates to a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after they became aware of the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, it is easily provided to pharmacies, the data on the purchase of medication from the person in the last eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person suffers from and what his state of health is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts him in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. At the same time, some determine a risk coefficient, so there is no longer much to be done to the insurer other than paperwork. However, tiny problems may still arise.
Among the disadvantages of this program are the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or heat puffs, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers to be an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data, and they must apply for permission from the patient before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are constrained by the authorities, even if they have not been sanctioned for their past failings.
Recently, some companies have also been processing laboratory analysis results, linking them with data on drug use, and in this way they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and the control of use is becoming more and more difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the expansion of the control circle of authorities concerning companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent or not, since if he or she refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
Thus and in the end, chickens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are increasing their trade by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit next to the other problems, largely global.
Today, there will also be a France-India Summit, where cooperation in the field of atomic energy will be the main issue.
The European Union recognizes that India is a major emerging democratic power to which a broader right of speech should be given in international affairs, but member countries have not yet managed to agree on their support in New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not focus too much on this issue yesterday at this 9th summit in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Head of Diplomacy Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would multiply trade by two, which means a rise of about 100 billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods has risen from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be a too ambitious objective.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, and air trade will also be able to grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only in ninth place among EU partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and there was an urgent need to hold a United Nations conference on this issue.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic substances by at least 20 per cent until 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as on the need for a global market at next year's climate conference, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent until 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State is now going to the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to information from the press agency, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
A strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition, more than 7 miles exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition, and Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Property and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Papillon: in fact, Italy will be present institutionally, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by an appointment with the press in Room Struktur, in the butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books gradually decreases in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular in relation to that for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire missing a year ago.
The wreck of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying in the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at 3000 metres above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, overcame the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it is the one on which Steve Fosset was traveling the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore specified that no human remains were found on or around the aircraft.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreck was spotted, a team of investigators sent to the scene, identified the aircraft: it was Bellanca 8kcab, disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal effects were found by a couple around their Mammoth Lakes residence.
These are two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's research was interrupted one month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world round on an aerostatic balloon in 2002, two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had flown around the world without a stopover.
Among all these records, also that of stealing at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect.
An unusual 4x4 of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, broad surfaces and net angles.
This is, in summary, Glk, the last born off road "compacts" of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a new wind in this sector.
Just because of its out-of-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, starting on October 17.
Thus the publicity beat that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan's shopping centre, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, we will have the impression that by looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative technology Eliminator8, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to generate the interest of future buyers? We will see well.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian national team for years, and who, so far, had never created major problems.
Never had he encountered the opposing typhosis.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (less actually) of Campania and Puglia were added.
They had tricolor flags on which their original city appeared: Saturday night, they were all removed so that they were not identified.
They are inspired by the English typos.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhose of true Nazis, the Levski.
The Figc had made available the Italian typosi, 144 tickets for the part: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And indeed the Viminal had all controlled them: among those who went to Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian typos who had a history of stage crime, did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the actions that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take measures: in this case, it may be that the typosi arrested or identified in the disorder purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits frequent Italian but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now it's time for fear-emulation: that is to say, others are likely to add to the first hundred and fifty.
"We must extinguish this fire immediately, and do not legitimize it that way," says Viminal.
So, "keep your eyes open especially in view of the national team game of Wednesday in Lecce"
In the Puglia there is indeed a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Aise, i.e. secret services, which deal precisely with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime"
Here is the view (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Observatory of the Viminal (he took the post of Francesco Taggliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a prefect in Trieste, where there is a nucleus of supporters from the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 typhosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the No.1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the Country in which the fact occurs.
So far, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see what has happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about whistles about Mameli's anthem: these too are not crimes, but if you'll excuse me, they're not polite..."
