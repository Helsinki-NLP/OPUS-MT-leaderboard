Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" above Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over Bogota, Colombia's capital, on Thursday.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination of wings), it rose to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate shrine, located at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many badads had gathered to observe its feat.
A black box in your car?
While the planners of the U.S. road network have difficulty finding the money needed to repair the decrepit highway infrastructure, there are many who see a solution in the form of a small black box that is fixed above your car's dashboard.
The aircraft, which records every mile travelled by a motorist and transmits information to officials, is at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to redesign the obsolete system of financing the major American roads.
The generally uninterested sector of the planning of the major axes has suddenly provoked a lively debate and a stirred alliance.
The libertarians joined ecologist groups to lobby for the government to use small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly of the road you travel on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while the members of Congress fail to agree on whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they can move to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS surveillance system, for an experimental shift.
This is really essential for our nation.
"It's not like we have a choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director General of the Southern California Association of Governments, which predicts that the state will start recording the miles travelled by every California driver by 2025.
There's going to be some change in how we pay those taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with the taxes that Americans pay to the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can travel more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
"The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed trackers on 500 cars to test a payment system by mile.
"It turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Wonks calls this from usage charges to mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces urban liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California's planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the government's ambitious climate-warming laws.
But representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa), Chairman of the House of Representatives Transport Committee, said that he also considered it the most viable alternative in the long term.
Supporters of the free market of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of paying drivers a mile.
"It's not just a tax going into a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice-president of politics at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they receive.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go along the road to payment by the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved approximately 10,000 cars.
But the House Presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who must travel many miles every day to their work or city.
However, several States and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country's most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay the state a kilometric fee instead of gas taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the east coast of the United States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where approximately 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government would be able to follow their own actions and actions.
"The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads strategic performance management in the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the test, the Nevada ACLU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into fully located devices."
It is not necessary to build an enormous and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily goings and comings.
Nevada is one of the few States that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the State to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to use a small California start-up called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to assist motorists who pay taxes to States.
She sought to break into the emerging auto insurance market, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices it tests have pleased the planners of the major axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and locate them," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less expensive means and far less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state.
Other States hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than enough.
In New York City, transport officials are seeking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide "pay-to-driving" insurance and create a real-time speed data set from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits offered by the system," said a paper on urban development.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the whole debate on mile payment is simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say that Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on gasoline.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
"It's not necessary to resort to radical surgery when you just need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs at the commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a bunch of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unpublished Listeners
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he designed a luxury reissue scheduled for 4 November, with several new ones.
Four have already emerged on the web.
The announcement of the release of David Bowie's new album had left everyone pantois.
On the day of his 66th birthday, on January 8, 2013, he stated that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dates from 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that one could still count on him to sparkle the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
Not after all, David Bowie had more than one lap in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke has thus planned to reissue this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, new studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three songs of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: photos and exclusive pouches, a notebook to share its own impressions, a booklet with the words...
And, above all, it gives a taste of its new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and cleverly mastered rock electricity.
Unpublished ones already listening to
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the canvas.
The Informer is double-faced: a disturbing intro before a luminous cavalcade that gradually slows down to give way to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John's Rocket Man or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has feet on earth.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The enchanting guitar riffs make you want to leave Earth.
Bowie has fun playing the chameleon with these titles: round-the-clock informant, man aboard a rocket, Martian potential...
He hides and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photograph of the campaign L'Invitation au Voyage, of the brand Louis Vuitton, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from November 10th.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers prior to their return to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers received appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them were released before they were ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured members - who do not meet the "universality of service" rule of the army requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by La Presse Canadienne, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, with post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to stay one more year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before he was ready because he did not meet the universal rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins emphasized that a soldier could be prepared from, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was any way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been struggling to determine what latitude it can give injured soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not capable of fighting.
Under current rules, seriously wounded soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal spokesman for veterans, Jim Karygiannis, called for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins on Wednesday, while neo-Democratic Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice."
Disney set on tablets to launch an animated series
The American Disney media and entertainment group has decided to focus the tablets on its own television channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 at watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on Disney Channels is scheduled for 2014, detailing its Disney Junior division's release.
The animated drawing, intended for children aged 2 to 7, tells of the adventures of the cat Callie, sheriff of a western American city where she rules the order with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, Vice President for Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the press release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the life of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important," he added.
A survey published at the beginning of the week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of those under 2 years of age had already used a tablet or telephone, and 72% of those under 8 years of age, respectively, compared with 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "co-operate" with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence denunciator, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he enjoyed the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts has clearly been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Ministry of Justice, he is charged with espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of the Interior, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to the German officials, we will make this possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany have been severely tested in response to complaints that the NSA has been listening to the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign intelligence, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States", it was necessary to take advantage of it.
Mr Ströbele, German Member of Parliament Vert, published a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to counsel for the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he should be assured that he would be "safe" there, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "serious and sustained" persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global reaction to "my act of political expression".
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – felt that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public use.
The letter provides an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately Netflix video service on demand via their television in the future that doesn't seem that far away.
Cogeco's subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will enable us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces and more options," said Cogeco's president and CEO, Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Câble is thus in line with its competitors, such as Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary has not yet a specific date for this new platform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our clients do not currently have access to.
The Rogers telecommunications giant has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussions with some major cable operators to make its service available via their broadcast platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to provide customers with the opportunity to pay for services on a à la carte basis.
"It's been about two and a half years since we said that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important chain packages doesn't work," said Audet.
He hoped, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"It will need to emerge from these discussions a kind of new frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy with respect to television," said Cogeco.
The CRTC has been consulting with the public since last week and should continue with the industry next spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco reported having recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ per share.
This is a decrease compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, of the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company is responsible for this decline due to depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired in 2012 the Atlantic Broadband cable operator, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after that which had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Entreprises, an Internet provider established in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
As for Cogeco's revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, of the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's revenues increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the 2013 fiscal year, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is up 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about the number of customers fluctuating like this.
For me, this is not the indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with a very strong competition.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat was found in cans of beef products, sold by two small British retail brands at low prices, today announced the Food Hygiene Agency.
Routine testing revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA at 1 to 5%.
"Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal about the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles caused four injured, early Friday, on Highway 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist who was travelling north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of both vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic had returned to normal around 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them to the plane's descent.
The new cost of hand luggage concerns the bags stored in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier stated that it would pay $25 if the charges were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers only paid once at the boarding gate.
Border Spokesman Kate O'Malley indicated that the $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the fees in advance.
"We don't want to charge this price," she explained.
Airlines began charging first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these costs put as much as they could in the hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no room in these compartments.
These costs are a way to ensure that passengers carry less things on board.
O'Malley stated that these new fees will not really be used to raise money.
It is a matter of making it clear to the most loyal customers of Frontier that it becomes increasingly difficult to find room in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline's website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger tailing a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the tail might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that the site and border registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know about these charges before arriving at the door.
Frontier's hand luggage costs will not be applied until the summer, although no dates have been set.
Passengers often rouse about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that the cost of handling baggage is significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street consider adding baggage charges as a sign that airlines pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Yet many of them did not pay for luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand luggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant company followed a little later.
The only other company that imposes such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant with airlines Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the surcharge fees.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit's hand luggage costs were $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines manager, recently travelled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate when passengers discovered the unusual baggage charges imposed by the company.
"I've never seen such a fluid boarding process in my entire career," he said.
I was expecting to see teeth scratches and a fight burst at the door.
The aircraft was full, he added, "the passengers were on board at the speed of the lightning."
Frontier also acts as Spirit and applies $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take soda or fruit juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
It will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly attempted to charge for drinks in 2008 but returned back seven months later after the passengers complained and no other major airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, she began offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their tickets via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced the premiums by 25 per cent on a trip.
Thus, a 1,000-mile border trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly from the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in its home town, Denver, but its activity backs and it loses money.
Revenues fell by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to straighten out Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
NSA is calling into question an "internal error" and not computer hackers for its site's failure
The National Security Agency working in the shadows stated Friday that it was a bug that had caused its public site to fail for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.
"NSA.gov has remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," said the spy agency in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a denial of service [DSD] attack are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the Agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson explained.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the NSA site failure through a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the system concerned.
The NSA once ultra-secret, once known as the "No Such Agency", found itself under the fire of the projectors and strongly criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive communications monitoring programs at the national and abroad levels – which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and released by NSA's former disused consultant, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has caused a lot of speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
The Delta City Centre now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville Hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 still haven't found a new job.
Delta promises not to drop her employees.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, and individual employees were met to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the Regional Director of Labour Relations of Delta Hotels, Felix Bisson.
The Delta closure is taking place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue to operate it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totalling nearly 600 rooms will be open within two years.
For Titan's CEO, "Goodyear Amiens' purchase project starts with zero employee"
After throwing the sponge with fail in January for the partial resumption of the Goodyear site of North Amiens promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American pneumatician Titan, says today, ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the factory counts.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced this on Monday, October 21.
After giving up the plant's purchase project in January, you come back today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of "meaning workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "fous" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this turnaround.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment too.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries eight hours of disability work in France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I don't have any prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But with a fair price and skilled workers, it's worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If Goodyear had offered employees a good severance pay since the plant was announced, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys the closed factory from Goodyear.
Therefore, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
But he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from the approximately 1,200 current employees of Goodyear.
Also, does Mr. Montebourg need a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on severance benefits for all employees.
Therefore, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to secure these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance benefits.
If all employees accept them, the plant purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide long-term guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg succeeds in getting the CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan to buy the plant, we intend to stay at Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier's profit is down, while aircraft deliveries and orders are down
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aeronautical and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% fall in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from a decrease in aircraft orders and deliveries during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide flight test data for his brand-new CSeries aircraft or information to determine whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial commissioning schedule by September.
After the inaugural flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the pilot only flew three times, and the question arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
The results were not up to the forecast and the share price fell by 8% at the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday, from "overperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential to raise the stock exchange in the next quarter or two quarters.
"Although the decline in aircraft deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Division," said Cameron Doerksen in a note to customers.
We believe Bombardier will record new orders for his CSeries aircraft as the flight test program moves forward.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the family of CSeries aircraft will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and first flew in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft has so far been modest at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airline.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 purchase orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft is put into commercial service.
Leaders also reassured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was moving forward in line with the schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft's stop time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We had decided to proceed with a first flight and to schedule an update period, and that is what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly afterwards, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that she was evaluating the start-up schedule and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This slow flight test – although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be delayed in the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, one year earlier.
The result per adjusted action remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Income declined slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 million.
Analysts expected a result of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth aircraft manufacturer indicated that it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 a year earlier.
Net controls fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 before.
The delay in the Aeronautics Division was $32.9 million as at September 30, which was unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues decreased by 13% to $2M.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, said the revenues of this division had increased by almost 11% to $2.1 million.
The Transport Division's order book totaled $32.6 million as at September 30, a slight increase from December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have suffered from problems in the execution of some major contracts.
Leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's course of action, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer of Google Inc, would sit on the Board of Directors, fell from 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest and closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10% reduction in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists had been missing in a gulf under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday evening, it was learned Friday from the Speleo aide de l'Isère.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one guerre à la pratique and the other not, had gone underground on Thursday at 9:30 p.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We were then without news of them since, specified the same source.
"Speleologists should have come out around 5:00 in the morning," said Thierry Larribe, technical advisor at Speleo Relief in charge of the relief organization.
Dozens of people on site
About twenty rescue workers, ten civilians members of the French Relief Spéléo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13th Battalion of the Chambéry Alpine Hunters were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They lost themselves in the network, returned to their steps while waiting for help, specified the prefecture.
Refueled, they should come out of the cavity with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union invited its members on Thursday to stop using the online services of Google and Yahoo in the wake of new revelations about the activities of the US and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo search engines and messaging until further notice," she says in a press release.
It considers "scandalous" information from the Washington Post, according to which the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) collected mass information by infiltrating international networks that allow both firms to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union who claims 38,000 members.
Repeated lamps: a deputy asks for the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
Minister Brigitte Grouwels' project of "relifting" the posts of the signalling lights in Brussels does not appeal to everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched a test project in central Brussels on Thursday, which consists of 16 posts of signal lights from the region in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The aim is both "to increase security" and "the Brussels identity".
The idea is ultimately to repaint all the Brussels signalling lights, at an estimated cost of approximately EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content to spend the money of the Bruxellois madly in re-alifting operations of the signal poles in the colors of the Bruxello region, Brigitte Grouwels continues his operations of Flemishization of the Capital," says Mr. De Bock in a statement.
After her yellow-black-mango taxis, she finally painted herself in dark-blue-black yellow posts in Brussels.
According to the Member, there is now no more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels.
The Bruxellois deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who herself carries out the NVA program.
It's high time to stop the Trojan horse from Flanders.
"For a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2,245 votes being 0.5% of the Bruxellois!" concludes Mr. De Bock.
the portico of Pont-de-Buis disassembled
The eco-tax portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national road was diverted in the wake.
The decision of the dismantling, announced by the prefecture of Finistère Wednesday, was made by Ecomouv, the portico manager.
This is the last of the three eco-tax ports operating in the Department of Finistère, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory shop for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google's signed connected glasses.
This allows them to purchase a headphone, a charger or a storage case.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of micro-fibers or an intra-atrial headphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction lenses, no large-scale marketing dates have yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father erased himself from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue to "freak it".
There is no recipe, no way to get through the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then there were signs.
The first time this was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a sweet awakening in the middle of the night to watch his watch that no longer leaves me, placed on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
That's at least what I thought the day I found his body empty, creaked on that hospital bed with frizzy sheets.
Similarly, his funeral was a glacial farewell focused around the thin glow of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, by small daytime or nighttime appearances, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she resumed her place in the landscape of my thought that believed she was mourning.
And then she revealed herself to me while revealing my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person at all but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who embodied that person during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and released the person I loved, and here I found her, full and whole.
This detour of the way of my life remains the most unexpected and most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "in and out," he seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed him at the time.
I had a hard relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was scared, when I got hurt...
He was talking to me, constantly encouraging me, living in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said that the deceased are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week it's certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it's too late, only, there's always one thing that prevents me from fulfilling this moment.
I often wake up distressed when it happens to me and feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams take me on the contrary and enroll in my history and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
On the eve of my ultrasound where I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamed that I was waking up, I was out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor and he smiled and was glad that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to signify that he was joyfully sharing what was happening to me.
And of course, he was a little boy in my belly.
I liked to share this moment with him and I am pleased to tell this common memory lived after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year earlier, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused to the young bachelor I was at the time.
Yet I realized my grief quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in times when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
To learn Arabic and to be interested in the Middle East, to the point of making a master's degree in a great school, were not, with the reverse, anotin choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and speak of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she inculcated me are always present, so I happen to think about how she would like me to act at some point.
The same applies to my attitudes: I am trying to live up to the generosity and rightness of the spirit of the one who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes laying on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
Death after talking to me on the phone.
I have been through all phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, crying that triggers itself, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then time calmed down.
Only the lack, this emptiness without answer, this need for her, to entrust me, to reassure me in the depths of her sweetness.
Yet, she's here, silent presence, she's here and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see his worried eyes standing on me, I see the circles that overwhelm his gaze, the wrinkles around the lips that the cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the front on the days of concern.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes around.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at 43 years of age.
We feel his protection all the time, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so little by little we learned to smile, and to pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the middle of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the morale is a little high.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the setback of time makes us realize how much she was conductor and we try to stay in the way she had set us.
If a being loved you very much, the absence can't take it out of your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 after asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I could not attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs sometimes different from his, I still wonder if my actions are consistent with his vision of things.
In fact, I have had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep and I always wonder what he'll think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is that genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was kind of like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
Anyway, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It was almost thirty years ago that my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 and our son was 6 years old.
The immense pain that then invaded me has, of course, eased but it is still close to me.
Very often he "disembarked" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that at waking up I am even sadder to see that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I told him no, he answered me "I'm going down" but with such a real voice that I woke up in distress, and I turned on the bed lamp looking everywhere, convinced it was going to happen.
I always live in the same house, and often, I feel watched and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and or her mind lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I've always lived alone since he left, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to say that I am sociable with a job of responsibility, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the bloodiest month since 2008
October has been in Iraq the most murderous month since April 2008.
Baghdad published official figures this Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Prime Minister of Iraq is received by the President of the United States.
Noury al-Maliki is looking for help from the United States.
"We don't tell the world to be with us and support ourselves, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," said Al-Maliki this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what happens in Iraq is not settled, it will spread, and what happens in Syria will spread as well.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? It spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They branded banners accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs would be revealed at large.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Liverpool Court of Seats
A large defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough regarding investigations into his drug trafficking activities after having compromised himself because of his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed Bash and considered by the criminals as a "principal file", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32 years old, laying three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a Bar dinner with fellows.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought unlawfully to obtain information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for an amount of £1.5 million, as well as more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would be revealed in the open.
Today, at Liverpool's Court of Assizes, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Solicitors law firm in Blackburn, fell into disconcertion after being convicted of two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been regularly in telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, pure 60%, under the lawyer's garbage in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the football stadium in Ewood Park, pregnant with the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went back to his house, discovered the drugs, and they phoned nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but denied the use of cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the suspected drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a sample of his hair was taken.
During an interrogation, he stated that he owned an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that clients sometimes called him home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimonies that he called for major actors in the drug trade, some of which he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know that the law should not be violated, he is a criminal lawyer."
Ditta is accused of having abused his position as a criminal lawyer, and of having become too involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He impeded the investigation of the police as much as he could to enable him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honour his profession, but dishonored it.
He has come too close to some customers, particularly Scarborough, and has allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said, "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide Mr. Scarborough with information, I wouldn't have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has gone from criminal to criminal lawyer himself as soon as he has begun to procure drugs from criminal organizations."
Its addiction to cocaine has forever compromised it and made it vulnerable to the afterthoughts of the leaders of organized criminal groups who have commissioned it to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and create a climate of public confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to shelter himself behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three charges of possession of cocaine and now obstructing justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecute criminals.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and translate you in court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years ' imprisonment for drug trafficking.
On his site, Ditta organized a question/answer session on himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death row in America, his last guest for dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be back on stage in December
Detroit News reports that the soul queen will take place on December 21 at the Sound Board room at the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
In November, Franklin was involved in recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she was suffering from, the famous interpreter of Respect told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult".
She claims to be "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lights
420 patterns, 2.2 kilometers of seaboard covered with a coat of light: you could rub the hot blow in Menton with the bill of illuminations.
Invoice which, unlike many communes, is increasingly settled by taxpayers, not by traders' associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses leds.
But also differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to the local police, there would be at least 2 wounded.
This would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Authority (TSA) and the perpetrator.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff have gone to the exits or to the tarmac.
Very quickly the police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is being interrupted.
Classical song for teens
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five saynets imagined and interpreted by artists from the region, cartoons with a high dose of humour, teenagers are allowed to learn classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Society of Lyric Art of the Kingdom will come back with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that now makes a full room at the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
In addition to these activities was the Apero lyrique, the concert-beneficiary held last August, with the help of the soprano colorature Marie-Eve Mugger.
It was a profit-making activity, parallel to the artistic dimension, and it helped the not-for-profit organization produce a financial balance that is as soft to the ears as an air of The bat.
Without delivering precise figures, the chairman of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of yesterday's press meeting in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is drawing well, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"Financials are on the air and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step that we will be going through in seven years," said the administrator.
"I'd say even beyond," said Executive Director Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Mustapha Hassan was accused of hostage-taking, kidnapping, making threats, carrying weapons in a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Paquet by means of a press release.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective redress against the brothers Sainte-Croix
A new application for collective redress was filed against the brothers Sainte-Croix, concerning sexual assaults that would have taken place this time at the oratory Saint-Joseph as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the testimony of the complainant, identified as "J. J.", who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher Brother Somis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the oratory Saint-Joseph, where he was serving as mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was limited to three institutions, and when we announced the settlement, many people told us: "I, I was in such a place, can I register?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The particular feature of the collective remedy that has just been filed is to allow complainants to be added to any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of St. Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The facts alleged are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the congregation of St. Croix and the oratory of St. Joseph, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "exercise moral, religious and psychological coercion over the victims", that they "was aware of and stifled sexual abuse", and that they "sciently and consciously chose to ignore the problem".
These latter accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the brothers Sainte-Croix, Me Emile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The collective remedy must first proceed to the stage of admissibility in the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility is accepted by the Court, the second stage is taken, namely, hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of St. Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were held on the merits.
Important fire in a business
A fire seriously damaged a business in LaSalle, Montreal, on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The relief was called around 1:00 a.m. on Friday, due to a fire that had declared itself in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were sent to the scene took nearly an hour to control the fire department.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said Montreal Fire Safety Service Chief Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on stage.
There were no injuries, but close to 20 dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross has been requested, as residents of one of the apartments may need to be accommodated on an interim basis, the SIM indicated.
A lot of opposition to medical help dying at the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, occurs a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the medical assistance bill to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a spokesperson from the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
With emphasis on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The President of the Palliative Care Network of Quebec also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the vice president of the Palliative Care House Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of Mathieu-Froment-Savoie's house in Gatineau, said the service would be useless anyway.
They never ask us, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill disorients the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, the Liberal Member of Parliament for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, states that the concept of end of life must be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan press indignant about controversial media law
"It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask ourselves the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" the newspaper said by challenging the bill and asking for it to be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites in Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would adversely affect Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and refer it to parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to "maintain the media." The Standard indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had suffered a hard blow" and fustigated the bill calling it "draconian."
The adoption of the bill is taking place at the same time as a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate mall last September.
Kenyan media have aroused the anger of the authorities by spreading images of video surveillance cameras on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack allegedly stole the luxury shopping center.
The chief of police, David Kimaiyo, reacted by summoning two journalists and one media officer to question them, although the summons was withdrawn following a lifting of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, the media will be liable to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "deleted" or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations."
He also said that measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animated blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist in The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Freed from themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering."
Kenyan legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Wages Commission and restored their migrating wages by about 532,000 shillings per month exempt from tax – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) in Laval caused a great deal of excitement to the management of the Cité-de-la-Santé Hospital in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short-term departures, the pharmacy department found itself severely understaffed.
Almost 30% of the required staff were missing, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
We didn't use troubleshooting, said Beaudet.
Some of our activities have been rationalized or decreased within the establishment for level, as long as things shift.
Of course, we have worked hard to interest our young people [residents in pharmacy] so that they come and stay here.
There's a circumstance contest that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this arduous period, the year 2013-2014 is much easier for the department of pharmacy of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back at work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain the students were successful, as the four students currently residing in Laval also decided to remain in the CSSS.
Now, it's much better, the pharmacist stressed.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will thus fill our departures from last year.
Still growing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have a middle that is young and we employ many young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always roll at three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and we don't have any pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model does not start his career at the cinema by the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to portray Charlotte Gainsbourg as a young woman in her next film, Nymphomaniac.
This Egrene pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a quadragen addicted to sex since his adolescence.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to her elder is striking: a figure of toast, a diaphanous complexion and French-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to lay bare on ice paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on large screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac caused the temperature to rise on the Web: Stacy Martin appears there in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their indifference to the closet, he used X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, passing through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing her actresses into their last hindrances, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A room of the CGR of Narbonne evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, as a result of tinglings in the throat felt by spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility had the room evacuated and warned the firefighters of a suspicious smell.
Approximately 70 people left the session.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room did not give anything.
Bad joke on tear jet bottom?
Or an involuntary incident?
It is always that the cinema management has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its clients in full.
The room was aired and everything went into order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and the customers regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She's trying to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins.
Taking advantage of Halloween Day, a woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins in the country on Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug could be detected.
Cocaine had been distributed into three pumpkins, which had previously been emptied.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman arrived when she was intercepted.
It's part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, CBSA spokesman.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montréal-Trudeau airport have carried out 173 seizures of drugs, including 10 seizures of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1653 seizures of narcotic drugs.
Air raid on military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday in the early afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of SA-8 short-range ground-to-air missiles would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new air raid of IDFal on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances roughly identical to the one that had taken place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, targeting this time ground-sea missiles Yakhont, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation of seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's public debt rating goes to "B-", falling into the speculative investment category.
It is accompanied by a negative perspective, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be lowered again within a year.
"It is less and less likely that the government's strategy will ensure sufficient foreign exchange to meet its high external financing needs," says the US agency.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves dropped by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of credits made abroad.
These reserves, to which the authorities have used massively to support the local currency, hryvnia, collapse, the agency increasingly considers a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of intense tension with its Russian neighbour, furious at Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered from its fifth quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it to be 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has been calling for aid from the International Monetary Fund for months, which in 2010 granted it $15.3 billion and has now released only $3.4 billion.
However, the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country adopts unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, particularly by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF noted this week that "important external financing needs" were "a vulnerability", while noting "significant signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "it is not possible to expect an improvement in the short term".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year", with presidential elections scheduled in 2015, the expert, interviewed at the AFP, said.
The only hope is an improvement in the international environment.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions for the release of opponent Ioulia Timoshenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia's reaction," S&P said, which fear "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for one quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that if a free trade area is created between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods.
United States Green Fire at the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they received no objections from the US authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the first global advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Onnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the deadline for the review of the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended", both groups announce in a press release.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the period of examination provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions granted in the other courts satisfy several of the conditions necessary for carrying out the operation.
"The merger is also conditional on other regulatory authorities and the approval of shareholders in both groups," they added.
The Congolese army hunts down the rebels of the M23
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were going to chase the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be about to be beaten after being driven from the locations of the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that it has been controlling since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurrection.
"We're going to sue the M23 and acquit it wherever it hides because it's criminals," said Colonel Olivier Hamuli, FARDC spokesman, to Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, told RFI that these military setbacks would not alter his demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to the Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
Clashes are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the insurgents to have fallen this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the rebellion of the M23 began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, head of the province of North Kivu, benefiting from the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of the Monusco.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of strength, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC General Staff was remodeled and the army went to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The rate of progress of government troops is unprecedented today.
"The M23 seems to be coming to an end," said a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic - it would be the first time the Kinshasa government has managed to defeat a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied with Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, which fiercely denies it, of military support for the M23, formed from former Congolese military mutiny.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, announced a spokesperson for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had referred to the possibility of military reprisals following shelling in Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entrance of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to be released by the army one day," says one resident of this bordering Uganda.
"We have lived in terror (of the M23), we are traumatized," added this man.
The tests carried out by the Institut Pasteur on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus proved to be negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of being reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed some 50 people.
Chevron, the second U.S. oil company, reported a decrease in its quarterly profit due to the decline in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining behind the group's objectives.
Its net profit in the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company targets 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in expected production by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures have increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Thus Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported on Thursday a net profit in decline, despite the increase in its production of gas and oil.
Transportation of schoolgirls: the complaint deemed admissible
Since the beginning of the school year, the Sherbrooke Region School Board (CSRS) has been charging $150 per student (up to $300 per family) for students receiving school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contributions were claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested," explains Ms. Lefèvre.
In her view, the CSIS was invited to mediation and requested an additional time to reflect on it.
"It's always best to talk about it, get together and find solutions," says Ms. Lefèvre.
The School Board of the Region of Sherbrooke (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Hotel-Dieu emergency
In the face of the overrun by a number of staff and trade unions over the past several months, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "decalate the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies that will not be able to intervene on 4 November".
An official request made "to not risk taking care of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of winter" but also aimed at not hindering the PS campaign a few months away from the municipal authorities.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective by that date.
Even if, at the APHP, the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" is preferred.
As of November 4, firefighters who provided approximately one quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency crossings at the Hotel-Dieu will all have been instructed to take 30 serious cases a day to the emergency of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hotel-Dieu, the emergency interns will leave Monday to five general medical interns.
As for the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The emergency reception service of the Hotel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th", assures without hindrance Loïc Capron, the president of the medical commission of establishment (CME) of the APHP, which supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," says Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in an emergency," he said, arguing the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will stay on site, he also assures.
But it is up to the SARS to decide to close the emergency reception service.
"Things are gradually being done," says Nicolas Péju, ARS spokesperson for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or we lied to him," says emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Dismissed from his position as Head of the SMUR in early July for leading the frown against the reorganization project, he defined himself as an "alert launcher" in the face of a "cynic" decision taken by "medical-administrative technology".
"They are emptying and asphyxiating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he believes.
For him, "if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they are regularly engorged.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours waiting in the Lariboisière emergency room.
At ARS, it is argued that 30 "dispatched" patients on several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will also have been strengthened.
The new hospital model launched since 7 October, which is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year, is being defended at the SARS as well as at the APHP.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners should also participate in the establishment of an "ambulatory care stay".
"Where do we go if people are asked to self-diagnose themselves," asks Gérald Kierzek for whom "the concept of a non-serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This is going to happen as for level 3 maternity.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best offer of care.
If the minister doesn't take action by Monday, we're going to change the armrest, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency physician and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP adviser from Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even though the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, again recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on 4 November.
If so, she would mark her net disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesperson.
Even if the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy on the merits, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to the other hospitals.
Obama Ends Listening to IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to put an end to her listening on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, says an American official on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to get back to the NSA listening case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time the IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal.
Asked about this, a US administration official replied: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance of the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
Expressing himself under the seal of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such monitoring had been established in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had given orders to stop these practices over the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the listenings of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of this information.
United Nations welcomes new goals for poverty reduction
The United Nations will now begin to work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in highlighting the "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to "extend national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These SDGs will build on progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my best to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Safety concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as conflicts between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, coughing them up, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to return; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes against a T-shirt bearing the mention "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on the square of the Independence of the capital Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by the Rhodesia governed by whites and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 billion in investments over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo reject each other's responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is responsible for the recent clashes and that it launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of the Renamo on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then degenerated when the government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman for the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for having triggered the conflict, and for accusing him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday, the French news agency, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that the Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness," said Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to calm tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
"They are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, an open university lecturer and expert in Mozambique.
None of them can negotiate well and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of the votes won by the Renamo has been falling ever since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to obtain more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is not known exactly what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has carried out disruptive flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would reiterate this threat.
Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
The instability has reinforced the frustrations of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the people responsible for the country's future are the government and the president, and that it is up to the president to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultane, a protestant, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "models of lifestyle," says the author.
Thor's Legend could show that " brutal force does not weigh against subtle ruse," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too violent, far too scandalous and, in some cases, too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland called for "a careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's great that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are "openly didactic" makes the children "get out completely", the messages being "sublimated" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or finished well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublime; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what we show and what we don't say.
One Hamas armed wing fighter was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources were learned in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they were shot by an Israeli armoury.
NSA Espionage: The United States is "going too far", admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in the area of espionage, acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first admission of Washington in full controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and their European allies, this is the first time that an American government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the NSA's interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant it to you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this no longer happens in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London in which he participated since Washington Thursday, October 31 by video link.
In his speech retransmitted, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified intelligence and information-gathering practices through the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention against possible attacks.
Calling for the attacks of 11 September 2001, the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since foiled numerous plans for attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered, because we were able to know ahead of these projects," the American diplomats' boss argued.
And, said John Kerry at the address of the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived".
But we're trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far inappropriately," said the Secretary of State, who had already had to speak about this international scandal on a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday evening that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was carrying out a review of these practices so that no one felt wrong".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites the documents obtained from the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the program called "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from optical fibers used by internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in the last January alone - ranging from metadata on emails, text items, audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google denied any connection to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA would have massively intercepted data and communications from US allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the US press claimed that the US President was unaware of such listenings, Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject, invoking national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the bullet to the European intelligence services who would have seized these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and this would not necessarily target Europe, said General Alexander.
And the controversy spread on Friday to Asia.
Indonesia has convened the Australian Ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by Americans as part of a vast international spying network that has also sparked China.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without its mastery, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces Ligue 1 club in a press release.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco in contrast to goals, released the list of players selected for this game on the 12th day, without including the 32-year-old attacker.
The press release simply states that it is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee when he returned from selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the dead cremated
Father Lachaise's crematorium organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the dead cremated in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the Paris City Hall, must attend, and will then explain, at a press conference, her proposals on funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a relative, it is the opposite: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book La Mort en cendres, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee on Funeral Ethics, insists on the "violence" of cremation, for the survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the loved body", which will be "reduced to a lot of ashes" in very little time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "elimination of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is accepted without pain in some Nordic and Protestant countries still ill lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Approve Death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to apprehension it.
Appreciating cremation is for François Michaud-Nérard, director general of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to plan for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as the one to which he would be entitled with a burial.
Ipsos' annual survey shows a strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their loved ones, whether religious (53%), or civil (24%).
From now on, 73% of those who have chosen a cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also desire it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For about ten years now, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the release of the ashes," says Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, who carry out, in the presence of the body, the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to appoint the deceased, to connect him to others, to evoke it, to give meaning to his death, to organize the farewell.
This has been the case at Father Lachaise's crematorium since 1998.
Ceremonial masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It was in this context that Father Lachaise's crematorium organized, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which he invited the families of the people who were crematized in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, to the attention of those who could not make the trip.
Crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, rehousing for rats turns to controversy
At the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the Director of the Southern Lands Habitat Office proposed, on an exceptional and temporary basis, to relocate the couple and its three children in a new T4.
Yet the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has gone too far, says Joël Canapa, the Director of the Office.
Rats, there's always been one in the cities.
The deratification company carries out two passages a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every demand of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not jump into the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratification products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, a child will not be killed.
"We didn't invite the rats to our house," defends the family father who left his accommodation to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without the money and we expect a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ends down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended in decline on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, prejudicial to export values and the warning of its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix yielded 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony dropped from over 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house full of flames in Old Quebec
A fire that started on Friday noon in Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than 30 firefighters were sent to 9 Hébert Street.
The flames were declared in a house of three dwellings spread over four floors behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, who were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw some apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms succeeded, because it took some reinforcement to attack the building, because it is buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, spokesman for the firefighters of Quebec.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, Vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the public, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it has been retaken more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most poster heads emerged in the Carolines, and were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival in order to continue working with them.
This year's event will feature the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for veterans, organized at Madison Square Garden, which will include Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, as has the world of comedy.
Several of the actors participating in this year's festival have gone through non-traditional circuits, for example presenting shows on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of fantasy football joyfully lascif of the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" show and was part of the casting of the "Parks and Recreation" series, but she is still better known for her series of viral videos "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors with a singular voice (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up actor, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at the City Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he was going down a alley between two buildings and he said, well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here.
Oil price continues to fall and approaches $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to decline on Friday, while concerns about the size of stocks offset a report showing that the Chinese electricity industry is strengthening.
The price of U.S. crude for delivery in December fell from $14 cents to $96.24 per barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a decrease of 5.8% for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy indicated Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show an increase in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude Brent, a reference for the international crude already used by American refineries, lost 26 cents to drop to $108.58 per barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Question of the right to abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal reinstated certain restrictions on the right of voluntary termination of pregnancy in Texas, which had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State and largely calling into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The Court of Appeal ruling means that doctors who practice GIVs will have to have a "privilege of admission" from local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a physician, under his or her status as a caregiver of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment.
IMG advocates argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of a third of the state's clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "privilege of admission" for their practitioners.
A total of nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a judge of first instance had found on the day before the law came into force that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is in charge of the governorship, has asked the Court of Appeal to quash the judgment of first instance that was blocking the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has succeeded in a strong turnaround, hearing side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% of audience share.
But was the show on your date?
Some 10,000 candidates presented themselves at the hearings of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the perch André Manukian and Olivier Bass.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored on this first bonus.
As every year, the first audition shows stir up a wide selection of grass singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Now, on Twitter, we want entertainment, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some found their account there.
Many have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone to the end.
Behind the television screens, the successful singer vocations are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to laugh.
Court blocks decision on NYPD's control and search policy
A federal court of appeal blocked the decision of a judge demanding changes in the New York Police Department's control and search program and detested it.
The United States Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the end of the city's appeal.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed its findings and remedial orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the application for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge had to be disproved because it violated the code of conduct of the judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements in which it reacted publicly to the Court's criticisms.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by mistargeting black men and Hispanic men as part of their monitoring and search program.
She appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras placed on the body in the districts where the greatest number of controls take place.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of persons whose case is rejected after police control.
The City's appeal hearing is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has existed for decades in a certain form, but the number of controls recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls that concerned mainly black men and Hispanic men.
Judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
Supporters advocating changes in the NYPD's control and search program say that they will put an end to unfair practices, make police forces more effective and trusted, and can change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime, represent a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of pressure police forces after police personnel have been severely reduced over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to the constitutional control and search practices, but that it was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
The tenants must vote because each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the property that goes in taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each accommodation.
We are forced to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay for fireworks at $100,000, lands of $4 to $5 million in case...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say it's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entered the 500 m2 of Elyséen cuisine as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all levels until he became chief nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande, passing through Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their vacation places, and fed an incalculable number of greats of this world in a quasi-anonymous that he only breaks today, at retirement time, at 60 years.
The man with an open face, undressed skull and glasses of intellectual, born on 24 October 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin holds a pastry CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I have passed from one castle to another!", ironically Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents for whom he has officialized, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of the state or his companion or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen", to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
Don't bother with heads of state who showed relative indifference to land foods, "they're all gourmets," kindly denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a little more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who loves to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like".
The current head of state, who regained the lost pounds before the presidential campaign, has "no demand for specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during state dinners in the Elysée: we must serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there were mistakes.
The now former chef of the Elysée cuisine, who had a drink Tuesday night with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart."François Hollande came to greet me".
He said praise.
"His human side is out," he says.
The chief will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been in Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of the flames in Old Quebec on Friday noon.
The four-bedroom building, located on 15 Hébert Street, was alarmed by three fire department alarms.
The fire came forward, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesman for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The burning house housed four houses, but no tenant was at the scene at the time of the fire.
The damage was limited, even though the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sappers have ruled out the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wall Street Wolf: Exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets escape some images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is embodied by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio is going to debrief you in his role as a lazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "Long Island Stock Exchange Broker, who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a vast corruption case on Wall Street."
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then set up a scam that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascension, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, man chains parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excesses in all kinds are the main words of this crazy story.
The couple Scorsese-DiCaprio seems to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long assembly.
Looks like the movie finally lasts 2:45.
In the room on December 25, he will be able to participate in the oscar race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
The former editor of News of the World Andy Coulson reportedly used "telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a bidon pipe on a link involving the then-exercise Minister of the Interior, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC testified before the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "pretty special advisor."
It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack Pawlby's voice box and to "plant permanently in front of his door", but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr.Coulson, who is now NotW's editor-in-chief, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people's house hoping to surprise them, it's the kind of man to love presenting history to people to see what they say," said Edis.
He stated that NotW used three means to investigate issues: telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, monitoring, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Did he know about the phone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say, "Of course I do."
Rumours about a Clarke liaison were first repeated by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said that she had been told: "Do not waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which pirated voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
The investigators also found seizures on the private detective's computer that concerned Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a project file.
During the period when the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking them for information about her, added Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's minor actions.
In a voice message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he himself attended co-defender Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted that they had carried out telephone hacking.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister in the midst of violence
The U.S. President was due to receive Friday, November 1, 2013, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, seeking help from the United States to fight the largest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced in October its most murderous month in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday 1 November by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations has an even higher record of 979 deaths and 1,902 injuries.
These violences are increasingly deadly despite enhanced security measures and large-scale military operations launched by the government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by Shia.
The total number of deaths in October has been highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence causes fear of a new embrace while neighbouring Syria is in the midst of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing dissatisfaction of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being marginalized politically and being the target of unjust arrests, has fuelled this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is at the heart of the talks in the United States by Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the American President, elected on the promise to put an end to the military commitment in that country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival on Wednesday in Washington, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the elected members of Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to conduct a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, giving him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence through his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "the pernicious influence of Iran in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing accuses a Uighor group of Tiananmen's attack
China's Homeland Security Chief accused on Friday a group of Uighurs separatists from Xinjiang of being behind the car bombing that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, darkened on the crowd that was on the famous Chinese capital square, symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Office in charge of internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement of East Turkestan of instigating this attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority based in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there driven by independentist demands.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing has been organized and premeditated," Meng said to the Hong Kong channel Phoenix TV.
"The group that stood behind was the Islamic movement of East Turkestan," he added, with his remarks being taken over by the new China agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he was of Ouighoure origin and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic movement of East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican probes contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey around the world on how parishes manage sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with the instruction to obtain as many answers as possible.
The information will serve an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesman for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide in the appropriate way to probe the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the Internet survey asking Catholics to participate.
Democratic Republic of the Congo: The Army Attacks the Last Fif of the Rebels
The irreducibles of the M23, a few hundred combatants, were cut off at about 2000 metres above the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and Jomba, two localities about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
"It has not stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," told AFP a Jomba resident, joined by telephone at around 12:30, and according to which a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed the rebels a little."
According to this witness who wanted to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before going to the front for a "straightening operation".
We heard very clearly behind him crepitations fed by small arms.
From Bunagana, the political fief and last strong place of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, a journalist from the AFP could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fighting entered "in a final phase", the FARDC having "encircled the residual M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since the resumption on Friday of clashes between the Movement of 23 March (M23) and the army, the Monusco does not participate directly in the fighting, but it provides government troops with decisive support in terms of intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, dozens of soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, went up towards the front line.
They were armed with kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, border post with Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to take over another aircraft piling M23's positions on the hills.
The Congolese President, Joseph Kabila, again called on Wednesday evening the rebels to "demobilize themselves voluntarily" under pain of being disarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and M23 have been arguing since December with no result at this time.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have concluded the talks, only Ugandan mediation remains to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side.
The M23 was born of a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its sub-soil is filled with conveited mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where some 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday according to the United Nations, the movement of return to the DRC that started in the morning reversed in the middle of the day.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the military told us to go back," said AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back.
It's like shootings are getting closer to people.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, this stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the singing and dancing productions take flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally found its voice.
It's a revolution: the French musical stands out as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart, the rock opera, most of the attempts stopped in the ridiculous.
And the successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables wore the aureole of mystery.
Jean-Luc Choplin's arrival at the Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador has changed his mind.
Today, these two scenes handle titles like successful tubes.
The first one takes over this Christmas, her excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following world creation of "Un American à Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle et la Bête" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other scenes, musical performances such as "1789", "Bastille lovers" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" set themselves at the height of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Historys of musicals" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard conquered.
How do French musicals evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
There are first the "musical spectacles" that evolve according to the wishes of the producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a fifteen-year leap backwards under the pretext that we can serve about anything when we have Matt Pokora in the lead.
After that, we have musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" or "The Awakening of Spring" have difficulty being funded.
Do we have enough capable artists like Broadway singer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it is a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who are turning projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of musicals is very different.
Young people are trained in these occupations in many schools.
Jobs are numerous among regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The talent pool is as consistent as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often from boulevard theatre for adults and not for young adults.
Music shows fill this gap.
It's these same young people who love reality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of the enthusiasm of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are wisely kept by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a provincial Zenith.
The mayonnaise is raised in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major cinemas in France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injured in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning at around 5:30 a.m., on the inner ring of Brussels up to Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is free of it.
The ring was closed to traffic, until 9:00 a.m., at the scene of the accident, as long as the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause traffic jams as the accident occurred at the Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be diverted by this exit/entry of the ring.
A seriously injured child in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old was seriously injured as a result of an accident at an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: Army Prepares New Assault · Global Voices
Children play on a charred armory belonging to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing on Friday for a new assault on the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The objective is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks the hill of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on his own.
He'll only stay on Runyonyi Hill.
"Celle de Chanzu is not very strategic," said AFP Governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and last strong seat of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred unreducibles of the M23 have been cut off at nearly 2,000 metres above the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close fighting on Thursday throughout the day indicated that the situation had been "quiet since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting of the day before and were buried.
One girl was shot, and three others were wounded, including a serious evacuation by FARDC, added this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the resumption of the fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have given no record of loss of life.
The NSA's revelations increase business paranoia with respect to state surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter overflew the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American forepost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation generated an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, the Director of U.S. Intelligence, reiterated in September that the U.S. does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal industrial secrets from foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became a whistleblower, began to reveal his inexhaustible wealth of information about the secrets of US surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director by word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spyed on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. storage service providers in the Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever aroused the paranoia of companies with regard to state surveillance.
The revelation that the German chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that caused the vase to overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that this data should be used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, President of BITEMI, who represents German IT SMEs.
German companies believe that the United States is as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to an investigation published in July by the EY consulting firm.
However, in all the documents unveiled by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A Member of the German Parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them...
"This is not the right way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German company software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn't let her die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
However, the scale and sophistication of the American spy agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations was a shock to some companies who even thought that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing since European officials have become aware that data stored in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10% of non-American members have renounced their plans to use an American cloud storage service provider after disclosures on the American Prism data exploration program.
Jim Snabe, SAP's co-director, says: "Our customers are asking us a question today that they weren't asking us a year ago: where are my data kept and can you assure me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders say that the latest reports are merely a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been one.
"It's been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, CEO of the BASF chemical company.
The Americans spy on us commercially and industrially, just as we spy on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, in case this would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long beaten the message that it is for the least imprudent to recover a free USB flash drive in a professional lounge or to leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the board of directors of the automobile manufacturer Audi, states that the collection of mobile phones before board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The German BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on their trips abroad due to the risk of infringing the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access," warns BfV in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to the economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Estimated Intelligence (NIE) carried out by the United States in February cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, who were second-degree perpetrators of acts of economic intelligence piracy, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, "French people are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former French Director of Internal Intelligence, DCIRI, said in an interview this month: "Services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, think that their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, whose body was found in a combat carpet rolled into the gymnasium of his high school, think that their son was murdered, said the family lawyer Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 stuck in a rug standing behind the ranks of his high school gymnasium.
The investigators of the County Sheriff of Lowndes concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family challenges these findings.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, counsel representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
"They think it challenges all logic, the laws of physics and common sense," added Crump.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person(s) responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a card and they were returned to a death bag," he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated Johnson had died by "positional asphyxiation."
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"A number of questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he updates elements that would justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the sheriff's office in Lowndes County was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to hand over all the video surveillance footage that the investigators had examined.
The adolescent's parents said they hoped that the video images contained clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC issues advice on child allergies to schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines published by the US government, since the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States are currently suffering from food allergies.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies in children, and how to treat them in case of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the most commonly used EpiPen brand self-injector – to be able to react quickly to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The legislative assemblies of States have recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more readily available epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I feel like something bites my tongue," "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue," or "I have tingling on my tongue."
The NSA case highlights the total lack of debate on intelligence
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand stumbles in public by convoking the Ambassador of the United States on 21 October, and on the other hand prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumor of the presence on board Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the world a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the listenings of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't there be a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we consider that, in view of American power, this is an important light.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to indignant us of this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American collaboration?
The introduction for nearly ten years of very powerful interception technology tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States, in particular, have put in place procedures for cooperation and the exchange of almost daily information, which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, Mohammed Merah's presence in tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA's means.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to US services, and, in return - it has already been said quickly - Americans can give information to French about other regions of the world.
So the substantive issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to have interception tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, especially in Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and, ultimately, the issue of violations of freedoms.
What is the real risk for the United States of America?
I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk faced by Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been tense.
Another effect may be more cost-effective: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in the light of revelations, to entrust their confidential data to U.S. providers subject to U.S. laws, and thus to the control of the NSA.
Last: the vast movement of revelations launched by media around the world, which contributes to a debate on intelligence surveillance practices up to now almost non-existent, could prompt legislators, including Americans, to reconsider their powers to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children may choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be attributed to them rigidly at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to report the sex of their child, allowing them to enter an "indeterminate" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions about sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersexual persons.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors created, contusionated and balming.
It is estimated that a child in 2,000 born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexed, the intersexuality being part of the group of 60 diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term for people with abnormally developed chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles).
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to attribute it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, psychiatrist in New York and sex identification specialist, said that the new German law "looks like a good idea."
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case with most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation, and see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersexed persons as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is in general both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), primary sexual characters (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in employment, as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young non-compliant boys now have camps that are specially designed for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to include male, female or "third sex" in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal trial that allowed her to keep a sex "unspecified" for life.
The German passports will have a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this land-based Catholic country signed a petition to remove the "gender theory" from school books.
The American Catholic Online site also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one of them, two other pillars of civilization are overthrown."
In Maryland, an infant's mother also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at birth.
"The parent role is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's sex," she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And barely a dozen years ago, the medical community considered the genre to be a slate, which one can erase and on which one can redesign.
But now, many are questioning the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may be mistaken, not knowing how a child will feel about sexual reassignment when he or she grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money, Johns-Hopkins University, who considered gender to be malleable.
He enshrined the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/John", his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a small boy whose penis had been cut in a barren circumcision to have him castrated entirely, also removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn't," Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "still repeat this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say "[that] they are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors could not really say whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he underwent vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical file.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to allow his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
Surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which is trying to normalize the perception of intersexed people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Director General of the California-based non-profit organization Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that the German law "invites labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child an "indeterminate" sex," she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to attribute a male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that his organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized as third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal genre," she added.
The German law concerns the attribution of sex to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should wage at that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is suffering from a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law "will hold" parents and children responsible.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called a complete androgenic insensitivity syndrome.
Because of the failure of her androgenic receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, 29 years old, Katie is married and interned in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or foster mothers.
"The law leaves a certain latitude to parents so that they don't have to make early decisions," Baratz said.
This leaves them time to do some tests and understand them, and a delay before registering "male" or "female".
Thus, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love it.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy being a parent.
You don't have to rush into surgery that's irreversible.
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and mitigates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and this is something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta trusting in the longevity of her government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right within the coalition in power as the Senate vote approaches to defeat Silvio Berlusconi's mandate.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the left centre leader says he "closely intends" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper chamber of the Italian Parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide the fate of the former President of the Council condemned for tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support to the government if the Senate, where it has more opponents than supporters, pronounces its dismissal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Liberty (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on 2 October last his refusal to surrender to the Berlusconi injunctions that already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of shots.
Firefighters called at the scene said they responded to a call for "multiple injuries".
"The law enforcement forces are on the spot," says the airport on its Twitter account, while television footage showed people evacuated to ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) told AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated to a stretcher, and a second one transported to a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 a.m. local (12:30 a.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that Bullets 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman was unable to confirm immediately whether one of his employees was injured.
All flights upon arrival and departure from the airport have been suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza-sces
Israeli tank fire killed a Palestinian Islamist Hamas activist on Thursday and seriously injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip, and it was learned from sources of health services.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in this area, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your firing of Palestinian mortars.
The Israeli army simply referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered as dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisors considered, in the utmost secrecy, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most striking event in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited 2012 campaign book, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and reported on Thursday evening that the president's close collaborators had carried out "in-depth group work and surveys at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's escape could help Obama with his re-election as his hopes were diminishing.
According to the political correspondent of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of the campaign leaders and the White House, namely the former Secretary General of the White House Bill Daley, aimed at measuring the effect of the replacement of the Vice-President by former Secretary of State Clinton on the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely kept within the Chicago campaign HQ and within the oval office.
Only half a dozen close advisors to the president – including Daley, Obama's former campaign leader Jim Messina and former advisors at the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties", before finally deciding against change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said I'd been looking at a whole series of questions, and it was one of them," Daley said in the paper.
Do you remember that at that time the president was not in shape, and so we said, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified the exam as "agreed," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial during the election.
"The campaigns don't spend much money on polls and focus groups unless they seriously consider taking action," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was reviewing the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss then was aware of any change.
Although Daley said that he did not think that the president "was aware" of the possible change, the former Secretary General admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not definitively answer the question of whether the political polls had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's escape from the presidential list was being examined.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
Do you want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world's first medusa-based fluorescent ice.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", said: "This is something incredible but we're still at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about £200."
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to shine.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed opportune to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've ever created because the light of the jellyfish is worth four times as much as gold.
Each ball costs me about £140.
But she tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimental approach, based in Bristol, is known for his unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: "I would really like to develop an invisible ice."
It's inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to do it.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, revealed Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for the residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, as he looked at the trees and carried out the famous 21st movement of tai chi, with his hands as a musician who broke the air," says Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explained that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their house in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we are city dwellers, it is our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the great joy of living he had," she adds.
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and disguise ourselves to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more lazy.
Over the past two years, I haven't distributed a single candy and I certainly won't do it any more this year.
But the states show that I'm the Welsh sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is trends.
The disguises are expected to represent $1.2 million out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men in Daft Punk's space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no trouble remaining traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my amazement, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million in animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs disguised as hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't simmer.
Americans are going to spend $1.9 million in candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, soucets, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go hunting candy in their neighborhood, according to the US Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, we don't tell each other stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing we don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Manufacturers Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to elucidate yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 haunted houses officially recognized in the United States, which generate about $500 million of recipes, according to America Haunts, and this includes these wonderful photos of you pissing on yourself that your friends put on Facebook and that you can't remove and on which a guy you like leaves a comment of the "looking head" style.
Well, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to La Grosse Citrouille when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped pumpkin is like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the "baby-citruille trend" only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pots and didn't have to sit in them.
This year, Americans will spend approximately $106 million in pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lantern pumpkins that slowly flirt on the porch of your house probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you're looking to get more noticed, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try sculpting their 922 kg pumpkin.
Royal Bank of Scotland will set up an internal defecation structure ("bad bank") of £38 billion (€45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relations with London and accelerate its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it up within three years.
RBS also stated that it would include a provision for depreciation of additional dubious receivables of £4 to £4.5 billion over the quarter, a writing related to the formation of the cantonment structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would release from 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thus strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London pointed out that the "bad bank" would take a look at the past, with the government being specifically accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a large bank for customers and the UK," said the new CEO Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior has 6-point coat seats and harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, Chief Executive Officer of Bowler Motorsport said: "The rally fans who join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some seek excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try out different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigours and realities of rallying raids.
We've had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is really going to be exciting."
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the possibility of participating in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above ground on an unstable cornice in a career
Ruby, a spagul cocker, had escaped after an accident of the road without gravity
She was spotted three days later by a person who was walking her dog stuck in the career.
Firefighters came down in a reminder along the cliff to get the bitch back and save her from a certain death.
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after the firefighters were called to recover it safely while it was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable hillside of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker wreck, escaped after an accident on the road on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career on Wednesday.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost bitch and launched a call on social media sites after she disappeared in the career following an unserious accident.
At 14:15 on Wednesday, a person with a sharp view walking his dog spotted Ruby on a corner in the quarry, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team at the Cleckheaton fire station crashed into the scene and went down in a reminder to save Ruby by using an animal tank to transport it to the top of the cliff.
Technical relief specialist Andy Clayton said: "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely did not move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies later.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical relief specialist Peter Lau said: " Ruby was very lucky to get away with it."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for control; her general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified watching the rescue."
I didn't think she was up there first.
It was surprising to have him back in his arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were great.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely great.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid that she would fall but she did not move."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never fucked Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "he fucked me when I was 18."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger said that he "clearly denies having made advances to Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Perhaps she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers making an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", appeared in the first place of the charts this week.
Beijing is calling into question an Islamic Turkmen movement
"Backstage support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," said the Chinese security organ boss to a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on a website on Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), spoke in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization after the attack on Monday.
According to the Chinese police, three Ouighurs of the same family in the Xinjiang Muslim-dominant region, bordering several countries in Central Asia, rushed their car loaded with gasoline cans against the entry of the Forbidden City into Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two and injured 40.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which claims to be fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, formerly the Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: Europe's Breakdown Gives the Scots the Choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Trade Area in order to be able to join the EU.
And here we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wires along the wall of Hadrian.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and that was to be expected).
Nor did anyone say that EU Member States spend much of their time circumventing their formal rules when they are arranged.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continued non-compliance with the rules would be a fine concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to obtain from the Scots.
So it's a story that's not one of them.
And a story so old that it is now frozen: I heard for the first time the bobard that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
Yet, we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why exchange the yoke of London against that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at a dead end.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, the parties that oppose the EU or campaign to abandon the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptic Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the September federal elections and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the proposed creation of a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has been a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the carcase weighing on national economies through the accession to the single currency, has led many people to believe that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments with excessive budget deficits – it was only true for Greece.
Rather, the European system has placed on its members exchange rates favourable to German exporters – what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe are faced with an intrinsic problem of productivity vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
In addition to the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper lack of awareness of productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidise French and German energy companies at consumer's expense – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a wasteful disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage freezes around the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalised by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt grumbles, particularly in France, one of the EU's major leaders.
After the war, the French political elite regarded the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy ill-fated.
Result: the far-right party of Marine Le Pen, the National Anti-European Front, has just won a crucial by-election, sending socialists to power in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot start from the principle that a split of the right will automatically favour the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with his new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single and anti-European anti-currency bloc within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are right in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
That is what I think: very soon, Europe's unique anti-European and anti-currency sentiment will unify and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will come back to something that will look more like the "Europe of the Nations (Southern)" free privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to take its distance from this project, and I hope it will look soft in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a small England region (mainly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels for a walk.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a more free European agreement on the condition that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a Europe of non-federal nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is – and this is to be noted – the anti-austerity political movement that has been the most successful in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Chesser, Alistair Darling, and the Conservative/liberal-Democrat coalition that followed.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Ageing earlier
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not so pronounced among boys
CNN's former correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and health issues in children.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter's pubic breasts and hair begin to grow at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid change towards full puberty," said Kaplowitz.
The obvious signs of development, such as the budding of the breasts, the hair under the arms and in the pubic area and the body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12 and a half years, while it was 12 years three quarters in 1970.
"Once the chest has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test for how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual emergence of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
Faster evolution can justify tests performed by an endocrinologist to remove serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature aging of bones that can slow growth and a small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for medicinal and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs but recognizes that "controlling puberty can alleviate certain behavioural problems and the sensation for girls to be different from others".
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way they will deal with hygiene issues," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first 10-year-old rules.
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came back from the frightened and upset school to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public's attention about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or the sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz states that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 that linked the percentage of fat in the onset of puberty.
Other discoveries support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything, from economic to climate, to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on the face and in the pubic area younger, the trend towards genuine early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians attending the PAA conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatrician working at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early must be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The tribute to the folk of the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and folk music that just began to resonate before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the French Cinematheque, had taken over the Palme d'Or in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their devolution on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs played live, Oscar Isaac turns out to be a accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious retirement.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich tricks in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less bright clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the juror delivered to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells a week about the tribulations of a folk singer who fails to pierce and gets angry with the whole earth.
He accepts back the replacements at the foot raised in the studios.
Without accommodation, he makes the tour of the sofas of his friends who still want to receive it.
An air of documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what was of interest to us: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not career-oriented but integrated, with self-destructive behavior," said Ethan Coen to the press, crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and prizes in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music filmmakers built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the arrival of Greenwich village, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk, wrote.
The film then looks like a documentary, from the 33T-invasive dusty music label that was blinded by an impassable old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and to the cafes where the singers were performing.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by integrating a funny character who goes through the film all the time: a beautiful red cat with a cracking look, a fortune companion of Llewyn Davis.
Asked about the way he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled having "great in Tennessee, bathed by blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is necessary to "be regarded as good", "random can also launch someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to let ourselves be caught by all that can prevent us from expressing ourselves".
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", died.
He never knew the word "retirement."
Phenomena of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times had consecrated him as "the author of spy novels who knew too much."
He had spent ten days in Afghanistan, the 198th and 199th Opus theatre of the famous series of spy novels.
Physically diminished by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was travelling on this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he also left for Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, ensured to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"No doubt between 120 and 150 million all countries," he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment of a building on Foch Avenue just steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which SAS adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not counting pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the low table between the bronzes or ivorys reported from the 130 countries surveyed to locate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous chest, carrying a pistol or assault rifle.
Inside, his most serene highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, an Austrian aristocrat who was dissergized and a contract agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs of the family castle, launched himself into the kits of all the wicked people of the earth, communists of the 1970s and 1980s, then jihadists from the 1990s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitical and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never had the claim to be a literary author," said Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people I don't send a message to.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, like Albert London, who went to the scene and came back with real, long-term investigations."
SAS's father said "make some kind of geopolitical sheet."
"I am always my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," said Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including AFP journalists, diplomats, people of services I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitoring: thus, a month before the attack of a command center of the Syrian regime, having killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Path of Damascus".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he had been the first to reveal the existence of a CIA secret command centre in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadad in "The Cairo Conspiracy", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique à Bamako", he reported the columns of 4X4 of jihadists based on the Malian capital.
I am not a devinity, was defending Gérard de Villiers, I simply make assumptions from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my hypotheses come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 Marguerite IBM typewriter "whose pieces were changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
On the walls of his office are hung AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photographs of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machoism by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always well received in Africa where I count many readers.
Gérard de Villiers said: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old."
He won't die and he won't retire.
No more than I do.
Airplanes complain about the width of the seats while large controls are at play
The dispute rages between the great aeronautical manufacturers about the width of the tourist class's seats on long-haul flights, opening the way to bitter confrontation at the Dubai aeronautics fair that takes place this month.
The conflict concerns the width of the seats offered on long-haul flights to economic class passengers – which are not always the most courteous by airlines, but to which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing states that it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as the aircraftmen sought to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, possibly hoping for a record of orders at the event to take place from November 17 to 21.
The way in which the seats will be placed at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing states that its "777X" renovated will be able to accommodate 406 people in economic class in seats of more than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in economic class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X should take the step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were able to realize recently what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financials of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept this?"
"Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft," said John Leahy, commercial director of Airbus.
As eating habits change, people grow, but seats in planes have not radically changed.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American weight from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American tower size of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival clings to a seat concept dating back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly named "jet set" device was narrower.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study that indicated that an additional thumb at the width of the seats would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus's figures regarding the width of seats and states that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that the cabin experience does not depend only on the width of the seats.
"It's really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of Boeing's passenger satisfaction.
They don't want to be told what will allow them to be profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute lies a flight-order race of at least $700 million at market prices in the coming decades, sufficient to bring the balance of US and European exports to a close.
As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a performance per seat in their latest long-haul two-engine models 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing does this to be able to house more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, director of Comfort Passenger at the European Airbus aircraft operator.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers opt for a more dense configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper rates.
"A seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus's proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777," said the insider expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Aircraft vendors who tour the world even take a meter with them to check the competing configurations.
While offering comfortable devices, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater customization of cabins by offering wider side seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern devices, experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aeronautical industry in order to set up a size standard for the finished seats, but that he could forget the sales wave of 777X.
Oracle's Shareholders Irritated by Ellison's Wage
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted against the compensation proposal for founder and CEO Larry Ellison on Thursday in view of the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just aurolated by the victory of his boat at the America Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had had a negative vote on his remuneration.
Oracle's boss gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year closed in May due to the group's poor performance, which missed its growth goals, but received about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is just a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire year 2013, Oracle's net profit increased by 3.5% while the stock exchange price increased by 27.5%, overperforming the S&P-500 index which took 24% at the same time.
The new nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine dependence for life.
Other tests are needed before starting trials on the human being, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods now available on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track all nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents smokers from having their nicotine dose.
In tests, vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued their normal activity.
But mice who had not been vaccinated "were calm," researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections should be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remain high that they are too expensive and unpractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms liver cells into antibody plants.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not take pleasure in it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it will help them lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but reported that much more research was needed.
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a strike by an American drone in Pakistan on Friday.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been announced several times already in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in this strike, conducted in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security officer.
The previous day, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, travelling to London, informed the British government that discussions had begun with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the State Anti-Corruption Regulator.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied having changed the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had put pressure on several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid had two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiry in August 2005, without any invitation to tender.
She now investigates allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former Assistant Secretary General, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pressured the leases to be tendered.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay's businesses, which accounted for approximately $2.5 million a year, were renewed without a call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of calls for tenders.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, admitted Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ministry of the Ports after working under the orders of Mr. Obeid at the Ministry of Fisheries.
"Is the subject discussed during these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheaty to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but anyway, it wasn't that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, says a leader
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port town of Latakia Thursday night, confirms a military official to Fox News.
The official did not specify the target, but said there was at least one target.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel conducted air strikes against missile cargoes in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a "authenticity" test
The government is currently exploring the possibility of introducing a "authenticity test" for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while considering extending enforcement measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unskilled positions or as a diversion to bring their family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today when Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's discourse on foreign workers, saying he could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The failed statements about "foreigners returning to the end of the line" and "jobs for Australians first" are an unpleasant return at the time when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market," she said at the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historic artifact.
The working paper describes the 12 measures previously envisaged by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for "if the job offer is genuine in case the applicant is a personal relationship or partner of the owner or person concerned within the sponsoring undertaking".
Companies could also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker would have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum-seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The angry son of the 9-year-old man went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was transferred urgently by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British Government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and Northern England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer stated that the project "would bring the United Kingdom together".
The Scottish Minister of Transport, Keith Brown, said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from 32.7 Mb£ to 42.6 Mb£.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of journey times for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of not more than three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."
We push the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a problem of capacity of our railway network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight to the overall high-speed rail network project throughout Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British government to examine options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edimbourg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and we will decide together on the next steps."
Rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force for the time being in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the US move to loosen regulation of electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers for a change of procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can already do so for most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that requires U.S. carriers to perform significant work to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft by air," she said.
The issue is subject to regulation which requires aircraft operators to ensure the continued maintenance of safety and passengers to comply with the safety instructions issued by crew members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to CASA about her intention to extend the use of her entertainment system on board using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a revision of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the entertainment system on board using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft," said one spokesperson.
Qantas said she was respecting the current rules for the time being.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change that immediately," she said.
The FAA decision applies to American airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA's decision and its reasons.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, hand baggage transportation programs and passenger instructions.
"As soon as an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely placed under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: At least four wounded in a violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a gathering of about 30 people according to the testimonies gathered...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a rix involving several people broke out on the side of the Post.
At least four minor injuries would be deplorable.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore's pledge lenders take advantage of the middle classes forced to tighten the belt
Janani Amirthalinga presents a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay for the tuition fees of her daughters at a pawn shop at the Bendemeer Shopping Centre in Singapore.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt increases – that ValueMax, where it has made its transaction, has become the third-largest loan company to be introduced to the Singapore stock exchange this week.
Taking jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it's almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's pledge lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same mall.
However, pledge lenders have the advantage of not applying for solvency or proof of salary checks, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to lenders on pledge while families feel the pressure of increasing the cost of living and over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and the low-cost credit fueled by too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to pledge lenders to bridge the gap while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency cited the growing debt of households, resulting mainly from the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia ranks at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, while this rate stood at 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which recently emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance sheet is that with the increase in costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the salary scale] are looking to complete their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have made people rush to put their personal belongings to the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items put into pledge in the 200 loan stores on pledge from the city-state are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's put the chain in Grandma's gold and we'll get it back next month."
In Thailand, EasyMoney, Thailand's largest provider of retail loans, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores over the past few months.
The increase is such in the lending sector that ValueMax, operator of the shop in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this one in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its CEO.
The company will fund them using 60% of Singapore's $66 million raised this week during its introduction to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have been critical of the exorbitant interest rates they are practicing, Ms. Yeah indicates that gambling offers not only lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Customers mortgage property they already own, and monetizing their personal property does not increase household debt," she says.
It is becoming more and more socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed financing in the short term.
People who go to lenders on pledge are also not only those who have financial problems.
The wealthy people of Singapore also go to the ValueMax loan shops to put gold ingots or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see clients from all layers of society.
"They may be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments, or small businesses that have cash needs to go through a difficult course," said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia
A youth pastor in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is charged with child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor was attending, is deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and must not access the Internet.
He will appear in the provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being kicked out of it.
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barred from a brassard with the gammed cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the management of the establishment that called the police, said the store Friday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," said a spokesman for the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "as soon as it arrived, it had already gone unspeakable," she added.
I was in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were mouthwashed.
"You don't go out that way on the street unless you want to draw attention," said a client, Rosina Rusin, 60, at Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween Day, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing an SS black armband twice a week for three years at Asda," said Paul Dutton, explaining "mental problems."
$325 million rescue plan for the Tasmania Health System
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout plan for the vacillating health system has strict conditions to ensure that the government of the state will not waste the funds.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking "emergency measures" to put an end to a crisis caused by the aging population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The four-year funding was decided after government consultations with Tasmania's independent MP, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-emergency surgical operations.
2,600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopaedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch up with the delay.
Funding is also provided for unscheduled clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training of medical staff, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to frontline clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania's health care system," said Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Tasmania government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will have to maintain current funding levels to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on the areas where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient manner possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much "unless they are followed by a real reform to consolidate Tasmania's public health system."
However, he congratulated the government for having responded to his request for urgent assistance to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will contribute greatly to removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-emergency procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesperson Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is "a solution of fortune."
"The reason we're here is that the state labor government has withdrawn $430 million from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
You can't have a government of the state that takes out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts $300 million, and pretends it's a busy day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel is marked by a remarkable artistic direction and a thorough reconstruction of the period, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Running in France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocracy sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the unceasing cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Superior Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pays in lubricity or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of narration could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, says the surveillance agency
Syria destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, said the international chemical weapons monitoring body on Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also said Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived one day in advance of the deadline for the
1 November by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or "make unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the phase of initial destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made as the fighting raged on Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights based in Britain.
The group of activists, following the evolution of the human balance through a network of militants based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bashar al-Assad were killed, 18,678 of whom were combatants of the pro-government forces and 187 of the militants of Lebanese Hezbollah.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 were opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated this figure since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
El Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to groups in the Al Qaeda network, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not give any precision.
The fighting stressed the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors while completing their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a continuing civil war, within tight deadlines.
A statement by the OPCW, working closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was "now satisfied with having controlled – and seen destroyed – all declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling."
She added that "no other inspection activities were planned for the time being."
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first phase of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the Inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons which was approved by the OPCW Executive Committee the following month.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage that you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of the organization Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of el-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by the members of the sect of Alawites, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory said that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Colour caused by the sentence imposed against one of Bali's bombers
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence imposed against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used during the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass killing for attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also convicted of many other charges related to terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have applied for life imprisonment, yet they could have asked that the man, called "Demolution Man" for his reputation as an expert in bomb manufacturing, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she stated that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have taken the same path as the other men.
"He should be dragged in front of the execution platoon," said Ms. Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without having any other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 11:00 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he "death" three times while on respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues stated that Patek should have known the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhras and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others, it's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the American forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with Bin Laden in order to restore links between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He did not surrender," added Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he laughed at the loss of grief he had been able to cause to others.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Ms. Corteen.
Patek may, however, appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airlines passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phone – under the new highly anticipated directives issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the crew training manuals and the rules for the storage of aircraft to be in compliance.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"According to the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon," said the FAA in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft's doors are closed.
They are not supposed to light them again until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives its green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft on the plane's descent before landing and not turn them on until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground rolling, the FAA said.
Most new line aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Expectants, said she was happy with these changes.
"Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with the carriers to do so – it will benefit everyone," Glading explained in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room overseers" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in aircraft mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was expelled loudly from an American Airlines aircraft after refusing to turn off his device while the aircraft was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, stated that mobile phones were always considered to pose a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could eventually create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if they are used on board," said Rosenker.
An industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to examine the problem recommended last month that the government authorize the wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on its use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there are no valid safety reasons for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or deliberately do so.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.
New line aircraft depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems also resist interference better.
The vast majority of line aircraft are expected to allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
eBook readers, for example, only issue minimum transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who put pressure on a relaxation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders loaded a line plane of Kindle e-book readers and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has inspired FAA Advisory Committee members to have mixed feelings about whether or not the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings under low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling for common sense arrangements for travellers with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helitered bird from a platform in the North Sea has been released into nature
A bird, helitreluished after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released into nature.
The water rail was mounted on a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before it was put back on foot by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa rescue centre.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This stream of water was probably a wintering migrant who came from Northern Europe and found himself caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to provide our help."
The water stream was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses together and define what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do so, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 entrepreneurs, broadly representative of all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions in Great Britain.
The findings of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on the countries that are modernising and developing while the EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than becoming part of the long and arduous process of reforming the European institutional arenas.
When asked about specific policy issues – ranging from regulation of monopolies to product laws – most business leaders believe that control of these key competencies should return to Westminster's hands.
The single market has caused general discontent, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade zone – 40% of the large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and more importantly, our corporate survey revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to continue its efforts to change the Treaty and develop a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a "significant change" that restores power to the United Kingdom.
The stakes are high – achieving a change in the Treaty and better representing Britain's interests would make it possible to see a change of 16% in the vote in favour of maintaining the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is embarking on a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey show, for businesses this means refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels.
The United States in Halloween Colors
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed treats to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy's passage.
This year, therefore, the feasters have come together.
In New York City, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the "Greenwich Village" neighbourhood.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I finally got to put on the costume I had planned last year.
We're having fun like crazy people, adds Rhonda.
People are happy.
That's a good kid, that's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan feast celebrated on the eve of the Toussaint, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom states that Bulgaria's gas pipeline opens a new gas era
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, Gazprom's director said.
"A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project," explained Alexei Miller, Gazprom's CEO, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security on the whole of the European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and his counterpart from Ukraine, which transits most of the Russian gas to Europe, increases the level of risk in relation to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into service in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wishes to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced Thursday the newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, taking up information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory is 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutinies of the Bounty, an episode in the history of the English Navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, most of the descendants of the Mutinies of the Bounty, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend on the generosity of London at 95%.
The Council of the Island unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, 836,000 km2 corresponding to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, Mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The establishment of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to monitor them, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance vessels.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian EEZ, neighbouring Pitcairn.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese deputy governor
A former vice governor of Jilin Province in north-eastern China was sentenced on Friday to life imprisonment for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having touched more than 19 million yuans of bribes, reporting official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and those responsible for obtaining contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first middle court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "mouches" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, among them former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former head of the CCP in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest functions in the state.
But the government has not shown any intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating an independent body of the party.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two New South Wales YMCA employees were charged with sexual assaults on children following allegations made against Caringbah's educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it "had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization".
Chief Executive Officer Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assaults on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate by emphasizing, "external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that child safety was a top priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst ratings from four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities conducted in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years ' imprisonment.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's shortcomings in the safety of children.
Staff testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, kept them in private, seated them on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and who had applied for training in child protection because she was concerned about her behaviour, said that she found the head of the child services of YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who supervised Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General said that he rejected staff testimony that they were reluctant to report these deficiencies to their superiors.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they had with Lord have misled their judgment, which means that they have not reported their actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his point of view before the YMCA Council of New South Wales that, for the organization, the lesson from the "Jonathan Lord incident" should not concern "reporting" by staff, and counsel agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have the staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by the Director General of the YMCA for Children's Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid contamination of the evidence but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that it had been misimplemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but he recognizes that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old man expressed his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade as head of the country, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Special Envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East Peace Process.
When asked if he would like to return to the position of Prime Minister, Mr Blair would have responded, according to the London Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it may have happened, so..."
When many equestrian protest experts met in Cardiff to fight and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But nobody expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old child, win.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first guns, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – of the same size – were hailed for presentation, attitude and style during the annual contest held at Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat hat a bit on the side in a casual way to make his 2-year-old Pony Toffee parade around the track.
Fenton was hailed by judges for his unusual natural training qualities for a child of his or her age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has since trained with his Pony Shetland every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said: "Fenton and Toffee make an excellent duo."
They presented themselves to and against all, but both of them reflected the golden cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy about the joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to get photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for over 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: "There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded it."
He went through the entire length of the track running and even though he seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
The way he started, he'll probably soon participate in the Horse of the Year event – and I'm sure he'll do a great job.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and the way they paraded on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he really looked proud.
A Chinese newspaper that has launched a call "will be redesigned"
A Chinese newspaper that launched a front-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be redrafted, says a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted to television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a "complete overhaul," said the regulator.
The order of "remodeling" emanates from the administration of Guangdon for the Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on Zoomlion's listed company between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express's writing was disorganized," said the regulator in a statement.
He stated that he had decided "to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card".
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into those responsible at New Express and immediately re-engineer the newspaper's management team."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction engineer manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published twice a front page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted that he had published false stories against money.
"In this case, I hurt Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said to CCTV's public television network.
I did it mainly because I ran after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several important suspects have recently made televised confessions.
Specialists say that people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in a hurry.
The radioactive vapour leak detected on one of the two Charles-de-Gaulle nuclear boilers in mid-October and while the ship was at sea was "without danger to the sailors", but it is not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royale has just confirmed to us the "unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, DCNS, a defense naval specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, sent to the Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failing boiler.
"Everything is being implemented so that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment by the end of 2013," says DCNS.
And the National Navy to certify that "it does not call into question the program of activity of the ship" with nuclear propulsion.
Let's remember that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier comes out of an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had rigged Toulon in mid-October for training.
This is particularly so as to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "small damage", confined to the reactor's containment space, had occurred on the French fleet's flagship.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a great discontent on the part of the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, tax deluge, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to no longer end.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dollars dilapid could be saved in order to allow a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken from taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no problem with sumptuous spending and the maintenance of lame ducks: deficit cultural centre, high subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they are sold to or demolished by the private company.
It is also unfortunate to see the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable mention to the transformation of the former Wabasso into a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost to tax payers?
It is not at the public level to invest in such enterprises, but at the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that fishing lakes and piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the large decline in the population, water use has declined significantly throughout the territory.
Not to mention wasting it, the city will never lack water and the strict regulation of its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to accomplish great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without a loan settlement.
We have been run for more than 40 years by ties with beautiful degrees for most and I don't think a sheep breeder will do any worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
The US authorities described the 4-foot-by-three tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagant on a length equivalent to nearly six long football grounds, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, the United States.
The area is full of undefined warehouses, making it easy to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out by passing unnoticed, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They are sentenced to 10 years in prison to life imprisonment if they are convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, thus posing a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways that started from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue extradition warrant against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who took refuge at Ecuador's Embassy in London and applied for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "remission notice" against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be liable to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, asking that South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asks him to appear at a police station on the date and time of his choice," said a spokesperson.
He continues to violate the terms of his bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the opinion by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after having unveiled more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site fighting against secret information.
How biometrics will invade our lives
Finished the passwords to type to access his smartphone or pay for his purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future in which we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, even estimates that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person making transactions in a universe as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
The organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but they are concerned about it.
In 2011 and France alone, the National Commission on Informatics and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime," said Justin Brookman, responsible for consumer privacy at the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism in one, and pessimism in the other?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, hand contours and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity field at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection, as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand, presupposes a deliberate and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a security - we cannot capture this data without them - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
Consequently, research has been carried out over the last 20 years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to increased sensor accuracy and computer computing capacity required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the past five years, says Cyril Bataller, director of the Acence R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Security Research at Intel Labs.
Unique and infallible marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers judicial police services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in one hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognise one person among others) and authentication (make sure that the person is the person it claims to be).
The identification had so far concerned the issue of identity papers: the biometric elements (prints, photo, iris) must be compared with the information that the state has on all citizens already registered.
This ensures that a person does not try to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance to a hotel or store.
"We collect the images of surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities who move freely on the Internet," says Dany Nassif, who is responsible for the commercial development of biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Other use: take a picture of a quidam who queues in a store, track its progression thanks to facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logic (opening of a computer).
More recently, the presence control was added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend who points for another," says Cyril Bataller, of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the hit of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by Natural Security in partnership with banks and major distribution signs: when paying in store with its bank card, the customer does not type his code, but inserts his finger into a reader who scans the veins.
Experimentation is scheduled to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at the French merchants.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that she can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in a box thirty seconds less, it's appreciable," explains the manager of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"Digital prints are stored on a first server; people's identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is blocked if you try to move it," says Philippe Robin of Thales.
But, in the absence of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Privacy experts continue to be concerned.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras, and the enormous amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me afraid of the worst: widespread surveillance," said Andrew Patrick, Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A driving driver at 210 km/h with a hot drink between the legs was inflicted an almond of £1,000
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a warm drink put in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree in Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 to Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the conduct offence without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn from his licence led to a 6-month licence withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of £90 and a surcharge for a victim of £100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to break the bubble in London
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in Budget 2012, has entered a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than £2 million and annual fees for purchasers who choose to own properties within a corporation rather than on an individual basis.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, and represents £708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook said: "Following the increase in stamp duty on high value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law in this area, it is very difficult to advance that high value properties are under-imposed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
The prestige real estate – the 5% to 10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector south-west of London stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8 % over the past year.
The prices in central London show a steady year-to-year growth of 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a growing "internal market", south-west of the city, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) with a recovery, according to Savills' studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog's tail are related to his mood.
Previous studies had revealed that happy dogs moved more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs moved more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "Everyone knows that in man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was in other species.
He added that as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To find out more about how dogs react to the disorderly tail movements of other dogs, researchers followed animals watching films featuring other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't take long before we understand why their tails sometimes go on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We presented to dogs films containing other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion – and we were able to traffic the tail movement and present it as going more left or right."
When the animals saw a dog without expression stir the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog that stirs the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail drifting mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog shaking the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet several times with other dogs and notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to that experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Canine Behavior Expert John Bradshaw, visiting professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at Bristol University, stated that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads left when they looked at an aggressive dog and right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Dogs went more easily to a robot dog when their tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study."
He indicated that the differences could arise from the fact that dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
"Although many elements, identified in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert to Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed with his singer.
Sheffield's group was due to take place Friday in the concert hall The Hydro in the city center.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys stated: "Following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1. "
"Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20th and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will take place on November 21st.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest church men placed in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so François will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – it is therefore a group of 120 "electoral cardinals".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting bringing together all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony in which bishops will be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as consistory.
"Pope François decided to communicate his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal voters will likely have decreased.
He said that a pope usually named as many cardinals as it needed to have the number of cardinals voters reaching 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
Next year's Consistory will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March this year, Valero said.
For the time being, there is a tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world to examine ways of reforming the church.
Previously, the pope decided on his own.
"Now, François chose these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "very possible" that Francis asked the cardinals for advice.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is totally new.
Valero indicated that the popes generally raised bishops representing vast communities as cardinals, but that François was "full of surprises – so we don't know who he will appoint".
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the U.S. to repair the seat folder
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its all-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to resolve a problem with manually tiltable records, according to a Friday statement from the American vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could present a defect in the tilting mechanism.
As a result, the records do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The models recalled were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first American automobile manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the fault pickups in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the letter of information to the owners due to the 16-day shutdown of government activities, which slowed the growth in vehicle sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM stock price rose 1.4% to $37.47 at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks in Montreal on Thursday afternoon.
The drama occurred at around 11 a.m., on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie district.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been taking place there for some time.
A mitoyen foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the site in order to recover his tools.
I was driving and I saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who remains close to the site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered him.
We only saw part of his back, it's so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in the fifties who worked for a printing company.
Resuscitation manoeuvres have been attempted by emergency services, but have not been successful.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was sent to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
The cry of despair of an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says Obama has made commendable efforts thwarted by the obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading an awfully sad book these days.
It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morosity of the second year of medicine and give me back hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's the memoirs of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients' medical records in the evening and I slept, this book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could cut your breath.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and the presenters of the news newspapers took the time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment.
My comrades wept with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young visionary team was moving towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before taking office in 2008, he had 82 per cent favourable opinions.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really took place in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I put great achievements to Obama's credit, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act) to the departure of Iraq from our army, through the end of the "unseen or known" and the murder of Oussama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I'm on the verge of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
She cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor can the prosecution of whistleblowers who reveal the government's wrongs.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, or the evasion of public funding and the overexpenditure allowed during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive... since Nixon's administration."
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to allow for the determination of his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that we had been hearing for so long.
Yet, while the positive opinion index dropped below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me wish for the many promises that have gone away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses for Clinton at Pennsylvania Primarys.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
We are five years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred in Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fleron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid response of the rescue, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argued that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest in the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of that system.
The mining magnate, which challenges the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, argued this argument in an attempt to remove issues related to a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were prepared to benefit personally from these policies.
"He will have a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave," said Palmer.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast in Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer put forward the idea of a reshaping of the voting system to speed up the process.
The girls of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 a.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has explored options for electronic voting and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions "very seriously".
Public service is a matter of public service.
"We are not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York identified a new species of bumper dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible for scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marines (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of bumpy dolphin surprise you?
That's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
If in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographic basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge of species classification sciences.
It is not impossible, moreover, that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, family or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are called into question because of advances in genetics.
Similarly, two morphologically close species have been distinguished through genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific bumper dolphins and Atlantic bumper whales.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had been known to researchers for a long time, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present there.
Therefore, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we may be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered on the basis of the number of individuals on Earth, that is, the stock, and the possibility that it will have to recover from neighbouring stocks.
With regard to the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new species is discovered, its stock has automatically become smaller, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats where there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene brewing limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It is important to know that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, rather than knowing what lives in the Mariannas pit, only 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money in the search for life on other planets than in marine research and it's high time that this changes.
RBS suspends two traders in the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division from two sources close to the file, showing once again that the global survey of regulators on the suspicion of manipulation of the foreign exchange market is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators as part of the world's largest financial market investigations, where US$5.3 trillion change their hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the scandal of manipulations of the interbank Libor rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this case is continuing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and the other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file stated that RBS had transmitted instant emails and messages, sent to and by a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as European cash trading manager for the currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of cash exchange trading at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior foreign exchange trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, adding sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had brought an action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
Around the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining the allegations made about bankers who would have agreed to manipulate exchange rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, indicated sources close to the file.
Banks have been looking at instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
The news of these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth drivers of the trading units of investment banks in recent years, but which has been challenged this year due to the low volatility of currencies that limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast heavily liquid exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at a low cost".
The news came the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had returned a trader working in its office of funds traded on the London Stock Exchange this week after it caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was handled," said a representative of Crédit Suisse.
Mayor Rob Ford's investigation has been flogged, counsel supports
After the police confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby argued that he had never seen an investigation that was "so flattered".
Me Ruby told La Presse Canadien that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's occasional friend and driver, Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and accused him of extortion in relation to the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police said they also observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Me Ruby described as "unexplained" the fact that the police have never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or listened to his phone, arguing that Chief of Police Bill Blair chose in knowledge not to act against the mayor.
According to the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and carried out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also require an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Me Ruby's remarks as "obvious and desperate attempt" to appear before the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
In a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Stock Exchanges Falling in Mid-Session, except London
With the exception of London, the main European Stock Exchanges are moving downwards on Friday at mid-seven, led by some news from disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could establish its quantitative easing policy earlier than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of an inflation of 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea spreads among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
The futures of Wall Street suggest an opening of the rising US shares, after two consecutive retreat sessions.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) records the strongest setback of CAC 40, led by the result warning of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, having also published downward results this morning and announced the creation of an internal "bad bank" structure of 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the top of the EuroFirst300 increases in response to press reports that AT&T is studying a possible OPA.
On the foreign exchange market, speculations about the ECB's monetary policy are going well, as John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank, points out.
The ECB's single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at the next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the reduction of the euro.
In this context, the euro continues to retreat against the US currency and has reached a lower of two weeks at $1,3517.
These same conjectures support the euro area bond market on the other hand.
Supreme Court Validates Obama's Health System Reform Act
Great victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared that Obama's law on health system reform was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to subscribe to health insurance by 2014, under penalty of having to pay a fine – and stated that it was constitutional under the government's power of taxation.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the Act by 2,700 pages and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered, with the penalty of losing all federal funding for the program, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates for the 2012 presidential election in the 2012 primary, including the nominated candidate Mitt Romney, were fiercely opposed to the law.
Vibrating tribute to veterans in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet Cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute to the soldiers and deceased of all wars this Friday afternoon.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by M.P.M. Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Clandestine between Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded Thursday, 31 October 2013, at night, during a violent attack on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, 1 November, following the depletion of its fuel stocks, the Palestinian Enclave Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another Hamas armed wing commander, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a firing of tank shells during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Yunès, in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local leaders of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armoured bulldozer made an incursion of about 100 meters inside the territory before withdrawing afterwards.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri, paid tribute to the four "heros" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had died during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell by defending the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupier to Khan Yunès.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman threatened.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, an Israeli military communiqué explained.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device targeting the IDF forces (the Israeli army) and injured 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said Army spokesman Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel struck an air military base in north-west Syria, targeting a missile shipment destined for the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah movement, reported Thursday, 31 October, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli breach" but did not give details of the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he simply added.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that she did not name, the Saudi capital chain indicated that "the bombing targeted a cargo of ground-to-air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", in reference to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at dawn at an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquie, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopedias de Satie.
An evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, art to tics and black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, advances, of profile, fine as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, Henry Michaux's ink is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes shape.
And this form will be that of the whole piece: a string of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the play area, rush when the next graphic appears, embody it, emerge in current.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in relays of solos, in group to the unisson (a mass that makes solo), in large group of twelve solos where everyone executes his sign.
One thinks of "Glory of the morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, placed online at the forestage.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux's poem, monocord and monotone in the scream, and will continue by dancing.
And the music to leave, and the sequence to resume.
This loud and loud discharge, long, if possible, eventually stuns and numbs.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like those hair that tumbles or those black fabrics that stretch the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, imposed himself, with his tics.
Result: The bodies seem flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux's inks, like Gestalt's shapes, open up a wider and more playful imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers pierced by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touches the magic.
The audience liked it, the reception was warm.
The Gymnopedias, after the entrance, are richer.
The scene is partly littered with grey, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, such as furniture in a abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers are turning to play the scores.
Their bad addresses in music, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, they spend the couples, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving sets, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffons appear, also familiar with Chouinard, with a red nose, in very polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnassiers, runaways or players.
Gestuelle, laughter and small cries beautifully transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of the coitus, of the beings that merge.
But the room takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the cabotine dancers descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a wisely calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness pervade, and it is Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are being prosecuted for Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of old Nortel patents has begun an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that it coveted at the post when it auctioned patents that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 million, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the United States Court of Appeal in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that make it possible to display advertising related to search terms on the Internet, have indicated the conclusions of the trial, which is the core of Google's business.
It was not possible to reach the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that work under Google's Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally proposing $4.4 million.
After losing Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for an amount of $12.5 billion, a market in part based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in issue during the auctions, it has violated and continues to violate the patents in question," said the trial's findings.
Rockstar claims more damages against Google because he claims that Google's patent violation is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater at the origin of the explosion
Grandma would've lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a home in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, was due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, said Friday evening the King's procurator's substitute.
The expert sent on site by the prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
Grandma lit a cigarette while there was a leak and gas build-up.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is always engaged.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying at his grandfather's and his companion's house, was at his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long-term conditioned on site before being taken to the CHU in Liège, she by helicopter, he by ambulance," said the districtmaster José Paulet, who went down to the scene.
Traumatized, Grandpa was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the stairway remained intact while the rear wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the nearby house, weakened by the explosion, were rehoused by the president of the CPAS.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the Arches Police intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection stabilized both buildings.
Egypt calls on the first freely elected president to take an oath
Mohamed Morsi took the oath of investiture, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he took the oath of inauguration to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Mubarak who was expelled from power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of State of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He took an oath in front of the 18 judges in the black dress of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We look forward to better tomorrows, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," explained Mr Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been regarded for more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal and harshly repressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to cheer the new president and, apart from the presidential phase of the Mubarak years, the traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy into the busy streets connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered as the uncharismatic "relief wheel" of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased considerably since his victory and his Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges present in the woodwork room where he took an oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his investiture speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem while he was on guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand..." enchanted by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheatre of the university.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, from where the uprising that ended the authoritarian regime of Mubarak last year left, and vowed to recover the presidential powers of which the military council, which replaced the former president, removed it.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
Shutdown in the USA has slowed the increase in the automotive market
The 16-day closure of most federal governments weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published on Friday by the manufacturers, five of the top six having achieved performance below expectations.
The three major Detroit manufacturers show two-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market stood at 15.3 million, according to estimates by Morgan Stanley's analyst Adam Jonas.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight break is primarily explained by the government's "shutdown" and its impact on the consumer's feeling during the first half of the month".
However, GM reported an increase of almost 16% of its sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by consensus.
The four brands in the group saw their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit, among other things, from the success of its pick-ups, saw its sales increase from 14% per year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus awaited 194,301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced a 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also show sales below consensus, despite year-over-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM won 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford gave 1.1%.
Renault powered by Nissan's warning
Renault charges Friday the strongest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it has reduced its annual net profit forecast by almost 20%, traders report.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a review, also announced a change of direction.
Several traders reported that the Renault action was affected this morning by the "warning".
"This is clearly Nissan's warning profit," says a manager of the trading of a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of the capital of Nissan and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to data from the Nissan website.
Greece: Two dead in a shooting near a neo-Nazi party site
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by shots fired by two people who were on board a motorcycle passing in front of a site of the golden neo-Nazi Aube party in the western suburbs of Athens, were found to be a police source.
The police were currently unable to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that Golden Dawn members had claimed that the victims were guards of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers from the counter-terrorism department have flown to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident occurred a few weeks after the indictment of six golden Aube MPs, including the party's leader and founder, for participation in "a criminal organization" as part of an offensive against this party launched after the death of an antifascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's Appeal Rejected
Scott Brown, captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for the next two League of Champions matches of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
The Scottish community was expelled from Barça for sending a hit to Neymar and was suspended at three UEFA meetings.
In a press release, his club said he was "very disappointed," believing that his call was entirely justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes are being deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after noon on Friday, due to the violent winds affecting many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected areas are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers plunged into the black, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The great region of Montreal also knows its lot of breakdowns with nearly 7,000 private power homes in the metropolis and Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecast upwards and hopes for record results thanks to holidaymakers from Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects to realize an underlying profit for the entire fiscal year between $325 and $340 million before taxes, against a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If the current forecast is reached, this will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner said that Flight Centre had achieved 8 per cent profit in the first semester and that the second semester had started in force, particularly with regard to non-business travel to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present have been profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record results for the entire fiscal year before deduction of interest and taxes," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded during the second half of the year, making it possible to compensate for a slightly lower domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure travel sector has achieved good results while business clients have spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses during the first half of the year where the seasonal demand was lower and had to benefit from the entire fiscal year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre's shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown people shoot at a hotel near Cairo pyramids
Unknown hooded people opened fire this Friday on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without making victims, as a result of an apparent quarrel with dismissed employees.
The attackers fled, said the spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, police general Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt receives almost no more tourists since the army dismissed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and reprimands in blood the demonstrations of his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature courses, students will have to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fictional work from 1914 to the present.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage a more diversified reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
Starting in 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first materials to undergo radical revision.
It will make changes in other fundamentals next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Examinations Regulatory Office, will unveil a redesign of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said that there was "a broad consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence," stressing that the GCSE would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singapore students do about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to maths, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the in-depth math GCSE – as well as the greater importance given to subjects in international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of education.
The program will focus more on "real world problems," including financial mathematics.
This judgement means that a law adopted in July in that State and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An octogenary welcomes children with a rifle at Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 used door-to-door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy district visited by the children opened the door by holding his hunting rifle.
The old man, 86, explained to the gendarmes that he had been scared.
His weapon was seized.
The former head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trace, was actually buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive at the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he assured on a daily basis by drawing on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would respond to one of the great enigmas of the After War.
The German secret services, the BND, ensured that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were totally wrong.
"From August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Ministry of Aviation by a commando," says Tuchel.
He was wearing "a uniform of general."
"In the left inner pocket were, among other things, his service states with a photo," he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the town hall of the district of Mitte in Berlin stating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The President of the Central Council of Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, declared himself shocked by this revelation.
One of the most brutal Nazi sadistics buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormity of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is grossly spreading from the foot," he insurgented in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the leading figures of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had, in particular, under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistic" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

It walks in mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend watching hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, for the election "Heros CNN of the year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and went to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he was going to carry after the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get any treatment he could get.
"It's not easy," adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, go to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
In comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 population.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians would not be able to pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the country's health expenditure is in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," said Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed more than 700 surgical acts free of charge over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which goes to rural areas during weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped close to 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they sit in vans after fixing the medical equipment on the roof and cross hard terrain to get to the villages that most need help.
Luck doesn't always follow them.
They had to push the vehicles many times to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best available housing.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to party, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began receiving hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people on each visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – a document necessary to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team practices simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, a town hall or a house; after the surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the wake-up room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It's an erect rhythm, but village musicians usually help the team to stay motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work," said Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 surgical acts free of charge during the last year, and it knows that their presence can make a difference to those to whom they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"It will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to living this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, that funds 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, it is an opportunity for learning on the ground that they do not have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help drain the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," said Ms. O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not nearing extinction.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others to live happily by keeping his promise to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," said Mr. Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and alleviating pain are the reasons why I'm going to do that.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long combed to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and classrooms?
Probably, but underlining his weakness for the crossing paths, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitrator of others' works in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Heir of the chair occupied by Fontenelle at the French Academy?
True, but knowing that such a sacred one cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which has passed away.
They willingly recognized in him a great awakening, animator and federator of their work, but noting that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The bad languages were able to see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a sharp glance and a hard-on of erudition, but incurably amateur.
The two books published by Nora two years ago have already established that the one who passed to not write had much and well written.
The book here should definitely do him justice.
Yet, once again, there is the temptation of ubiquitousness, intellectual vagrancy, retirement, which began to jump as a foot together from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the brocantor back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive node of the French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: It's a concern of the time.
Few of us have been collectively invited to give a definition of it.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders then, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obligates, was entrusted to the prefects and subprefects, authorized interpreters.
The one Pierre Nora is after is anything else.
He does not pose as heir to an eternal franchise, he refuses to define himself.
Analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stopped every step by an object in the form of rebuses, tormented by irritating questions.
Of which it is born from the company itself: why, in a country so long-lasting located within its borders, so formerly charped and solidly masonized, do we hear these dramatic calls to unity?
They are only so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, to conjure up the disorder born from the discords of French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the division forces here are very old.
And the most emblematic of course is the one that splits national history into two.
Starting from the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchy, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without denying it; rather than finding it sacred and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility as it had cut off the head from the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation of it.
And from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of the French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps outside of the Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American escapade might well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to form a new society.
But U.S. cosinage only makes it better to emphasize what is our own.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men encased with an ancient indigenous regime, and all the more radical.
There a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and confit.
There are still honored founding fathers, and here revolutionary ancestors who are struggling to make models, and who have gone between themselves.
There is an institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, as many errors to catch up and trials to be resumed.
France leaving, France coming
Yet there was a time when the French thought they could put on the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of number two.
At this third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a great deal of interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscurely prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity has only had a time.
Here it is again under debate, driven by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of vindictive minorities, absorbed in the European space.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France leaving and the circumspect sketch of France coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
We found out that the fireplace was a housekeeper.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The smoother was located in the center of the centre.
And the one who had deposited, here more than half a century, a subject on the idea of a nation, but had subtracted himself from the initial exercise of the thesis, confides, cum grano salis, that he will have done it.
Certainly in a less rigid, more broken and more subtle form.
But let us not be mistaken, just as binding.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
An old hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
In Beirut on 8 March 1986, with three members of his "Antenne 2" team, filming a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage defence association "Otages du monde", which he has been chairing for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to file complaints and bring their hostage-takers to the International Criminal Court.
Detained more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they were able, since then, to find their families.
And try, gradually, to resume the course of their lives.
"The New Observer" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former major reporter, retired since 2008, president of the "Otages du monde" association.
As of the evening of your release, you were on the 20h plateau of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
In particular, in Beirut.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's black - Roger Auche.
He says we're freed, but I'm not sure, and he says we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but we're also very tense.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the Summerland hotel website where the press is present.
French people take us to the French Embassy.
It's time for the first calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in t-shirts at the French Embassy.
I also remember a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arrived there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We're landing at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible bump.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three TV channels.
I'll be right back and there's plenty of them.
The descent of the plane stairs, the reunions with my son and my parents, my friends, all of this is extremely emotional.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers are pulling their ass to take pictures and follow me to my place where I have to do some police to prevent some from climbing.
Media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're suddenly under the media lights.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the hardest thing.
The same night, I'm at 8:00, the next day I'm on TV too.
Then begins a kind of rehabilitation to life, very slowly, for one or two months which are a little like a holiday.
How were the medical examinations and DGSE debriefing conducted?
I was entitled to a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was made in Val-de-Grâce the following days my return: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything, but we know that we can count on it, remind it if we need it, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostage takers.
It was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages in Niger?
I'm listening to what you're saying.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things piss me off, others less.
I'm trying to share things between questions about my past as a hostage and my cap as president of the "Otages of the World" association that allows me to distance myself, and it seems much more interesting to me to address.
For example, I wonder about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fight, together with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there's a semantic problem.
It is necessary to qualify hostage-taking as "political" hostage-taking - which is the case most of the time - and to allow hostages to have access to justice, to lodge complaints and to bring their hostage-taking to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for that.
Why don't we say to the hostage-takers, "You have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we will bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, to be well founded, legitimate, in common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened, and it shockes me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger grows in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of President Mohamed Morsi was opened, they went down into the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country's first democratically elected president.
It's not a trial that highlights this Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a joke.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial insurgent a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to try Sisi, not the opposite.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Confrontations broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses 9 American States of violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defense and the benefits that come with," the minister recalled in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League to fight anti-Semitism in New York.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the facilities of the National Guard," he denounced, accusing these States of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these maps, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said that he had ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The frowning of the nine states began with Texas, which refuses to implement these benefits on the Texan National Guard's settlements, due to a conflict between the Texan Act and the Federal Law on Homosexual Marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior Defence official.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned with the recognition of homosexual marriage to approximately 5,600 active persons, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and pensioners.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place on Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are taken on-site Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and qualifying phases will begin in the wake, at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the awards will be given at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend the competitions at the highest level, like the young Hyerois prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years of age, he has already won his place for the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he does not like it so much as to rejuvenate competitors who exceed him by three heads.
The Mayor of Toronto hunts journalists to question him on a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drugging, according to several media outlets.
A video submitted to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The person concerned, Rob Ford, has always denied having used crack, while recognizing that he has a cannabis penchant.
On Thursday, he kicked out of his property several journalists came to interrogate him.
We also think that sometimes images do not need explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced Thursday, October 31, that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in Val-d'Oise, clearly of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on 25 October in Argenteuil and died on 28 October.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Institut Pasteur.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of people who could have come into contact with this kitten between 8 October and 28 October included," says the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"In man, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the press release states.
Departments now call those who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or skin injured by this kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to be contacted on 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"France has been free from rabies since 2001, and this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not free," according to the press release.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last reported "Aboriginal" case of rabies dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Bureau of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from Gambia had been recorded in 2008.

Obama reverses his health system reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unequivocal and often repeated promise that "if you are satisfied with your health care, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their claimants, Republicans criticized the president in recent days for accusing him of cheating on the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with adequate health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "a thrill in the news" about terminations, President Obama urged the Americans who received these opinions to seek new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better adapted health plans for the same price, even less expensive than expected.
"You'll win," he said.
The Administration has announced that it should not be surprising if the 5% of the population who are self-insurgency are forced to change their plan because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius in his testimony to the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed "sadly".
"I am as frustrated and irritated as anyone," she added.
I can't wait to get your trust back.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, while she believed her micro-cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the Assembly meeting yesterday following an exchange of views with Billy Long, the Republican representative of Missouri, on whether she should join the Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long insisted on asking Ms.Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced the government-sponsored insurance to subscribe to a regime via HealthCare.gov, which now boasts millions of Americans.
Vettel trimmed a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky one, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colours of the automobile brand with the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the level of the track.
The German Sebastian Vettel, quadruple World Champion of Formula 1, trained for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday a special helmet whose drawing was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose from 1,500 drawings sent from all over the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of his stable.
He was invited to follow Abu Dhabi's GP, with a friend, so he can see the German champion closely on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday to the test.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet for the race on Sunday to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party of the suburbs
Let's not be wrong.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Part of the suburbs" is not only addressed to the suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies it.
When I speak of the suburbs, I address myself to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
However, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his native municipality of Aubervilliers, was born of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes the neighbourhoods above all.
My proposal 1 is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, a territorial attaché, claims today as "100% apolitical" even though it has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left, but if right-wing people are willing to support me, I will also listen to them, he continues.
There are only extremist parties I'm not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program - consultable on the Internet - from many themes intended to speak to the inhabitants of the suburbs and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years of age, the rehabilitation of the function of a building guard...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this is likely to be fair, he admits."
It's a matter of time and money.
The Party of the suburbs should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune already has seven lists in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I've received since yesterday don't all come from the suburbs," he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage "had gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry indicated that the defensive attitude of the United States towards its monitoring programs was softened by admitting, without precedent, that on several occasions espionage "had gone too far inappropriately."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he had, like Barack Obama, ruled on "automatic pilot" when a series of incendiary revelations by the denunciator Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities came to light.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have become aware of certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course on September 11."
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the line, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said: "In some cases, it went too far inappropriately."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and clarify clearly to people that he was now conducting an in-depth review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr. Kerry stressed, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to jump."
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and arrest them before they act?
We have prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being killed because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, said the president of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut indicated that he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made regarding the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations because of the feeling of frustration caused by the surveillance of the National Security Agency.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in mutual engagement in the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chairman of the U.S. Senate's Subcommittee on European Affairs, during an interview from Washington.
And I am going to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some US allies, but the Agency's director said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations referred to documents released by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the German Chancellor's mobile phone Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified the spying of allies by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a Congress trip this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and the two chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show "affective firmness".
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programmes they have been implementing for years.
"We can change our monitoring programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world to do espionage," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry planned to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the grudge generated by American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by United States surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, led by the poor results of Shell and the day after an announcement by the Fed of keeping in the state of its support for the economy, as expected.
An Australian woman calls her sentence of imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the trial and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Provincial Court on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had attacked her early on Sunday, 10 June.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to inventing the story of all rooms.
She was detained in a cell at the local police station before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in a low-security detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of the former player of the Australian Rugby League Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Canberra to help his daughter.
Tunks told Sunday Telegraph Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to go back to Australia.
"We've obviously had a distressing time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after a deposit of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increased sentence of up to two years' imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to replenish its damaged image with tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.

Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school commission
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated a year ago a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to think about how to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school commission has just unveiled its vision of "Live together in French".
Vision diversity has been walking in schools for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of a strain or have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"So, we create projects so that they identify with all this," says Vision Diversity President Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the Institute of the New World, identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the feeling of belonging, the support to staff in the transformations that we live in, within the student clientele," he says.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school commission has created a research centre that will give tools to teachers who, too, sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the Scientific Director.
Preparing to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
"Different teaching strategies are the real need," she says.
The research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
