Triumph of the populist right in Austria, together make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought about the first approximate results, a considerable weakening of both parties of the great current coalition and an expressive strengthening of the party of the populist right.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current President, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphal return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent votes, thus losing 5.5 percent vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still has the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent votes.
These are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the people who called these early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in terms of preference for the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government shipwreck.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculations were heard about the resignation of the party president and, to date, Vice-Chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers believe that it could be reached this Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party's presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and closer starting point of electoral results, i.e. the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties on the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, one hundred percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would be repeated in 1999 when the populars negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it dismembered from BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a sanction by the European Union.
For this evolution, Haider is clearly betting who has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that he is already taking his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament, although it has lost slightly and declined from the third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and therefore is not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India can cool down
If we fail to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been charged in India for illegally collecting beetles, we could come to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
Thus the minister manifested in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this was not resolved then yes, then it would certainly come to this cooling," he observed after the meeting organized on Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempted from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local Darjiling government in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
Then you can ask for exemption from the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises to appeal to the High Court and then pardon would be possible," said the Chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convicted person a "legal competent support," said the Indian minister.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already obtained by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining with India the best relations, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the ČTK said to her colleague, she insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a trembling mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The minister eluded the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I've received quite a few promises," he just observed.
A Czech arbitrates a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, it represents Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as one continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean Law and Sea Affairs.
His head, Director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this heel and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed hides up to today a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms until today that themselves carry the key to the development of cancer medicines.
The bottom is bigger than the firm land
Countries with coasts have today begun to fight vigorously the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is essentially the so-called continental border, which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
According to the Treaty, it has exclusive rights in all the resources of the continental border.
"Simply, the continental border means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the limit of the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request made by the country to the Commission for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Border Continent must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal expert assistance commission.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward," Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a global impact as it was the first to substantially expand its marine dominance.
However, it was also achieved by New Zealand - the seabed area that the commission granted last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, almost six times more than the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains for their study.
The profit that will be derived from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their applications.
They can do so up to ten years after they ratified the Montego Bay Treaty.
Where the continental border ends, the region of the Oceanic Fund declared by the Treaty as "common heritage of humanity" begins.
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold mine," says Director Mikulka with emphasis adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its contractually defined regime".
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares with other countries of the then Eastern Block within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a treaty as investors as well as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it's something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
"An area of a total length of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretion deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a little potato or a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the liberation of the hostages the command of German special forces was at the place of action
To resolve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for Germany's help - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are becoming known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the action of salvation, German special forces also indirectly participated.
Therefore, at the place of release were the specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, squadron plane of the federal police, of the Federal Criminal Investigation Office also experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity institution.
As the spokespersons of the ministries reported on Monday night, the German forces did not need to because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany's help to use it as support on the spot.
"Fortunately that moment did not come," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On September 19, in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt to the hostages they were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers was unknown until the end as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the saved healthy and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages released were under the custody of the German embassy.
He didn't say a word about the details of liberation.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from Germany's air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives does not approve the package of salvation
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress lets a large 700 billion dollar bailout for financial markets fail with little.
The Dow Jones fell very dramatically.
The United States House of Representatives rejected with 227 votes against 206 the government's package for the salvation of financial markets.
Despite all calls from President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, it did not reach a majority for the program with which disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With a dramatic action, desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the large 700 billion dollar package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations had asked the Members to vote, although the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet absolutely happened," he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was the investor's concerns that the state's salvation package could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
The experts have other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order to allow the program to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organisers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to a study, despite the weakened situation the desire to travel of the Germans remains as before.
As the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin reported on Monday, with travel bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent higher in comparison to the same period last year.
According to the GfK market research institute, reserves for the fall months had already risen in number.
Thus the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, reported the DVR.
The basis of the results are GfK figures which are the information analyzed about reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computes approximately for the whole market.
The data collected are travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened course of the dollar especially travel to the United States is of great demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost one third.
The preferred destinations of the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and power prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well reserved, so that the volume of sales compared to last year again increased - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, comparing last year, decreased.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the parties under the sky open in the endless Balneario, beer in 1 liter jars and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut at a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a traditional Bavarian suit to measure.
I have dark-colored hair, I'm a student and my dress is already used.
But there's one thing that unites us: we're barely in the tent, the photographers have already rushed to us and filled their memory cards with photos - it's very flattering especially because I'm first in Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costumes seem to fulfill their function.
Actually as a tourist in Oktoberfest coming from northern Germany my feeling of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costume to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado of Teresa everything is not so much.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; none seems to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A munchess draws my attention to my apron that had dressed wrongly: "The left side is single, half is virgin, on the right side is compromised, behind is widow. "
Oh, God, now I'm hanging from behind the left.
"It's okay," he says laughing.
The others do not worry about many subtle methods to flirt and wear caps where it is written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistly is called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time in Oktoberfest.
It seems to him "gorgious", which pronounces with a very long "or".
He tells me after he put his glass next to a liter of beer he just drank.
He put it right next to the fire mouth, most people think that's a trash can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who knows how to drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
About eight o'clock in the night, health care groups run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
The toilets appear every time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered walks from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: They come sober, they come back drunk.
You don't see who's suffering from alcohol levels and he's in the walk.
"They are the ones who "can't anymore", gave me the answer by a health care provider answering my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Accident victim identified by the police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood City, was involved in the accident at Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
Since then, he has been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey intended to be a member of the European Union, the European powers encouraged the desire to enter the country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps inland Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in a neo-renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set to time the end of the platforms and leads in front of two towers, one for each corner, looking like a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decaying.
But once the vaulted locker was over, there's no doubt what the company's greatness was that this was the westernmost door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that was cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Its railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell below
British rule and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
The Turkish sources commented that it was sabotage.
Since then the station has fallen and stayed out of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new partnership policy.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went up to a bunk and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, expert in foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a shock trip, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - new city, designed to govern a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus
which has raised some suspicions in the West and, especially, in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping centers and "power pastry shops" where middle class managers in business suits - men and women - meet first thing in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
I brought it, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey has been cut in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the East and the West at the same time.
It's not a case if it's not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "Turkey could be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he replies, "does not want to face that choice."
Next, it underlines one point that almost everyone I have spoken to so far had recited to me almost in memory: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the whole Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at Hydarpasha Station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returns to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East, to a large extent, would be in Turkey's hands today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So there is not much doubt on which continent this fascinating country must claim.
Lifes to remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (Scale, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for children under 21, but at the time that Proteus sang his final in 1979, several of us were finishing our 20s - we just refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the changing mythological being of the forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, either madrigal or Messiaen, regardless of whether not accompanied or with a complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to that man's inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in music.
So you just have to sing!"
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, although never taxive, nor too flowery.
Whatever the musical escartar, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I have never, by any one, been disappointed – otherwise I have often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two well-known war horses around the world."
We'll miss you so much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (25 September) you affirm that "in 1946 he resumed his economic history studies in Oxford and in 1950 he won a research grant from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a degree, a master's degree and a doctorate degree."
This is learned in a note from Woodruff's author at Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at Nottingham University, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a scholarship from Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to ignore this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida" because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
I was drawn to attention by their simplicity and by the force they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda's supersales
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had ample habitability, this new monovolumen presents an even wider interior space.
All this is complemented by refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz aesthetically presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz arrives six years after introducing the first generation into the market.
One first observation is, therefore, that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than that used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a phenomenon of sales.
This is the case in Japan, a country where Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly a million Jazz units have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda wants this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a 17% growth in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly pale down sales in Spain.
In fact, the brand expects to end the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a 16 per cent drop.
Despite this increase in Honda sales it has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to achieve 2 per cent in 2010.
To achieve this Honda quota trusts the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a hybrid of five doors and compact size - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By market and according to Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will occur in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation in partnership in the month of January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its odds.
Its length is up to 3,90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1,69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes up to 2,50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - is up to 399 litres, 19 litres more of the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measurements are of the version with the 1.4 engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 trunk is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear squares.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, in front of the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines are also new in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will have two petrol thrusters of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2 liter mechanics achieves a power from 90 horsepower to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. to 4,900 laps.
This propellant - which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has an expenditure of 5.3 liters and a emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
As for the previous propeller, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, now becomes 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The bee car that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, in particular, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Center of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Brand Management Technology and Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an expansion of the Security Shield from four areas of Nissan.
This robot intends to strengthen the collision prevention capacity of the brand's vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that looks very much like the Nissan Security Shield.
But the most important thing is the composite eyes of the bee, capable of seeing at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, which allows you to fly without interruption within your own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles that are up to two metres away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to a microprocessor on board which, immediately, results in the prevention of collision.
"At the time you detect an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a straight or higher angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, for the small robot to avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can function continuously with only a couple of dozen KB memory.
This may be surprising, but we're not talking about memory gigas, not even mega."
This is the first step to develop new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan vaticin will introduce into serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles along the way.
Tiembile before mortgage
It must be recognized that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of fluid to make injections, is not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from embarking on garbage mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a meek and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the Hotel of Bad Credits... or Troubles.
The tetric aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
True, he has useful but undetailed information.
It's more a page for teenagers than a place for all audiences.
What if the game is completed?
Well, there's a dream room in the hotel.
Something's something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disbursement nine billion dollars to acquire 21 % of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its stock exchange.
One week after discovering a provisional agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of the ordinary Morgan Stanley shares at a unit price of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the book value of securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure you a yield of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the overall transaction would be carried out on the basis of a price per unit of measure of $29, or 28% above its current change.
Morgan Stanley, however, lost 6.79 % to $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
" This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status, " explained Juan Mack, the general manager of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the larger names on Wall Street to adopt a much more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, he explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, "we thought that participation would have been composed only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we have wanted to minimize risks and cover ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7 % below its accounting value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20 % of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares within one year if they are sold more than 50 % above the conversion price, i.e. at $47 more or less, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capitals contributed by MUFG will allow him to take investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
However, a spokesperson for the group refused to give details of the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of close to 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needed to have greatly alleviated his balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, who saw their stock exchange contribution fall in half while the cost of security against a risk of defects on their debt took off.
This cost declined last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch's purchase, announced that they had raised $15 billion, partly for Berkshire Hathalway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the twenty-first century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, he is the third one to vote on a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results referring to 80% of the vote.
According to these results, "no" achieved 28 %, 7 % of the votes cast were null and 0,7 % were blank.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the start of the electoral centres and a count from a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory to "yes", estimated at between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Sunday night to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The " Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly " had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians leading the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Michaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will be held in full calm, according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " advocated by the President.
The draft Constitution implies an increase in the power of the State over the economy, reserving it the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and through foreign currency sent by its emigrants.
Under the leadership of Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives strengthened powers to the Head of State, who can make up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of the free provision of health and education services which the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provided for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which would put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 abducted persons have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by the Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them looked good when they arrived at 1530 hours on board a special aircraft at the military base of Al Maza, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Some helicopters immediately transported them to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical testing, so they were unable to speak to the press.
"They find themselves in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana at the airport.
On 19 September, these hostages fell into the possession of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari in all-terrain in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then they have moved from one zulo to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of the safari organization.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, carried on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
" An exchange of shots took place, and they killed half the kidnappers, the others have fled, " said this official who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "light" unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commanders.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in the secret services, the special forces," he said without going into detail.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the eve of the day, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an all-terrain aboard which were the kidnappers, of whom six were killed, including the Chadian chief and two were arrested.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a statement immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place and is taking place in the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are starving?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why do we not have true laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to restoring only Chinon's castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that heritage protection is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned about searching in history, preserving with little money lots of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and responsible throw their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The Governments of the Netherlands nationalize part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands states - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation to the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis which is in distress due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the American market: the three countries will support in total with 11,2 billion euros to this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at the highest level with the President of the European Central Bank and the responsible for the economic competition of the European Commission.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer from the crisis in the Euro area in the context of the international financial crisis that has been taking place in several waves more than a year ago, so the decisions taken with regard to the Bank, in a sense, can be regarded as precedents.
According to the decision taken on Sunday morning, the three States will purchase approximately half (49 per cent) of the Bank's property in its area.
The Bank will certainly sell a portion of its business, including mainly insurance activities purchased last year by the Dutch ABN Amró.
The actions of Fortis began a sharp decline last week and for the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree to point out that with its 85,000 employees this Bank is too large to allow it to break down.
The company's shares only decreased by 12 percent on Friday, being the lowest in the last 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Observing the current prices of the shares, the total value of the group's capital on the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company's executives this is not real.
The Bank's management attributed the sharp fall in Fortis' shares to the insecurity of the US market in connection with the approval of the $700 billion US package plan.
On Monday the shares already showed a slight increase.
On Friday they appointed Filip Dierckx as the new general manager of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had already ensured that investors did not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
Among the Bank's clients so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
The Fortis has its own branch office in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Zorro in the henhouse
In the United States, life and health insurance companies, when they see data on the purchase of medication, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which to the use of prescription data in all cases binds it to the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the chicken to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the price of insurance and the amount of compensation for the customer's health and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They first sent the client to medical check-up and signed the contract with him already knowing the result of the check-up.
Dick ten years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: with the customer identification number he easily obtains from the pharmacies the list of medicines purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion on the client's disease and health status.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that the level of fat in your blood is virtually incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
They circulate numerous versions of the program, some even set a risk number, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has little to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the program's disadvantages is, for example, that some drugs are multi-use, for example, certain substances serve both to treat headache and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk enhancement factor for insurance companies while the former are not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process these data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacies, request the patient's approval.
The authorities are already forcing them to do this, although they have not received a fine for negligence so far.
Some companies have also recently developed the results of laboratory tests and combined them with drug use data obtain more accurate information about the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to these data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
Congress already has before it the bill that gives the authority for the control of specialized companies for the provision of personal data.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: therefore he developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that this person cannot deny his approval, because if not the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, despite everything, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
Marseille Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
Since the European Union and India are reciprocally trading partners, this issue in addition to the other problems largely global dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
While the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic developing power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue was not addressed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President-in-Office, José Manuel Barroso President of the Commission and Javier Solana Senior Representative of Foreign Policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, that is to say to increase their trade to more than 100 billion euros.
In view of the fact that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious objective.
This brought the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India into line with the law, and air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade treaty with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth largest trading partner in the Union.
The summit paid its attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of terrorism - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also urged, although both sides have a great responsibility for their failure.
The EU confirmed that it will hold on to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20 percent.
India also agrees with this, as at the climate conference next year, a global agreement should be reached and the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 per cent by 2050.
They also wished to impede the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris trusts that French companies will be charged EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers to the international show of Frankfurt's book.

There will be a meeting with the stamp at Room Struktur in pavilion 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospectives about the state of the editorials in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors gradually decreases over the total Italian production, and in particular for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the missing millionaire a year ago
the remains of Steve Fossett's plane, the millionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, have been found.
The debris has been found on an altiplane at 3000 metres above sea level, in the Nevada mountain range of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
The Commissioner of Madeira County, John Anderson, has dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have the confirmation that it is the very thing that Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said at a print conference.
The Commissioner has specified that no human remains have been found on or around the plane.
The 63-year-old millionaire was killed in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) has reported that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a team of investigators has been sent that has identified the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from Nevada's trust, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents named Fossett, the two issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted one month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a position in history thanks to a long series of primordials.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world's turn into an aerostatic balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world's turn by plane and without ladders.
Among his records, also that for flying at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemes with an original and well-established design with defined lines and defined angles.
This is, in summary, Glk the last born among the all-terrain "compact" vans of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Suitable for content out of the traditional, will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication accompanying the launch of the Suv Glk, available in the exhibition rooms Mercedes-Benz since October 17.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that dominated the central street of the Milanese shopping, avenue Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication began with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images will have the impression that the car exits the poster.
Next, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, to recompose in a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
it's clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Trivenet, the ban on access to sporting events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys from whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and that so far, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fanatics either.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The promoters come from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia have been added a small group (times units, actually) of the Campaign and Apulia.
They have three-color flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been removed so that they are not identified.
The English fanatics are inspired.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of real Nazi fanatics, the Levski.
Figc had made 144 entries for the game available to Italian fans: all with names, so easily controllable.
And the minister of the interior had already controlled them all: among that which had gone out to Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fanatics, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have rejected the ticket and also the trip.
Now the Ministry of the Interior expects to read the actions coming from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to the fanatics who have been arrested or to whom has been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) which prevents frequenting not only Italian stadiums but also those of all Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't stand in a stadium anymore.
Lucky!
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others are added.
"We have to put an end to this fire right away and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they say of the Ministry of the Interior.
That's why "well-open eyes" especially in view of the National Party of Wednesday in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small nucleus of Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also have a section of the Aise (Information and External Security Agency, that is the secret service, which takes care of the problems at the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the arm raised during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...".
This is Domenico Mazzilli's thought (expressed in an unhappy way) for a few weeks now the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the post that before was Francesco Taggliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics who have been shameful.
"I don't make the sociologist – adds the No.1 of the Observatory – the reactors are attributed in the countries in which the fact happens.
So far this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles to Mameli's anthem: also those are not a crime, but if they do not allow them to be of education...".
