What's going to happen? CSSD doesn't know Voldemort or pastry in Prague.
CSSD's new elected officials at the capital's city hall will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understanding each other at the municipal council level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the argon that was born in the last few years at the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition who were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cream launched in the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been discovered that the new elected officials do not understand very well the known terms.
At least they say so.
"Who's Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a fast in Pragian politics has reacted Lukas Kaucky, the culture-elect at the test of the word of the "father".
And with regard to the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the sense of "golf hole".
"It's the only expression among those you propose I use"
Otherwise, I don't use the argon.
Of the vocabulary, of which the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-eectoral congress of the ODS, the writing selected 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague City Hall.
Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the patisserie, "beef nerf", "treason of the capital" and "intole".
Three of the elected members agreed on the quiz, the quatreme- Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek completely refused the test.
"I do not care at all about these things here and how the representatives of citizen democracy are having fun: I will not give my opinion."
"I'm currently working on how we're going to understand each other in our programs," he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the legend above, that it is the influence Janousek has on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he has become in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky says and immediately adds, "But I know about the newspapers."
"I'm gonna have to pay for a language class," he's joking.
Not only the Karel Brezina matador but also Lukas Plachy, the chosen one for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"It's, I think, about going to a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it's the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
In the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from the newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests, there is no argon lexicon in social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues and it turns out that we really don't have something like this."
"The names are said to be sometimes used for abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, whom members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that, admits Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for Party members or the least friendly Little Old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by the scams during the party's sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little game".
The nicknames are also the only ones that allow social democrats to use inside the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda very much, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this pragmatic president.
"Doctor in law of matraque" recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title as doctor in law JUDr. at the police academy of bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "sorcers", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They are rather part of the old generation, cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and have no child.
The one who becomes a "sorker" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man has very rarely this destiny."
"You also don't judge young women in good health because they participate in work and give birth to children," says a sister who works in the capital of that West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He published a brochure that should help limit witch hunting.
The case has a hiccup.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the daily Die Standard warned about the disadvantage of written education.
The charge of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had sprinkled on her.
It was the BBC server who transmitted this information.
The criminals say it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointings ignited in the woman's contact.
The oil flaming, it seems, when the team wanted to "hunt the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "sorceres" is approved by people at all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human spirit eaters have always been a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso was trying to reduce witch hunting, the Gambia had not even seen the President himself participate in the hunt in the past year.
"Gambian President Dzammi, after his aunt's death, launched a large hunt for witches who, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have tried by black magic to kill the President as well."
"Shamans from nearby Guinea came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal custody of the President, men and women randomly chosen in the villages of Gambia," said in a message the organization "Amnesty International.
On the farm, the imprisoned people had to drink a potion based on plants with hallucinogenic effects that caused in addition to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive it.
About a thousand people were released from international pressure.
The tenant of Bakal: The poles are heating, he has signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out the door of the RPG Byty customer center of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was holding a file under his arm with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his, his daughter's, and his son's, who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel", shows finger on his son's new contract the man who has the power to sign.
"But I've signed anyway," he explains, "he's stirred up anger and half resigned.
The citizen association of BytyOKD.cz apartments, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be used to claim.
But man reacts to this by a hand gesture.
"One says that, the other says something else" by rubbing the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic expect whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory".
RPG's waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava area and is already full on Tuesday at 09:00 in the morning.
Right next to the door stands a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "Loyer 2011", is turned on on the touch screen.
A single pressure and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your "157" number that your number already starts lighting up on the large screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to find out about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio receive mail with new leases in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
the special window for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still on trial," answers, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The deregulation and former apartments of miners in Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported this fairly strongly before the elections and now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change a pot...n board in the toilets, relieves the man mentioned in the introduction.
However, it is above all, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they now sign as promised by RPG in a special offer.
It is half the amount of the rent that the other tenants will receive who will have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," says the employee at the counter.
And yet RPG poses both on its website and in the windows of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent it is an independent court that will make the decision.
'These are not threats, but only to inform about the unique and legitimate way to act legally', says RPG on its website.
"No one will go to court" thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man on the street in front of the customer center gives him reason.
"I have 13,000 kroner and I have 5,000 kroner left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore the people wait," she says.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, in addition, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, who is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen attached to the ceiling in front of the padded chairs of the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and concerns no less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments'.
"And it will always be 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," says the screen.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low sum 19.66 Czech kroner to m2", adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not lead to a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase in rent have priority.
The nursery school is also part of offices that included architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint of Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected him to also house a mini kindergarten with everything he needs - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch. design employees can go there.
The Arch. Design. architectural project company, whose workshops produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini-maternity business school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially the age to make children, and it was important that women architects and project leaders could quickly return to work.
At the same time as reduced-time employment contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Manufacturers and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work with care for children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design.eu who imagined this nursery school and with the support of management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-maternal school is financed through the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding allocations (up to 2.8 million Czech kroner) they were able to purchase equipment and appliances and after two years provide qualified personnel and start-up.
After using the funding endowment (two years) Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini nursery school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it was the Economy rating company that helped make the application for staffing.
Care for children is provided by qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher attend to children all day. Children can go to kindergarten without age limitations, but they are over three years old for most.
Since it is a "mini nursery school" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace themselves.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although he is involved in individual care and education, the programme of the mini-maternal school is comparable to that of pre-school education.
Children do not only play, but quality education is also provided - from the beginning to preparation for school benches English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and do not have the stress of a delay to pick up the children in a school away from the parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look inside Gaudi.
The cough resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the stairway with a spine of dinosaur and the balconies with open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received from the premises the nickname of House in bone.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, facade recalling scales and everywhere present curves, this is all ypic for the Art Nouveau d'Antoni Gaudi.
The front façade of the house unfolds its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see the geometry, rhythm and order thought with precision.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of the doors, eyelet and lamelles.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number. 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
Reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another brand new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But Casa Battlo's idea as a house with multiple dwellings was not thought of by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations were born for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
Other artists and creators also worked for the façade.
The common work for the plans of Casa Battlo began with successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the house hot just after its finishing because of its organic forms "the House in bone".
Others, in view of the specific window opening mechanism, called it "the house that dances".
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the patron of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its time of central heating, with vents of ventilation and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems odd.
During the creation of Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the directives for the construction of then and did not allow itself to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained a permit from the city to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finishing the municipal council was horrified and demanded modifications.
For example, the members of the municipal council did not like the building pillars to be built on the public sidewalk.
There was never a change, but on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and got satisfaction) for permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented at a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase that leads to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of space binding.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the lounges and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has received in addition to new facades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, blue and white glazed tiles with which is decorated the inner courtyard and with light wells.
The two-colored game gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark which, on the contrary, absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house, which was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund, may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found it to be a lucrative company and expanded the field of visits to the common spaces and attic including the terraces of toast.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a mattress: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the area reserved for bed, so the mattress and the ground floor provide a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive: weight, size, age, state of health as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which you will place the mattress and the mattress is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where we do not sleep continuously latex mattresses are not suitable because they "heat" slowly.
They also have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Moisture can also form there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
The one who spends the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a softening layer, will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all the hockey players who come back from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a squeezing foam layer."
"These mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore mistakes "information" of the joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in stuffed furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy mousse conquered the hockeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also Czech Tropico have for example suitable mattresses.
You don't need to be an NHL guy so you can enjoy a lazy mousse.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won't be back in the night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
The lazy mousse also works as a protection against squaring.
To choose the mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of 180cm size therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, single beds, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association des Bourreliers-Materlassiers et decoradores, which for several years devotes itself to the problem of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaches it in specialized schools.
For a two-seater bed each needs its own mattress and mattress, so be careful however during the auction to choose the height of the mattress well.
Otherwise you will only have to climb the ground floor at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which count for the layer of shape and ventilation at least three centimetres.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress, you should not feel the springs," warns Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-determined type of somme.
The sleeping bed, when the mattress and the sleeping bed are united as siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; it should not be washed, which is usually done today.
And since during the night you normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this purpose, specialists refuse to make a claim for a lifespan of 25 years for a mattress or a life guarantee.
But everything to his but.
And for this an experience advice from the sellers: for a 120/140cm mattress, give up, for the mattress coating, hygiene or washing but rather add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to make coatings with zipper closure for the whole whole, that is to say that after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) otherwise handling for the big models (and for only one person) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a bedbed?
Never!
Maximum for one bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are no ventilation holes) and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with sachet springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an aeration layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For sole-positioned soles with 14/18 lamelles, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more lamelles, 28 and above, where the lamelles are doubled in the lower part of the kidneys and thus it is possible to regulate its rigidity.
For multi-position mattresses it is not necessary to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to changes in position.
Next to adjusting the stiffness of the blades, you can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
It is a special bond of the lamelles that allows to press or even tilt the lamelle so that the shoulder of the sleeper "fits" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back," it's really an important thing.
This is already envisaged by the mattress manufacturers who for the "male" have begun to use a shoulder softening area.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at hip level.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or platelet springs with what is called a multiforce suspension.
Pressure spreads into more points and dilutes tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and air-inflated) on good mattresses and mattresses, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians for example prefer.
When elongated on the side, the pillow must upgrade (with the top shoulder cradle or the padded area in the mattress) to the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something common with the first straw-based and grass-based mattresses.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also to organic mattresses.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soy oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"The Bio Qualifier for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr Vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop scents of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While extracting from birch plants so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for low sex.
Current favourites?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a cellular structure disturbed therefore more breathing than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesss of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, bottom of the back and feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, it was Gumotex who reached first place.
Saving for mattresses and mattresses is not easy.
From time to time, there may be two mattresses for the price of a single one for special shares by manufacturers or producers.
Like for example the company Magniflex that offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam Memory sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
You can obviously take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with Tempur material at a "cosmic" rhythm.
This started as a material for NASA because astronauts were experiencing enormous loading factors.
The Tempur melts in the heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is ideal for this against sleeplessness and for an increase of comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that relieve legs and the venous system.
For example, Czech manufacturers use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
The devices to track people are increasingly being asked by parents who want to watch their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about watching them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can be used just as well to trace the movement of people and help in some cases, such as that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a box of matches but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka has moved many people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about espionage, but only about another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracing devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons," said Pilin.
According to him, children should always know what "box" is used for and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to wear something like this on him, he will get rid of it.
'And even the little ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something on purpose when they don't want to be under control.'
" Cell phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is highly questionable.
"If this is a prepared abduction, the author will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate it."
"Currently, it's the phone."
"As soon as tracing devices develop, they (criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She admits, however, that such devices can help during an attack not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, who offers tracking services for both cars and people, he claims that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it is on a regular broadcast after a specified period."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains."
'The most expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and finds himself in a lying position without moving," says Cech.
According to him the so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special prologiciel.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn as a pendant of the size of a box of matches or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the possible attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he'll find out after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as for tracing cars.
This is a combination of a GPS position acquisition system (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating ropes that it could go around the Czech Republic with it, but it can only last two years.
The army bought 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Already last year, the Ministry of Defence had bought 224 km.
So the army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the cords is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating ropes from the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as a reason for the auction of a huge amount of detonating cords to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km a year.
According to the reserve calculations made by the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even the generals, officers with command, secretaries or household staff should have an annual explosive exercise.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
That distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the army's reserves could support it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is sufficient for more than 2 m of detonating cords, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has assured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - of reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the Rapid Intervention Brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their fist weapons and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
About the lack of body laundry, we don't talk about it.
"And I don't take my head if they buy so much detonating cords from us."
"And that's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good customer that we strive as merchants to content," says the commercial director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of miles of detonating cords are being drawn from the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, mentions only four years of life of detonating cords and pyrotechnicians of the police and army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the warehouses, it can even go up to four years," says one who does not want his name to be published in view of the criticism of the army.
The length of life spent, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating ropes.
"They cost us 60 percent less than the last year's supply of 245 km," says Spokesman Pejsek, who interprets the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cords of police pyrotechnicians that neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always only order the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and in order to be able to obtain more flexible types of detonating ropes more modern and more reliable.
the Ministry of Defence today has major problems with the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact time when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading to the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralizing hundreds of kilometers of old detonating cords that it now buys "at a cheap price".
To date, I have benefited from the contacts I have obtained through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel has helped Lukas Pytloun to win the competition of the best Individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition of the best Individual Entrepreneur for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Libérec there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned when working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region has made me want to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvests the profit in the building that he turns into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 guesthouses, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun hotel design.
This year another of the same quality came to him.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the franchise of Pytloun hotels showed up," last year's entrepreneur number 1.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the competition of the entrepreneur of the year has served well," Pytloun adds with appreciation.
Victory brought him more popularity and being known in Libérec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, they often congratulated me and, I have to say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses his contacts and knowledge so far that he could not have obtained in another way.
"With those I met thanks to the competition I began to maintain business relations regularly.
According to him, success-related fame also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
"I especially observe at home the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that has generally been recognized."
"This is not, by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," says Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to seek the prize in Slovovsky dum for the first place of the contest for the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a company with a turnover of 100 million kroner.
'I can say that the award not only encouraged my employees, but also increased our self-confidence in fighting competition', says today the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of Farmet's history there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of the goods by the communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he was working at the time, and created a company with some comrades in his father's surroundings for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years he became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to really get to know the Farmet brand, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were collaborating with a company that got the biggest success in its home country," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not happen to Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the 2008 and partially 2009 economic results.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We have obviously not escaped this situation."
"Business figures fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even license," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and maintained beneficial results even if they were inferior to those they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued uncompromisingly to invest in research and development.
"We built a training and research centre with endowments, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibitions and won the main awards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything leaves us to believe that the crisis is behind them.
The number of employees also increases with the number of employees.
"To the new winner I desire this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes foolish regulations.
The year's absurdity survey is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be deleted.
This year's poor winner of this year's survey of the absurdity of the year was the obligation to bring to the offices documents that staff members can obtain online.
More than one third of the 4000 voters voted for this.
For example, the social affairs authorities asked for a paper extract from the trade register while the grievor can get it in two clicks of mouse.
It changes because of the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the trade register for insurance payment controls," said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fill in in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this contest of the absurdity of the year.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and is still more popular.
If the last year 3000 voters showed up, it was at least 4000 this year that brought their votes.
And it's not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only slow down the company, and, this, more and more.
"We may be the number of documents to be completed for tax returns at the forefront of the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneur activity becomes a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared with the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic stands at 74th in terms of the conditions for the company, 8 more places than last year.
The year's Absurdity competition was first set up in 2006 and continues each year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report every year the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September, the last time before the closing of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the contest organizer selects seven candidates for "antiprix" and lets the public vote during October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihened.cz.
The absurdity that received the greatest number of votes is declared a winner.
Until last year's survey, it's about 100, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
The remarks are sent by entrepreneurs as well as professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore, among the nominees is, for example, the obligation that highway and fast track maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of the seven proposals is published on the website of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition, which always starts in early November on the Place Wenceslas in Prague, is part of a happening in which people of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts sticks in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to delete, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the company," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decretes is not a blow of sword in the water.
In 2007, what did not please people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days before to the office for the individual company at the place where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Individual Business Act.
The second most successful obligation in 2007 to report a 30-day duty travel to the Labour Office was removed with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything is okay until the third session of the contest.
The 2009 Absurdity was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This has been changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the obligation to have a refrigerator has been removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has been in existence for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of 2010.
The adjective of this competition is support for the reasonable and fair enterprise.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impacts of their business on the environment and carry out socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the competition of the firm of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodaphone, have registered companies that have not succeeded with only one long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspirations and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the object of their business is different from one another, their support and forecasting activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the entire Czech Republic there is no example of the Prago Prological Society Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm in charge of the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund for children with disabilities for 17 years.
The old paper manufacturing plant in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of it, has been awarded the title of the company Responsible for the Central Bohemia region and has placed third in the region in the contest of the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, MiRyz Soft, a financial company, won for introducing flexible working hours and even reduced up to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionally, reduced wages.
The jury also handed him the title because it acquires priority from Czech manufacturers, supports ditoyan activity in the vicinity and is concerned about the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration will have the least impact on the environment," explains Miluse Ryznarova, executive director of the company.
the company responsible IT Enlogit of the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected plant for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadow who helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
In the last rank, also for its activities, is a company of Cleaning and Cleaning of the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased qualifications and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the construction company of Bruntal Czasch, winner for the region of Moravia-Silesia.
All regional finalists for Vodaphone's Year Signature competition were automatically registered in the Responsible Company category, who had responded to the attached questionnaire of the registration document and referred it to the organizer before August 15.
The incomplete or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the firms in high school had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm Responsible but were not disqualified from the competition "principal" the Firm of the year Vodaphone".
"Independent registrations are not possible because this is a sub-category of the main competition of the Firm of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the Organizing Agency Bison&Rose.
At the Lands Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public competition
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local contractor and real estate trader Lubos. G.
The latter had tried to handle precisely a public tender for the settlement of a request for restitution in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a particular candidate.
He was supposed to pay Lubos G. half a million kroner.
"For the time being, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for an insider offence as part of a public tender and competition," said Plzen Antonie Zelena's head of the Public Prosecutor's Office in Pravo, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
The police released this 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
To find out how he could influence a public competition, one can only speculate with regard to so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokesman for the Lubomira Cerna Lands Fund said that the police had actually arrested Plzen in a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a client and in no case an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Appeal to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and is put in place when several legal candidates manifest themselves.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their right to restitution that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a ranking of the purchasers is established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," said the Fund spokesman.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had registered for the appeal and since he himself is also a beneficiary because having purchased a large number of rights to restitution, he had proposed that candidates on the ground not participate in the competition.
And he'd probably cash in by retiring.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his inquiry.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the standards at the FdT (Land Fund).
It was in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for publishing land for which the decision to establish a construction had already been published.
Just Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, in concrete place and place where the artery of access to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it would risk putting the construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay a supplement of about 100 crowns monthly for housing.
Households will have to pay a surcharge not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
From January onwards, families will have to pull up to a hundred crowns a month more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas is almost 2 percent more expensive, in some locations you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to approximate the 100 crowns per year for households in the apartment than at present.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices given the significant development in encouraging the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at a time when people need it most to heat and thus have the highest consumption.
So we can also count about 100 more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 more crowns per month, families in Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague a 9 percent increase for water and sanitation is being prepared in case the city increases the rents of infrastructure.
If the rents do not change the pragmatics will pay a supplement of 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 per cent.
Rent prices will, for example, increase significantly in the 450 thousand rented apartments from January onwards, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by society.
The regulated rents that people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
The Czech children are drunk with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts softly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
They are drinks that most often bring those who are drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for recidivism are not the exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions from hospital children's departments.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk."
'The trend is really strong alcohols', says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a bottle of Dad into the closet, it's sometimes about wiki but it's the fernet and vodka that prevails."
"Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so don't feel it," says the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for the Motol Hospital, also gives her reason.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"Today is fashionable alcohol, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was a slivovice that they brought back from the house," added Jurinova.
According to the Head of Department Pelikan, seeing drunk children aged thirteen to fourteen years in hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practiced ten years in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the wide surroundings completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
"She started her 12-year career when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with an extra mix with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it doesn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter is missing 48 hours," said the Director of the Department surprised.
It is precisely the parents' disinterestedness or their unusual tolerance that their rejections are the main cause of children's alcoholism.
According to specialists, however, there is no mention of dependence, in its strict sense, on children.
"Under the word alcoholics we mean a chronic dependence on alcohol of several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that we do not find in children".
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is rather a significantly unfavourable socio-family background," explained the Head of Pelikan Department.
According to spokesman Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with large intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Intoxicated children who are after emergency care brought home by parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, he has three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of witches, Saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"They either drink in spite of bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"Of course I lived on the day of witches an admission of 7 drunk children at once," said Pelikan.
The drunk child who spent the night at the hospital in detoxification under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who came home and suffers the day after the "woodface".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are much better for this because they spend an excellent evening and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only surprised at where they are," adds Pelikan, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care bed hospitalization can reach tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I have applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to repay one evening," said Pelikan.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regression management, which should recover care-related expenses from parents, do not treat cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the manufacturer of Casa-EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time such devices have become the property of anyone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad in the context of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-platform versions of the L-159T1 which have so far been in service in the Czech army and which are in flight condition.
The remaining three devices are single-seater versions of L-159.
They are currently stationed at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody's aircraft is currently unknown.
'The L-159 single-seat aircraft planned for the exchange have been taken on long-storage aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence.'
"Biplaces L-159 T1 have been exchanged in the state," Pravo Pejsek said.
He played that the army will not remain without a biplace since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-places into two biplaces.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it is committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of certain countries of the Alliance.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that the one that takes L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account how to achieve this," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion kroons was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue tenders and contacted EADS directly.
Defence management argued that the exchange ensures a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and used only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has lodged a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected as part of a European tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annular is a sign of low cancer risk
Men with a longer index than the annular are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple risk test for prostate cancer, especially for men before 60 years of age," said co-author Ros Eeles, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could help determine which men should undergo the prostate cancer test, including by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, said Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the annular.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had the same length of fingers, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
For those with a longer index than the yearbook, however, the risk has fallen to 33 percent, for men before 60 years the decrease in risk has reached 87 percent.
The length ratio of the two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, among other things, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it was testosterone that helped develop prostate cancer.
Prof. Vacla Pates, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Czech as most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On roads and sidewalks, there is most of the time compact snow, pickers have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and the 93rd kilometre towards Rozvav due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno towards Prague suffers the same fate.
The Dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the information
In the 91st kilometre a truck was hit, in the 93rd two heavy vehicles hit, the accident injured.
Several cars also found themselves in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km towards Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at 190th kilometre or go through Brno and then enter 182nd kilometre in Kyvalka.
A row of cars of several kilometers formed in this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow of several centimetres thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car lines are created, for example, in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Tramways, for example, lag behind the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff is still to meet.
Railways and the airport also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove because of the snow 7 fast links.
For example, lines from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11:00 in the night until 5:00 in the morning.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but increasing vigilance.
On the road of Vyskov, three side roads are impractical, on the road of Brno there begins to be snow gulls in places and on the road of Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain channels of communication in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region has been among the most affected places.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them you may need to send snowshoes and strawberries.
We can't estimate when they're rolling.
On the road to Hodonin caution is of rigour in the white Carpathian region.
On roads that are, given the protection of nature, maintained only by the aspersion of inert products, there is nevertheless a layer of 5 centimetres of snow warned TKC.
In Chechnya, he fell between two and 10 centimetres of snow; he fell the most in northern Bohemia, with often up to 18 centimetres of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell to 15 centimetres of snow.
The snowfall gradually disappears in Chechnya.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army sent a new "smart" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as code XM-25.
The generals think that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "go change the game" to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a super precise cannon.
Its projectiles are laser-guided with a precision of a few meters.
The special 25 mm-calibre ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive, actually works as small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that they will explode at the contact of the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
So it can be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
Nor is it protected from above, and when it falls upon it a deadly rain of steel flares, it can put it out of combat as well.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier uses it primarily in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtaining a specific point of view, according to which he corrects his target site and presses on the relaxation.
"Let's say you targeted 543 meters."
"When you press the relaxation, the weapon loads and pulls at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," said Audette.
400 jobs relocated
Fujitsu Group is moving its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer to Astro Park their workplace which is currently located at the Place Mareinbader office building in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese Fujitsu group is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant specialized in the manufacture and maintenance of computers said on Wednesday, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on Marienbader Square of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße Street of the Niederrad District of Frankfurt.
One Fujitsu spokesperson explained that in the medium term, the group should bring together another 100 jobs that have been scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive. In addition, Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to employees' working methods.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Director General Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with a remarkable infrastructure."
He claims that the connection to the airport is of great importance to a global company like Fujitsu.
Yesterday, the new move of a major enterprise within the region sparked the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "global actor" had been conquered.
It is a "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of settlement".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its establishment is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," Korwisi said.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer in dealing with the owner of the building at Place Marienbader.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding that such an exceptional place remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and lessor of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the neighbouring "vertical small", as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa resort.
As a result of a joint project by the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the train station and the City Hall. It raises many criticisms, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces that once served part of the parking space, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advice company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Frankfurt specialized Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu together with the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group based in Tokyo is considered to be the world's third largest supplier of computer products.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch located in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has much more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park building.
This old 20-year-old complex, whose name is reminiscent of its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electrotechnical Industries.
Amazon's Server Expulsion - Threats Against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing increasing difficulties.
The Amazon Internet service provider has expelled from its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may mask political pressures following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, apparently resides in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with increasing force.
The cyber-activists group " Wikileaks" no longer has access to its host server so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably staying in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," said cyber activists who gave rise to revelations via the Twitter social network on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the cyber company, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Following the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyberactivists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the highest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Forbidden, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
CNN TV, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon had banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman's employees.
The president of the Senate Commission for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier in view of previous Wikileaks publications of classified information," the honourable senator said.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wigilaks acts illegally, monstrous and unscrupulously, and in doing so puts our national security at risk and endangers life all over the world," said an independent senator's statement.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the contents of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, appears on the list of persons wanted by Interpol.
According to information published by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the prosecutions against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats were made against the site.
"Calls were even launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is particularly worried about his safety," Hrafnsson said.
That is also why Wikileaks' founder continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly responded to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the leader of the Wikileaks revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the Chief of Government Advisor Mr. stephen Harper stated on television, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone".
Meanwhile, there was a controversy between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for US President Barack Obama, described the fact that Mr. Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently released, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the assertions of a website."
The U.S. government now completely passes the database protection to the test bench.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed responsible for combating leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" made indispensable after Wikileaks' disclosure of diplomatic cables.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects the information.
In addition, the US government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they were ever threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said the Spokesman of the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of the Ice
At the Gelato University in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day induction course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice-cream machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the somewhat outmoded ice confiscator, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making art.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, disposes it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, there is no need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice can't avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorbetieres founded the ice university in 2003 so that the ice creams released from its machines meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day induction course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered for several days. Also, practical sessions are held in private ice cream.
In the middle of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk realizing their burning desire on smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia and from Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of artistic education from California, is a fierce member of the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer a quality European product in the country of the Industrial Glaze in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a company management advisor and she wants to draw some singular from this challenging business for the nerves after a few years.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian maid came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
Not only is the good flavor decisive, but also the silky flexibility and the good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, from the south: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats up to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then cools immediately to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: it comes out a pasteurized base white cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice creams.
The trainer is immediately asked a question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can one give free course to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano cautions against being misled by the spirit of time.
The one who speaks only of ice "made from natural ingredients", may have used stabilizers despite this: most often a natural product, e.g. guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will bite nothing but ice granules.
Some changes in the base mass are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
Master Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients that are acquired in the fruit or confectionery radius of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to give you dozens of aromatized ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
In the recipes of fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and, when added to cocoa powder, forms the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must move on to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purées: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice doesn't necessarily have the taste of the nut, when it consists largely of hazelnut.
The kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly picks up the taste of an ice," says Luciano.
Icemaking is a calculation exercise: if fishing mashed with a lot of sugar is used, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is needed for lemon ice.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the winegrowers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
It is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the basic mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the available ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it smooth and reduced to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo barbates with fruit from head to toe and, thus, splashes his fellow studies when the control of the colossal bowl blender escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that a "such incident may occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that is experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has cored the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said M. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech in Munich on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the president of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi pressure group.
The latter is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has worked decisively in the development of the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements drawn up correspond, in each paragraph, to the positions taken by the pressure group Ilsi and thus bear the mark of the industry which, at the bottom, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parma in Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior executive of the Efsa recently joined the Swiss food group Syngenta without condition or transitional period. In doing so, she changed camp.
A short time ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union control authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions both of the German Federal Environment Agency and of European Members.
However, the Efsa admits no conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including those of industry, are exploited as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of the Efsa are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Kuiper admits that he works for the United States-based International Life Sciences Institute.
This body is seen as a neutral forum for experts who belong, among other things, to the field of science, industry and policy in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. They disagree that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feeding tests in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the effects of genetically modified maize cause the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not all genetically modified plants, which does not allow for reliable results.
"If we don't look for the risks, how can we find them?" asks Mr. They about an accuser tone.
This is also Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Polytechnic School in Zurich.
In this region, as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
For this reason, there are hardly any researchers who are not related to companies.
In the view of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck states that "the industry controls security research."
The Stone Trace
Uli Gsell procured about 400 kilos of it.
Monday afternoon, she was standing in front of Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was a manifest.
It was snowing.
History is known: By September, the excavators had come and started to demolish much of the northern wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of the central station of Stuttgart into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the cessation of construction work.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a tender and coarse pavement poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
He got a few fragments of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically states: "A modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claims that by cutting it on the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with this fragment.
Rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
the traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to a former deposit of ammunition from the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man is trading old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or disappeared in the dump," he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He says he was insulted and threatened when in September the newspapers reported that he had purchased the rest of the northern wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything to oppose demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the stone parallelepipeda weighing on average 80 kilos whose value is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half of them are still entangled in the forest, the rest of which have been sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardeners, Privates.
They came from everywhere and took everything they could get into the trunk and the trailers.
These scandalous stones of Stuttgart have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or limitations of grass plateaus.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"was not this political component."
He enters his car all over the ground, making the turn of his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He did legal studies that he abandoned. Later, he began studying biology before he subsequently became interested in computer science and eventually became a carrier.
And a stone lover.
The stock is 40,000 tons.
He accumulates treasures everywhere in Germany.
He claims that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's cooling down.
Sandstones carved with art are laid on the snow.
"Sometimes, they were part of Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, says enthusiastically.
"My favorite stone."
He's on his way up through the forest.
He shows a bunch of fingers: Stone of red sand, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Nice travertine."
The parallelepipeda was once part of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart's rostrum.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertine from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the Cathedral of Saint Blasien, the tuft from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What a job, what a effort, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thought that the stones were once hand carved and moved with simple palans and carts drawn by oxen, he became completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were to be destroyed."
He didn't become rich, even less rich.
Today, however, 14 people are employed. In addition, stone tailors, a sculptor, a forgeron, a glass blower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding," says the waste recycler.
Soon, he has to go to Cologne.
There too, there are stones to save.
Fighting talent to conquer high potentials
The counter is experiencing a sharp influx.
16 students flock to buy small salmon breads, tomato sauce and white-eaters.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the automotive manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a kind of competition of ideas, they need to talk about the future car with VW designers, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen company.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body by body in the competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multi-faceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most gifted graduates as far as possible in the amphitheatres before they arrive on the labour market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, they try to identify outstanding talents in the context of practical projects and to trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the technical university of Brauschweig the automotive group loved the talents.
A young lady from the staff service shares the pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs for young talent; she shows them the way to access the group's premises.
It is Nico Selle from the technical university of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can know the students, look closer at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as a collaborator."
According to Mr. saddle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive we're trying to attract students with.
"Sometimes, the focus was on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much more bitter.
In goods in the sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting on a kyrielle of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and, above all, shorten the highly skilled workforce.
It is above all graduates from engineering sectors who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering posts remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI's forecasts, the vacuum for engineering positions will grow further.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, audit firm, accounting and consulting expertise.
It organizes costly events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of rally-paper where competitors must find their way with GPS coordinates.
The company will thus send eight promising students next year so that they will travel in this way to the United States.
Participants can also visit KPMG's subsidiaries and learn about the company.
The person who is to participate in the selection process shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr Dykta, the means used for the search for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little."
For the talent hunter that Mr. Dykta is, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we have remained in contact with all those who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and want to send their applications to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct crowding on the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are doing quite classically by participating in the trade fairs where they engage in brainhunting.
"We're trying to reach graduates by participating in trade shows."
"For example, at the solar technology fair," says Satha Stübe, Director of Human Resources at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company located in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs Stübe is aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are put to the competition on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It's expensive and takes a lot of time," he says?
Another way to make contact is to go through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to conduct professional internships or write his or her completion project at home."
A costly advertising campaign is being announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a large group cannot do that," says Ms Stübe, head of staff.
Money has long ceased to play the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany's top 100 employers.
The Institute is an annual honour table for German employers.
To this end, he asked the employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and context while looking at the framework conditions of the employees.
The head of staff Ms Stübe hoped that this placement would enhance the company's image of job seekers.
"I think that candidates rely primarily on external evaluations with respect to a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employee Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies who wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first and foremost taking internal action.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through their own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"satisfied collaborators are the best messengers."
When dealing well with their employees and identifying with the company, they do their employer's advertising to their friends and acquaintances on their own.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, a state in the southeast of the United States, over the years to come.
The Washington government has pronounced a ban An equivalent ban and thus definitively cancels its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is currently prohibited.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It was the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform that led to this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident that has cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, said he was willing to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating black tide in the golf course is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing several billion-dollar claims, is at the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry created by Obama must present its conclusions in December.
In October, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar lifted the freeze of drilling decreed after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after numerous accusations of corruption, is currently undergoing extensive reforms.
At the same time, Obama announced that they would be removed from the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil groups.
The players in this sector now publicly warn against the fact that the flow of food into the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's objective is to curb the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" as a result of a current survey carried out in the sector by the BDO audit firm prior to the drilling ban imposed on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what will change exactly with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water that flows into the rivers is oiled brown; it emits a smell similar to that that that exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live in theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't run out," the environmental activist told journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man in the muddy water to the chest, as well as the fat sled that surrounds him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the glow of water with the color of the rainbow.
It cannot be seen that the basement is full of brown crude oil sheets.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom says that she used to collect shrimps by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely tari.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil came out of an oil pipeline that exploded in the immense swamp.
Fishermen living in the small neighbouring town of Bodo must now row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the ravages jumps to the eyes when crossing the mangrove marshes crossed by rivers.
Instead of clear water, the motor boat cracks a Crading brown water. Anyone who dips his hand in it removes any oil-covered water.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the soil like licorice sticks. The isolated palms let their palms hang sadly.
We seek in vain the clouds of birds, as we usually find in the wetlands: As soon as the off-board engine stops, a ghostly silence falls on this paradise of old which resembles a gas station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is a war against the environment," says Celestine Akpobari with a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni have been living has been a field of battle for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. The latter was carried out later. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today again, the return to Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are daily pumped thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of Ogoni country are unexploited, because the situation there is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred meters stands in the water of steel curtains as strange sculptures: The heads of drilling holes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are crushed by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time, because a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion litres have spilled over the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that which occurred in the sea during the accident of the super-petroleum "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who is responsible for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and siphoning of pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider drilling heads explosions and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner accused the Shell Group of applying substantially less stringent safety standards to Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the failure rate of pipelines is "still much higher than theirs".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of camouflage and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with camouflage to the neck.
A sparkling fire under one of the many barrels that sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without motive on the site must be spotted: a small clandestine refinery.
We heat crude oil in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, team leader.
At first, the gasoline enters a container by passing through pipes, then at the end of the kerosene drop pipe fall and finally diesel is obtained.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre Diesel drums daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
The people of the Delta benefit from the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: Because they buy their raw materials free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" who put the network of oil pipelines in perce throughout the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country thus loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a very insignificant small part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: The networks of organized crime, which also include among its members high-ranking politicians and military, charge the lion's share in tankers and bradent on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether to attribute environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the laxist mode of production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen's lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refineries."
But, in the meantime, Ogoni's relations especially with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was no longer about the withdrawal of the group. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will prove better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you got rid of it," says the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers may appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers, especially from the north of the country, intend to enjoy as well as all Nigerians, raw materials.
"In any case, this damn thing has brought down our country very low," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 is clearly suffering from a major security problem.
When examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, the investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "caustrophical failure of the reactor."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, Airbus passengers belonging to Quantas had clearly been more fortunate to date: In the course of the investigation it conducted, the Australian air safety authority found that the reactors of certain A380 aircraft had a serious safety problem, and it cautioned against a possible lack of construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the oil pipe, it is indicated in a position taken published this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a catastrophic failure of reactors.
The Rolls-Royce reactors are concerned and are equipped with 20 A380 series aircraft.
Quantas Airbus, which had to land urgently on 4 November in Singapore, is one of these.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against society.
Quantas Director Alan Joyce stated that his company would claim damages in respect of the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the ignition of oil that causes the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that additional safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with question reactors.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesperson for the ASTB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the plane's emergency landing, the Quantas airline had immobilized its entire fleet of A380 on the ground for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its 11 A380.
Lufthansa has replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
The fall of snow throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
In the winter, Germany is grilled: By freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimetres in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they were unable to get rid of the snow that was constantly accumulating.
In addition, violent gulls swept the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office for Marine Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects that the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal will take place during the sea.
Snowstorms on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the Weather Weather Alert Center announced the level of violet alert was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it's the highest level.
In places, there fell 30 centimetres of fresh snow that the strong and cool winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the land of Saxon-Anhalt, police authorities have announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On Highway A2, the snow and wind caused traffic to stop and caused plugs.
In Thuringia, snowfalls hit highways A4 and A9.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions of rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, trees falling on railways, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport in Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to stop his trip.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds swept the roads.
Snowfalls have resulted in numerous flight cancellations at Germany's main airports.
According to a standard spokesperson and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A Fraport spokesman said that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers trapped at the airport are no longer numerous, although only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday afternoon.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car made a barrel on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce a good news: Snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will whirl in the event of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to less than 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution seeks buyers for its two office buildings located at its seat in Frankfurt.
This building could bring up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group's headquarters: Twin towers located in the Business District have been modernized; in the meantime, bankers had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group clearly seeks to recover the costs of renovations and it seeks a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesperson.
The Spokesman did not indicate the reasons for the proposed sale.
He said, "We'll check if it's more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or sell them, and put them back for rent later."
For example, Germany's largest financial institution has already given up its seat shortly after.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank had acquired the twin spins for an amount of EUR 272 million from the holders of equity, and then they had their rehabilitability.
Energy optimisation transformations have, according to some indications, engulfed around EUR 200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, the experts in this sector estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green towers", at about 500 million Euros.
According to the Spokesperson, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank fund or an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who have perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have had a thought for the buried miners who have been reported dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
We had not yet been able to lift the bodies because the safety situation of the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors between 17 and 62 years of age had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the damaged well, but no traces of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue teams were able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that minors no longer had a chance to survive.
So far, the bodies couldn't be brought back up.
Today, parents and friends have organized a feast in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a shining sun in Greymouth south of New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 minors buried, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothing and surfboards, also had their place.
The flags were set out in front of all the public buildings in the country.
New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key told the participants at the commemorative celebration that New Zealand had fuelled the hope that the miners would rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pits said he could not resign himself to accepting his son's death until he saw his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin were also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
The rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Police chief Gary Knowles told journalists that when explosive gas masses are displaced, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the movie Splatter an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the ancient genre thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising", an epic of the fighter.
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about by turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is made prisoner; he releases himself from his executioner and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after another. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal killing methods. When he is in a bad mood, he removes the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the brow says no word about its real name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, at the turn of one or two sentences some horrifying cries of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and celebrated in Scotland's incredibly beautiful mountain landscape, which is the setting of the Viking universe about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travellings.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a shame that they mutually exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn has been considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy relative to the drug dealer fierce and full of style, as a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantin, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the art and trial cinema.
Most art cinema sympathizers must experience horror in the face of the brain spreading all around and the intestines.
Action movie lovers are bored, when the brow embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to shut up.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" found no film distributors in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that earned some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
This is not about dialogues in this film, nor about coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
The viewer can't escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a gloomy soundtrack, but above all with an inseparable hatred that comes out of the heart of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands loyally next to the border, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
More than anything else, the dull hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies by turning into a warrior, is perhaps sent from the devil himself.
It represents rot, but perhaps also, only for those who are, in any case, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that one can hate or admire, which has for the purpose of appeasement, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious landscaping works
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications concerning a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone submit to the Agency's controls.
In the night of 5-6 September 2007 around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest city located nearby is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is contained in the IAEA documents, because it is about the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the lack of electricity.
According to a briefing by the U.S. intelligence services, the CIA, dating from late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby town, el-Kibar, would be well suited to producing plutonium, which would make atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video with blurred satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor prior to the destruction of the power plant which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building nearby, or even the interior of it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into operation, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombardment, little more information is available than at the time, and even, in time, the mystery thickens more and more.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built an El-Kibar reactor, but had little evidence to show that the country was developing "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "presumed reactor", even though they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Questioned about how he ensured that he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat from the United Nations gave only a laconic response in the summer by stating that the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians certainly rushed off the debris of the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical settlement of the terrain.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA received from a Member State satellite images of commercial providers showing the moment that followed the attack directly. It appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus argues that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the particle analysis, calling it unlikely.
Since then, damas has refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection at the El-Kibar site and refuses access to the wreckage of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps an obstinate silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister-in-Office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
For example, the investigation of this case has been dragging in length since June 2008 without a result being achieved and it "is becoming increasingly a serious credibility problem of the Agency", as recognized by a senior Western diplomat in service at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, which is ultimately a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that in order to achieve progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other facilities that must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have neither indicated which facilities they are here, nor what their function or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also by the name of the neighbouring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington identified these localities and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspect objects.
It is possible that it is located in a military base or directly next to it; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to IAEA inspectors from the three sites.
In Vienna, it is said that Syrians fear that the inspection group will actually be spies sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it is information provided by U.S. intelligence officers that draws the attention of the nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have taken shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped in order to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one facility could "serve fuel production".
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
However, there are plausible assumptions about the following fundamental questions: where uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed to make the bomb would have been separated later.
It is not known whether gravel, which could hide high-value traces, has been stored in all three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with land have disappeared, no one will have any information on the place of storage of the gravel.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria would have had the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from El-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
In recent analysis of satellite photos taken on behalf of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former IAEA inspector, Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Photos taken by satellite show, however, that Syria has undertaken tremor work at the three suspect sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began to demand access to these locations.
It may be a coincidence, but this did not help to rule out suspicion.
He said in the diplomatic community that the IAEA had spent several months developing a plan for inspections to be carried out there, which should allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets, and only time spent showed how much interest the inspectors were in this matter.
In the meantime, Damascus also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported in this case, for example, says Glyn Davies, the United States ambassador who has been speaking for a few months about what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The Director of the IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, certainly already spoke of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented in it have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, like this diplomat who gives thought: "To this it would be useful, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in Time of War
It's been bad since Angelina Jolie made her debut in summer as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it's a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing more is known about this story, but that is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the war in Yugoslavia.
The federations of Bosnian women immediately protested. In response, some shooting sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved in the last minute to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress. Jolie herself is a good-will ambassador of UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to meet with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must take place in Bosnia," Hasecic says.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario tells us quite a lot about his attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to withdraw the position of Goodwill Ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its scenario, granted a filming permit to Sarajevo after a few hesitations, but it is not known why it did not come after that.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of efforts that she has become aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She claims that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity for all parties to speak out.
However, it remains vague about content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: Lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
However, this is a big difference with the version "a rape victim falls in love with his executioner".
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, as Jolie says, is "unfair and based on incorrect information".
Now only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: By illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, everything's going well with the Irish again.
No sign of consternation.
This is why the local team overly dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy at the bottom of a loud music, trembling feet.
Baileyu-Pub from Cork in southern Ireland vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beer cups from the opposing team.
This strange show is called "Bierre-pong". The winner packs 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to attend in January in Las Vegas at the world championship of beer-pong.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle game to drink and the computer scientist reserved, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old man seeks to have fun, to turn away from the disturbing question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will lead hiring interviews in New Zealand.
"I feel a strange feeling," he says.
"The home country is so far away and I don't have a job."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she has obtained her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, her brother Colin now holds a position as a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island resembles tanners.
The experts of the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish people will soon leave their country.
They even expect 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are achieved, it will be a current of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish enjoyed great ease, grief now takes its place.
The economic crisis, however, is particularly affecting well-trained young Irish people who have experienced only moments of happiness so far.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's money in excess.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper widely publishes letters from readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything is drifting away."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunities, goes away and our country so a whole generation."
"The last to leave extinguishes the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a darker future as the government only throws dust into the eyes and offers no prospect of the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades hang on to one practical internship not paid to another.
She states that they are her greatest concern to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this theme positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" trade show, which offers comprehensive support on the theme "Working abroad".
"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," says the manager.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan, has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing more to be done in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector and Germany.
A fashion house just comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan only rarely visits his native country, as he participates in an additional job, so that he can complete the repayment of the credit contracted to build his home in the native country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says by crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I hardly live anymore."
It bursts out of a embarrassed laugh crossing the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of great brands are parked on the access routes.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by credit.
"These were moments of madness, without a doubt, money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid that everything will collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan ponders for a moment, recovers from hot tea and says: "I have no children to maintain and I am young; even everything goes through, I can go back to zero."
The building engineer doesn't like the complaints he's been hearing lately.
"No one should suffer from hunger, but our situation is not as dramatic as we once lived here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a moment is not what can happen worse, maybe that's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after spending seven years there and, in Ireland, life continued, quite simply."
This idea pleases Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and find out how life is happening elsewhere.
In his rankings, He already has a few years of work in London. That's why life should not be as easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is one more thing that worries him very much in recent days: the celebration to be held on the occasion of his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a good-bye party.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he says, drinking a long sip of beer.
"Good-bye, it still sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a good-bye evening, all relaxed, bringing together some friends, with some drinks and some games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows changes in attitude in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its principal institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, bringing down the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with how their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase of 25% in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's Parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but a sharp increase compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have shaken support for democracy.
While this has been successful during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have suffered only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and again declined this year to 32%.)
But mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
What is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
This is only the second time since the survey began, that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
Approximately 31% say that they or one of their relatives have been the victims of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); although their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (against 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered the country most influential by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the sinister and fearful country.
Voting boxes and new ballots were presented, ballots dispersed in the goutières, looting polling stations and intimidations.
The polling stations were running late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced following the January earthquake, wandered around to find a place to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favourites, denounced fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, regards the event as "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they "did not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are liable to René Préval, the outgoing unpopular president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second expected round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial appeal for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr.Célestin, who has little or no perceptible support from the voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reached the second round.
With an epidemic of cholera raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In fact, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards needed to vote were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a people's and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, of course, Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
Weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate from 20 points to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Mrs Fernández, visibly in mourning, that she would abandon or not abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to draw up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has plunged into disarray following the death of Mr Kirchner of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling peronist movement joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian struck one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to fight," the president said.
At present, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President even greater room for manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and the wage demands of trade unions see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which made falsifications of official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his civil servants say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high world prices for Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the growth boost following a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government entered into an agreement with bondholders who had refused a prior forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández sees to be edging towardss an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it has some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF monitoring, as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices, which resembles a prelude to the sanitation of INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is highly advocated.
When the Argentinians came back from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for it would have refluenced.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate her husband's many policies without noise.
A half-hour for China
Taiwanese voters have moved towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother located on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters presented themselves on November 27, or 70% of eligible people, to elect mayors and councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings vis-à-vis the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but that's right.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayors, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (DPP), which has focused on Taiwan's full independence, has won nearly 50% of all KMT votes by 45%.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in difficulty.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including tagging country trucks and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal outfits.
A mandatory mysterious assassination attempt has also been perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien, purely through his face, wounding him and killing a passer-by.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning the voters to the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking that the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
For example, the KMT tends to avoid beginning its ties with the government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP has also refrained from arousing the anti-Chinese feeling.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his Chinese policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in accordance with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to the cradle.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start with the beginning.
Better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he was wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocative advocate of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is making every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatist, not to fight the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have difficulty choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT must do a self-introspection.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite dizzying economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT said that his office and his local antennas would be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Appointments at Grammy Awards: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a selected surprise in the category "best new artist"
To do so at the request of a president, and people are required to know about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to take place at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a large-scale nomination in the category of the "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since its 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains somewhat mysterious but is consistent with the Grammy Award rules that an artist should not release more than three albums before the recording; this "establishes the public identity of this artist."
Its ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given its slightly engaging vocal style, its skilled hand of pop and funk and its Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line at Spalding compared to the fulgurating success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Award voters taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the voters of the Grammy Awards rightly honored "Historicity" by Vijay Iyer Trio in the category "instrumental album", a turn on a reinvigorating frieze of a recording that was one of the primary favorites last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, favored by the raucous voice of New Orleans and frequent guest at HBO's "Treme", was honoured in the contemporary jazz category; which also strongly leans towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, won some well-deserved recognitions in the great ensemble category; in competition with the rich Chamber-jazz by Billy Childrens Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his live byte's was a fine example of this bassist's democratic hand as group leader.
Grammy Awards nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Annual Awards include a mix of musical landscapes and composers from around the world.
In the lead of the nominations, we quote "Deus Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with ties to South California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony #4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer's Madolin Concerto based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in the league for a reward.
The classical appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choir and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical album are the Symphonys #3 and #4 of Bruckner of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium - the art of Castrati" featuring various artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of the Ars Lyrica Houston; "Lion's Love" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoé" by Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition count Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatement Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had its first at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concerto" of Dorman was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
Los Angeles composer said he had written the 15-minute work specifically for Mandolin performer Avi Avital, who played the concerto with Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of North African ranges and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Orchestra leader Pierre Boulez, 85, received an appointment in the category of orchestra performances, for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received an appointment are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only solist vocalists; here they are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman received an appointment for her recording "Racines: my life, my song"
The Temecula Mosque project was approved by the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Criticisms have taken hold of the project, claiming that it is promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday evening that the new religious centre was respecting local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahaïs, you mention him," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it, as an American citizen."
"This shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people pronouncing for or against the center, at the speaking time almost equally distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," one speaker wrote.
"This is another monkey planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including in Ground Zero, the site of the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her 135 - family congregation co-exists without incident in Riverside County for years, but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and would rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4,32-hectare site on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerant of arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, widens the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This body has double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or arsenic."
"That's why she is very special, even though she is far from being a truly "foreign" form of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the Arizona State University, co-author of the report in the online edition of Thursday of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, are able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of an alien life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, might not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Science, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," said Cockell.
It wasn't a random discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, which led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organizations have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough so it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and, in a way, erases the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
Researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of the Earth's existence, she says; thus, researchers have suggested that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways of forming life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," Foster said, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibit dogs were found in Compton
The other two exhibit dogs on four flights outside a motel in Bellflower were found, and the Los Angeles County Sheriffs announced it on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akitas and two corgis pembroke Welsh - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower motel, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening Wednesday, told Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in which neighborhood and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in an animal shelter in Downey County.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were healthy and safe, the authorities announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the coorgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of Japanese dogs, were missing until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the National AKC/Eukanuba Championship in Long Beach, where they intended to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other events scheduled in the days before the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba", Peek said in the Times Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour of almost a month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a puppy Boxer, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton spag - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left Akitas and Corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They kind of opened the windows, so the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the pickup at 6:00 on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM no longer waits for the final green light of the yard
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start again at zero.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially rented on Thursday the "pre-packaged" plan by creditors that about $5 billion of debt would be erased; opening the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With Thursday's decision that the plan meets the requirements of the United States bankruptcy code, there are no legal obstacles left before MGM to replenish itself under the supervision of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general directors of what will be a light studio.
Staff will be reduced to approximately 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility to fund new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself faces $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was engaged to advise management on how to place its finances as it did not have the means to pay interest amounting to $300 million per year.
In August, Director General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a remedial expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and satisfy the more than 140 creditors in the studio took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, auctioning attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay an additional 2 billion from which creditors were seeking.
In the spring of this year, it was necessary to do everything again while the MGM team had begun to work on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially exits bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive several million dollar premiums for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have collected $375 000 per month for their corporate management services, will receive a $4 million success award.
Barber and Birnbaum intend to relaunch the production of MGM, which only released one film this year, and create an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must enter into a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to fund its share of these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Tech Toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful toy this year is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jumping strings, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club from BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are usually fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known such ones, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the button battery toys are on the rise, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are a few recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise specified.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are stuffed toys the size of a pig from India who sing a note when you press them on the belly.
A pressure equals a note, and a second one makes it possible to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start to press, you can't stop.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can dance lunarly thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel block.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computer-based educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a backpack filled with questionnaire game cards designed to transform a ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve binder.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for 3 to 7 years) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card entry that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks just bigger than a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before the time runs out, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for 6 to 12 years old) which includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credits at Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
These may be roulette skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($ 10, for 5 years and more) is the last button battery microbots.
The false beastiole moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage into our dog's mouth.
Bringing a softer side to law enforcement in China
Tang Shenbin saw a place in the city as an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nervous loads, by issuing orders in a low voice with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan - imposing public order officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence - to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Be right!"
"Be sharp!"
Show them, he says, "What do pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely passed adolescence in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-colored jackets and pants, were staring at you.
Four pairs of black heel shoes, aligned to the rule.
Four perfectly perched neat hats on the top of hair attached by a knot striped in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
A city has required that all new recruits have a higher education degree.
The province of Guangdong exchanged the grey-green uniforms against a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced them by the strong way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the colporteur repacked his business and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, chose to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in urban areas of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, size and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have difficulty attracting attention to this underground urban brigade in China
And for the sake of it, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media portray the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in the province of Humei beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them by dispersing a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and put online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without issuing blood.
This year in Shanghai, a pastry colporteur was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available online, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street vendors.
"Chengguan marked the government," lamented China Daily last year, a national publication, after a controversial one on tactics.
The paper called for "true cleanup."
Sceptics say the approach is far away.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real jobs or were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district announcement required female candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five features of the face in the right order."
They must be larger than the average size, either 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is compulsory.
The officers stated that the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are appropriate; they are the size, weight, face traits, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "inner qualities."
The Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district management office of the city, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement for the order of facial traits.
What that means is beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, persons with disabilities or disfigured persons should not apply.
"We can't let a boxer or a boss come to serve here," says Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the enhancement of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked for a disillusioned look.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old midget colleague, says: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They did not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they nurture greater career ambitions than simply hunting sellers in the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen walking merchants who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many small breads or tofu bowls as possible before taking the leak.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you several times!" said Ms. Xu when a seller ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning his bike-carret with noodles.
The officers describe their functions rather as monotonous than arduous.
"It's about the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers' property.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exhibitions of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, revolted after the spread of false rumors that Chengguan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen officers and officers from the Chengguan were injured, 14 government vehicles were overthrown or fired.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid square Baoguang, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle was screaming at the scandal.
An iron arm of 15 minutes followed before the police officers, with a sinister face, crossed a line to their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 and over - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li Said with a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the public that starts."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Department of Justice raised the criminal charges against Senator John Ensign arising from a case involving an assistant from an old campaign and his efforts to obtain lobbying work for the wife's husband, announced on Wednesday the honourable senator's lawyers.
The decision put an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal surrounding his case became the major national headlines last year and adversely affected his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The honourable senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "reported that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to hold any charges against him in this matter."
The Department of Justice has refrained from commenting on this matter.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice that there would be significant evidence that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the honourable senator's affair with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for a year by law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethical experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to be in contradiction with the so-called ban on the rotating door of lobbying.
According to evidence made public, "there seems to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and violate the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from an investigation by the government.
Although the department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-level setbacks by its public integrity section, including last year's decisions to abandon prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take the weapons," said Melanie Sloan, the Director General of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government official can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Senior Counsel for Mr.Ensign, stated in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice on Monday and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to persuade them that the honourable senator, as his office reaffirmed on Wednesday in a statement, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made at the prosecutor's office.
"I'm not comfortable getting into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission stated that it did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money was everything but a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada corporation that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he "martelized" the Ministry of the Interior on a matter in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the Transport Secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to fight for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the honourable senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
About half a dozen of them were typing away in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent reports of horrible testimonies every minute via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said that there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape trial and the children attached to their bed in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three Cheshire family members in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed elements with the court that outline appeal arguments, which may be in the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - have created a " circus atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by the passions of the public.
The request could prompt appeal judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I experienced this during this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in courtrooms undermines human rights at a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State, lavishly rejected the claims in the judgment rendered last week, claiming that the media were "sanely controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been driven by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
Courts of appeal have for decades recognized that media coverage of well-known cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a judgment dated 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States annulled the conviction of an osteopath in Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The fugitive".
Some lawyers stated that the appeal courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the means of communication of courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue claims that some appeal judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is only one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which is likely to be discussed for years, which delays execution.
Defence counsel also states, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered harm when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Defence counsel claims that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of the prosecutors, and that he abused pressure for a verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to deliberate on a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments on the effect of intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for the position of governor and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the computer media were constantly attracting the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily bulging of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "resembling nothing that had been seen here before, in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that the instant news was more incendiary than the releases delivered more slowly was a luddist view that would impoverish the Court's policy of media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers stated that appeals courts were often attracted by the arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that had overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, represented Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Can civilization bring the divides closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civilization broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a warning sign of genuine bipartite cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the early return to partisan struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders has produced no breakthroughs on the major issues that need to be addressed during the "bottle duck" session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to score points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the committee on the President's deficit was equally civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide, but which, however, still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a period of trial and mutual testing with a view to obtaining signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the Tuesday meeting and the subsequent comments of the participants revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too profound to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
In terms of taxation, spending, health care or rights, both parties remain miles away.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in tone," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration, now next to the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the election.
The elections stir up partisan passions and then they fail.
That's good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "bottle duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve a part or the whole of it, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, perhaps only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House, more optimism is based on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on "boitous duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once the things that have to be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civilization would lead to true cooperation.
"I consider most of what is going on between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow boxing compared to the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons for this are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and to the tea voters who contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, raising retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their view, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had difficulty reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected representatives, suggesting that there is little reason or willingness to compromise on tax issues, at least today.
Galston foresees two phases in the fights between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan confrontations, as Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care; and then be followed by a period of greater bipartite cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
Those who will be judged to be in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are bigger today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties saw 2010 as a simple prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But much more effort will be needed on both sides to find a common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Disclosed American documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and sends to the Kremlin some of the bribes and the protection money it collects, reported the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service carry out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They raise money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of power" - takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on his website on Wednesday by Wikileaks.
The note is based on sources whose names have been removed.
It was written while Yuri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but there have since been few traces of cleaning.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these charges.
In September, he declared the following to a Russian television channel, when he was interviewed on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's to throw, it's anything."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupted; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy report; and it is unusual to imagine that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime led some people to call it "dysfunctional" and to claim that the government worked more like a kleptocracy than a government," according to the Embassy's note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (the term used in the criminal/mafia world that literally means "roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in the Moscow criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is raising the money of the largest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understood that it was better to obtain protection from MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"This is why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high."
The note states that, although the collection of money is extended, protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption but admitted little progress.
The embassy note sends reports of men who bring suitcases, probably full of money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's think tank Indem.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He is not part of a political class because he does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the costs of corruption across Russia would amount to more than $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the note of the American Embassy, which was only made yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow's failures, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that WikiLeaks' documents could be a fabrication and reacted with anger to the statements that US diplomats had released by calling him Batman and rapprochementing Medvedev from Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he says.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that it would be realized with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with decrepit concrete walls of poor quality, the director of the secondary school of Anlong Veng mentioned the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here likes Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally challenged at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led by the United Nations, handed down its first sentence concerning a former Khmer Rouge member, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
Faced with this evolution of the situation, anxiety has increased among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge of Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are resentments and fear among the old Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the diet became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overturned the Pol Pot U.S. government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements went in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrillas at their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a suite at Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defuse the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans have plunged into black poverty, common to the rural regions of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic of the movement.
Although some Khmer Rouge elite officers have retained their positions as local leaders in exchange for having laid down the weapons, they are low-grade, unskilled farmers.
"These people received very little follow-up after capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbued with the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in a context where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to support our own needs."
The Khmer Rouge Court in progress has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court should begin the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Red Minister.
The court's mandate is to try the senior leaders and the principal perpetrators of the crimes, but he did not say whether he continued beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations were directed towards 64-year-old Im Chaem, a former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have died.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work to the field near his wooden house on pilotis, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
While the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there is more prosecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court pursued several suspects; although experts and historians contested this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect broken pieces," he says.
"We have to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he came back with the book at home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They do not trust because they do not know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Yet, the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek Mountains, a path, invaded by weeds and sprinkled with plastic bags, leads to a black soot rectangle, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone saleswoman on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who was incinerated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she says.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day, she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its military-grade uranium stock
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decison is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world
The agreement was released in a joint communiqué issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov here on the margins of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to renounce highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarus research centre.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the remainder of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to an official who mentioned the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the question.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to offer an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This proves to me that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security group.
Clinton described the "very significant, important step" agreement made by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexandre Lukashenko said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium," said Mr. Lukashenko.
"It's our product... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, however, expressing an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and disposed of, said officials.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, according to the officials.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low enriched uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization has been implemented to build confidence", leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bienawski, a head of the Department of Energy specializing in the Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates from the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of the harsh repression by Lukashenko of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential for improving bilateral relations; and indispensable for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has not objected to CIA flights
The government has not objected to CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda in the direction of Guantanamo across Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks in the daily El País, which add that the first vice-president of the government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed "to demonstrate that they were exercising adequate vigilance over foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe that accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to some dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report had "surprised the Government of Zapatero out of the game" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They only want to be informed" to avoid being "take them without," reports Aguirre in a cable.
The incumbent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even though, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
In January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown its concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the Ambassador of the United States and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid comments from a burning rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly benefit from any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she says.
The parishioner who went to confessions complained in a network of the "accuracy" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Galician Terror"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as soon as she was a little girl, she contacted a cousin and at least a friend; both of them from Noia, the village of La Coruña from which she was a native.
The messages date from 2008.
To hear them, we need to know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elect was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring municipality.
With him, she lived together for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the child stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idyllic fractured, they separated.
In March 2008, she was in Minorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and upset about the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed like a good thing to him, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not to have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she's talking about a mobile message she just got: "I want you to come home this month or give me an address to send the child."
Ella complains: "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home," she claims.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'll only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to report to a job so I don't lose it."
She explains that if everything went well, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person if that person is not my mother," dubious intent, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When she tapped it, it was assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and had allegedly been murdered on the 10th, died.
"César is happy on the one hand, but he is not happy on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and this place likes him a bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Majorca.
"He will go there (the child) a few hours in summer and so I save a little money from the babysitter."
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know which videos to email, you see, when he wants to, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another one: "The child is fine, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's making money for me."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the jail liberator."
"Galician Terror (Epigraph)."
The last man who lived with her, a vigilante, declares his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything happened so she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Monica entered the prison in Palma yesterday, from the centre of judicial detainees in Minorca.
Lawyer Carlos Maceda explained that she does not remember how the facts had happened, "and she also did not intend to harm the minor."
Before she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and putting her body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor have requested a psychiatric trial.
The members of the People's Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats in Congress.
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MPs recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training obtains in these committees normally double the number that it receives in the Catalans.
For example, the Catalan populars obtained 610,473 votes at the 2008 generals, while at the 2006 autonomics, they had obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC got 384,091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, desired by a misappropriation of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, the analysts of this training calculated that, if there were general elections, the PCP could go from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose no more than 9 MPs (it does 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - he has three now - while ICV would retain one MP or win one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal committees, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and populars agree that PSC could lose the city halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not get the majority either, nor would they get the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fanciful that this formation loses its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP only recorded a 500-voting difference from PSC, including Mayor Angel Ros, maintaining very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
Popular people have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven inmates in Barcelona, Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerians detained by officers of the General Information Commission of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including "Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the author of the Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" has "weakened" Al Qaeda's falsification apparatus at the international level and "thus, its operational capability".
The investigators estimate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or were falsified and then distributed to groups that included the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network operated in Europe, that is why in the investigations participated, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, that is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days similar blows to that recorded the night of Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddic Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another was carried out in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who were running the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly flew from tourists the passports that met the conditions marked by the name "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents were to be on behalf of young men aged between 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connect detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after by the integrants of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police seized a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend the tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign and which simply give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address to half of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan populars arrived at the appointment with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise abstain in the vote of the investiture.
From a possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are being held in Catalan key.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an investiture "all sovereignist and independentist discourses should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bets to make the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomous administration thin and the elimination of the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of Mas's investment negotiations will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric states that the dead were not due to the "lack of measures"
Owners of the centre of Olot do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The managers of the geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Gerone) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people he was responsible for in the interval he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, accompanied himself by the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to charge the person responsible" for the dead but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected the night nurse's criminal activities in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that from that day on he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - who suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures can at no time have been the cause of what happened".
Counsel for La Caritat added that "in this case there is only an indication of imprudence on the part of any other person other than the accused."
The person already named the "Angel of Death" confessed before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by injecting him with an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control access to medicine by the centre's staff.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But laboratory tests will clarify whether Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or instead he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the period 12-17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in her visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat that "markets should not underestimate our responsiveness."
The peripheral differentials have closed to force and the actions of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make a mistake, and the euro has barely recorded an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way that it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by fences of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be late to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB called on us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining.
Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, it is hoped that the current liquidity measures "at least until March" will be extended and the sale will continue to be sold at quarterly auctions with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, which God helps us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they stated that they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and they collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have dropped 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures for Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are available in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has not yet had sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a place of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The dual Trichet and ZP effect explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the response of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key bid for a three-year obligation that will be benefited by the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will be resolved with a strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for an Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million cash available, three times as much as March, to very expensive types and they cut access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "other than being, to appear".
Courage, we can get out of it!
The President of Eulen will challenge Vega Sicilia's council requested by his sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers it "no law", the legal council of El Enebro the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management organs of the owner firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control on one side of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company business services does not seem to be willing to give in to his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors in the shareholders' meeting of 18 January this year whose challenge is recorded in the Register of Trade and Corporations.
El Enebro's judicial council for the next 16th, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, reopened the box of tunas in the Álvarez family.
The use of the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal of the plaintiffs his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly Frauding the Law and by abusing the law, to validate and correct the radically null assembly on January 18", according to his official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the assembly to be challenged once it has taken place, considering that it is "nothing of full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully that the magistrate convenes an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless asks usufruct of 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for challenge for which there is not yet a date indicated.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his story in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
In the first moment, no one took into account the options of a new stable that had just arrived, despite the ascending trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on Fernando Alonso's Ferrari triumph.
Without diminishing the skill as the champion's pilot, German Sebastien Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine to propel his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational company has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
This is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far removed from high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly chains for manufacturers from all over the world, energy stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or the most famous Nissan commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens Industrial Division, explains the fact that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 plant allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In Red Bull's team, 180 young high-skilled professionals are working today who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications to the bolides.
Siemens's leader explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's pellets except the engine, which is Renault's exclusive responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can shift from virtual reality from simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the sole limitation of this insanity of technological development there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech plant to create and produce its pellets in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that's going on there is considered top secret.
The staff for this duty have 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1 is probably the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and no reputation.
The factory's technology director, Steve Nevey, says five years ago it could be said that R & D in the case of racing cars accounted for 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of success, while pilots bring 15% of value added.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science because "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will install in two years 20 clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice-president Helena Herrero gave an example of the redesigned store located on Barcelona's Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group prepared a plan to deploy 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, including the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first opened were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the Barcelona one being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of the exclusive furniture of shops (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that this is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in buying, assisting, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pioneering pilot program that solves the potential problems of HP's computer equipment as a guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'flying' one million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it provides for a collapse of interest margins, which will be partly offset by increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million particular customers, his task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way forward for the next three years and can thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 which will hold a three-year maturity.
The objective, apart from surviving without having to resort to FROB's public subsidies, is to earn a market share by capturing a million new customers - 700,000 if one deducts those who can get out of the bank - its great task to be accomplished, because so far this bank had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the particular customer.
This year he has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same thing, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalise this year its Optima master plan, establishes four years ago, even if initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for one more exercise.
Clients who let the savings banks escape will be their main goal.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking case, he stressed.
And even if he thinks that the liability war - which penalizes the margins - is shrinking, the price of the risk premiums that banks and cash pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity are already moving at the credit price to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure on credit."
"We didn't tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CinqueDías on November 22 and 27.
He also admitted that the trend of the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "we will ask for larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He claims that capital needs "increase enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter red numbers.
And he mentions that FROB can replace the market in raising funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that we cannot issue, but contrary to what happened in June, we can obtain short-term financing through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the caisses
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When the Spanish savings banks' merger process began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in the first phase and that they would reserve for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been carried out, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the group of Banca Cívica is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most have been achieved completely; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation too," the leader said.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process is carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out within the deadlines set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
"The passage of 45 caisses with an average of 28,500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is an unparalleled trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to conform to Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of rather unhappy opinions about the slow pace of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of serosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remind that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year".
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world and has attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "go at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector took advantage of the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin opted to remain in the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary in tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or abolition of 426 euros of assistance to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins with Chancellor Angela Merkel's criticism of her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which is shocking to the fact that it maintains the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, incorporated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even though now it seems of science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, fiscal rigour, fines to the countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (tax rigour plans and fiscal stability) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow from the Central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published one were against Greece's rescue.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel once again expresses a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time obliging private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the following months, we should be witnessing the Union's reform process that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take steps with which we can not agree too much, from that date on the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in default and, in that case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany points out that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just about extending the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're being asked is much harder.
And what he must absolutely not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that today's turbulence will lead to greater tranquillity.
And that we can grasp the opportunity we were given, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, we have opened the way to the thesis that we must put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that are envisaged, it cannot be ruled out that of abandoning a monetary zone too crowded with less serious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us about it.
Sport and fraud of the law
The ruses similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
The horrid expulsion in principle by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League caused a lot of ink to flow on the anti-sportive character of such behavior and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, just a few minutes before the end of the game (which their team already won clearly), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually become the leader of its group, the two players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next game of the Auxerre Dam game and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned with two games the coach of the team, José Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, if not more frequent in the football world.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that appeared in the case related is due to the fact that this had as protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his anthem displays nobility and honor and who on past occasions has sentenced to a fine to his players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds one more episode to his dilated history of hystrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour does not expressly prohibit by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is to say, whether with these actions we commit a fraud of law; because, in fact, they are actions respectful of the sports regulation, but seem to elude its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that understands the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put in jeopardy, that is, there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with the right game is to prevent the team of infringing players from benefiting unfairly from the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not conform to what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in hiding to try to avoid punishment, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the arbitrator.
They were waiting and they willingly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders gain from intentional misconduct.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not get an advantage in the same game either, because obviously the result of the action presupposes the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Of course, the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with some degree of indeterminateness, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from this, with this action the players perform a penalty game and move to the second cycle of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with one less than the first cycle.
So, climbing the steps, it's not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which is still part of strategic decision-making that promotes profit to the maximum of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), otherwise they chose rather the time when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without derailing the penalty or running away from it.
Even though the boundary between genius and lawlessness is widespread, on this occasion I think we've had a clear case of genius.
The controversy seems to me to be due to two factors: because there have been two self-expulsions and because of the way the Director transmits to provoke them.
The evil caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to pick up Christmas dinners for groups in NCB
The calendar dictatorship concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bull and lottery, when December comes also come back the dinners of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen ball for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have led to an offensive your prices adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincide the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To complete the accounting, this year's calendar (like the night of Saint Sylvestre falls on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, resulting to date in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 17th and 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying for their own pockets.
Whatever the situation is, they all ask for battle prizes, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauracía de Barcelona, Gaiète Farràs.
The employer's representative, now, does not dare predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices," he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the tranche around 25 euros has become majority in demand.
A survey of various institutions in the centre shows the collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they answered by adapting their menus to the economics, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has assumed more advance bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We did the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros", they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after having detected an increase in billing since the second semester and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
From the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment), his vice-president, Enric Gomà, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and claims that overall reservations are "animated", even if customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That is true, the hope for the festivities has not diminished, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is causing great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy of Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear programme.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
For example, the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report before the visit of former National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations in the territory under attack by the Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise is short and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferator and a reason for maintaining custody.
"Pakistan has to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev, of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
A dispatch from the Embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", supports the following: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it clear to the head that "the Pakistan Army must end with tacit support for terrorist groups".
Hunting for Wikileaks Leader
Obama will count a senior leader in the fight against terrorism to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track the movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have a certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, it is not new, otherwise it dates from November 20.
And the latter has nothing to do with the last leaking of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents from the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creative lawyer Mark Stephens assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
On the 20th, the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after having received the authorization of the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries received the indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give the arrest warrant of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red appeal as a clear path for arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement referred to Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the founder of the 39-year-old Wikileaks was willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video-conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security in Stalin.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends the innocence of her son -- Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he was not.
On Monday he gave an indeterminate interview to the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to U.S. graduates to spy on the UN in violation of the international treaties that the U.S. has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the application for resignation as ridiculous and absurd.
"I'm not sure why a guy's opinion with a web page should interest us," he said to CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a senior anti-terrorist leader, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's attempt to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate their funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance".
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to come back to his statements after saying that Assange would have to "be murdered."
"Obama should turn it into an objective and use an unmanned aircraft or something like that."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"He who is in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with eye-pins to the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the umpteenth internal revolt inside the ERC, with no north because of the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as its liar and that it absolutely cannot give him any headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
That's why Esquerra's leader will try to win his new critics with eyelashes that allow him to blind himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to pass a certain penalty vote on the president, they can do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "in Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to Carod require the president a little more than making his position available to the militia, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the Congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a sure fact.
The leader of ERC admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to make once and for all the organization capable of washing its laundry room with family.
In this line, the article that current advisor Josep Huguet has signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the Puigcercós ideologist, the holder of Innovation thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he pointed out two.
The first, "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, include new figures that come from Carod's Adept sector.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, he advocates a reform of the statutes that allows the holding of congresses through delegates elected by vote.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsion instructed the leadership to revise the assembly model at a specific congress of status reform.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time could be good to take it back and shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 executed in 2010
According to the State of Mexico's MILENIO, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders were these three women and the discovery of two cut bodies in Valle de México.
During the last month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases are that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlan, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the blow of thanks to the head, apart from the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
Very early in the morning on Thursday, on the four, the owners of communally exploited land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the thorax, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day later in Nezahualcoyotl, a 50-year-old gentleman was killed with eight shots when he was leaving his house to initiate garbage collection.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by an impact of a gunshot to the head each in the colony San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, a man's body was found on a lonely road to Colonia El Naranjo and under the body a bullet was found shot with a 25-caliber gun.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency corps carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán warned about the discovery of a corpse that was in Peña Colorada, hands tied behind and eyes blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound to his neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the Atizapán municipality of Zaragoza was reported, at the same time two death warning messages were discovered with the victims.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes settlement in Los Reyes La Paz municipality.
In a nearby colony we found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan was located which had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, agreed with a message that his executors had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots to the neck, a woman's lifeless body was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman were detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with his image.
By the end of the month, a man's body was found on the edge of a car in the town of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet strikes and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads wrapped up and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens to those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Centre of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first had been decapitated in the colony Cuchilla Ancón and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the officers found a bristol with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country in COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it maintained its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, said Su Wei, a representative of that country at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the coal trace and convert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in that area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives addressed with respect to greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities worked in a coordinated manner with government and local authorities to achieve energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction objectives.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both funded by the Chinese Government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Utilization Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of filament lamps by saving lamps, and another for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific advisor to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than we think.
For example, he explained, the per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make it a similar one by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN explained that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is legal.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is legal.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, Espino's expulsion is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address himself, if any, by making a complaint to the Order Commission of the National Council, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that National Action would be stronger after the internal elections on 4 and 5 December, where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach for local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that perhaps the council will be able to elect the best leader that National Action needs for the next three years, so it would give the "person determined by the council" priority.
"I'm completely quiet and open, I'd be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He planned that the party's re-launch in the past elections on 4 July would be reflected in the next fight, even though "it's not yet time to think about 2012."
"For the moment it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have made "a lot of hopes for them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the PRI to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that they come out of 'armoire'," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions such as those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no bulwark, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes the law on Twitter for undocumented students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," the American president tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today met at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," said Twitté Obama.
His short message maintains an open cyber link with a broader document that asks the public to immediately contact senators, because the vote on legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding continue.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax problem was resolved an agenda could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be resolved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The Leader of the Senate Democratic Majority, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he would request a "closure vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Law would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, remained in that country for the last five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the help of a large number of Republicans, at times when the partisan organizations of the project are playing an intense lobbying role to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of office of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
While the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the larger barriers to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put our finger on the wound
The second stage of the pleasures of the language was a walk in which the participants spread the narration
"The sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what do we hope of me?" asked the guest writer Luisa Valenzuela to open the second stage of the pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of her question (for another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound "...we put in embarrassment", the Argentine writer gently threw to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which they participated Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa as the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "pleasure" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighs relieved and concludes: "On the wound I could only know that it is actually open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be closely related to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaragua's Sergio Ramírez also presented a lovely narrative that he called "Eloge to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at some point discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he spoke of a famous enchantress who touched clouds, brought back people who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that turned to speak America, the great news that had had from the beginning its own chroniclers and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the narratives of the conquering captains.
"Some people who invented us all (the writers) mocked false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a bad way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that even lacked modesty."
Nevertheless, he stressed, "crazy and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, we no longer know what part of the narration belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is actually called the 'Tradition of Cervantes'.
"It's because of his legacy that we are told."
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the invitation of the FIL with its round table He owes to the wound.
The Cuban-Portuguese woman has put hers on the great plague of social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes about trafficking and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, noting that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of commitment between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also emphasized "it must on the wound of the writer engaged".
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times putting the finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting us to regain the sense of writing.
Romano hunting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he had highs and lows in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are in addition two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, which find between them a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he had highs and lows in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series, even though so far he has not put in the thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentinian eventually consoled himself with the sub-champion medal, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santist strategist arrived at his first final as a coach in the 2002 Open Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with a total result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Cloture he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and that was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament again against the Diablos, Rubén again suffered a setback, because his team made an equal 2-2 match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty series he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to separate himself from the evil one in order to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the helmsman when asked what his weaknesses would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can take is that until the referee blows the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never seek to arrive at the series of penalties, we try to end in the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish of holding the title in our hands, hands it has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we no longer arrive in this situation".
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
People need to go to Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011 the visa processing procedure at the Embassy and Consulates of the United States will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to appear at the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have some advantages for applicants, including the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for the processing of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The seeker will make a single payment covering all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visa will not have to present themselves to an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only present themselves to the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and take their fingerprints.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra $26 fee.
For more information on the new visa application procedure, please visit the following page: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletins/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The United States Space Agency has quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for beings living in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured that she would present who would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", which led to speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures like us and in hostile environments that we thought were uninhabited and put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if its living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that we thought was too venomous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, this proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from that we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by the geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest satellite in Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergence and Patron 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just settled when in the Congress there appeared an opposing bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tonned' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we initiate 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four MPs, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Executive Board chaired by PANiste Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these reforms in an institutional way constitute political marginalization on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the pattern from a political will and if they do not, they will again be enslaved by both parties and in this way the opposing coalition will end.
"Throughout here (the opposing coalition), that's what I'm looking at, because we're excluded from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow, he continued, that the Congress, after being monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is an eternal bipartisanism in Congress."
To begin with, this group begins with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, has abounded the Convergent.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that now the Congress has turned into a 'butin' between two, referring to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the MP's personality, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave by cupular agreements out to 5 who will probably be 9 MPs, now to the five that we see, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform that they have made, that they have decided, we are outside and we do not agree with that reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Town Hall of Mazatlan pays another cheque to the owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 miles to Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this one, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company is 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, the last check number 9258447 was issued on 16 November for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in concept of "liquidation of accounts suppliers".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, as anticipated by the Act when a business is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after 25 July Northwest had published a revision of the cheques that the City Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipe paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be treated
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in bad condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of Zona Dorada's Association of Traders, recalled that they have repeatedly called for the image of the destination to be treated and new activities to replace others that tourists find bad.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come to walk there and they see disorder and avoid close shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know how much money we lose, elsewhere they didn't do the work for so long and without proper planning."
Hoteliers José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"The city hall will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and not just doing the corrective," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area we must maintain it, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Hall must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, as for example Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlan.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends not only on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the necessary attention and this type of fact underlines something that is well known to all, the maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlan is urgent, as they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that have to connect with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Happily Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that we should first order, clean and put on-line to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP requests results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
The Mazatlan business sector is seeking a dignified and free-of-agreement labour legislation between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is being convulsed and confronted with major problems.
Yesterday we installed the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 MPs from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergence and one from PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
"We hope that Members will actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to guard their own interests and turn into carnival masks of rulers and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor makes progress.
"We will ensure that they do a decent and especially committed work with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotel Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces by seeking the economic growth of the State, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators give him the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and that it is incongruous as an important economic activity that generates foreign exchange and investment and that competes directly with agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that resources need to be classified into detonating tourism projects that help to make the state secure and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for a wise king.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to accomplish their illusions, because their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day by day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' for sale on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster truck' and for his 8-month-old brother Jesús Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, my son', because he was very expensive', remembers Cayetana with sadness.
For older children, who were at school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, shoes size 12; Isaías, 10 years old, shoes size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, shoes size eight.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make reality the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the campaign On Search King Mage, giving a toy or money at the reception of Northwest.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and production equipment have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for Quebec Security.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests," said Mr.Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Module of the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Board took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservative bill, which the government believes should address the problem of ships loaded with illegal migrants, is obviously going to be defeated when the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the proposed bill, which would allow for the holding of up to one year of any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Chief of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because he was targeting the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," said Duceppe.
NDP immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, rejected from the back of her hand criticisms that her party was not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
"New Democrats agree to take action against smugglers and this is what we do through another bill, the C-35," said Chow.
"We don't support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," said Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians say massively to MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country as a paillasson."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence in its bill, which could have led the country to elections should it be rejected.
One Conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that every MP who opposes would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, contends that this idea does not date yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation of New York on this matter as early as January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Yet, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Police Services of Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for the pequestrian public safety critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement as "a rabbit out of a hat" and a "brillated solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence over the possible future unity.
"You'll see the result when we announce it, does he just say."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSC, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
"The more Mr. Charest resists not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and I that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is Jean Charest's resignation," says Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To overcome this impasse, he therefore suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to broaden the mandate of the Auditor General," he says.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, thus enabling him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squadron is not the only project in the Charest government cartons.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments related to this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit the biker groups, even if the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Highly monitored rivers
Several streams remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another slip would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road broke down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
More than 20 to 40 millimetres of rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the region.
The areas north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
As these precipitations must be added to the snow melt already accumulated in some areas, there is concern that several streams will overflow.
Flood alerts were issued on Wednesday evening by the Quebec Civil Security for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and the Oak, in Lotbinière, were flooded and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has led to the overflow of some lakes in Saint-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was carried away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes has resulted in the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil security remains on an alert and closely monitors the situation, said Security Advisor Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec Crue Forecasting Centre on Wednesday issued strong crue warnings for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, the Achigan, Batiscan and the Wolf.
Partially blazed dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Radio Television Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial remarks on social assistance and Haitians as well as on his rough language on the air.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some of the statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, improperly negative representations of Haitians and coarse language that is not suitable for broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two individuals who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Common Front des personnes aides sociales du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the program were inaccurate.
The facilitators must present solid rather than misleading information.
With regard to suicide, host Stéphane Dupont felt that suicide was a cowardly gesture.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont noon" have dealt with a sensitive subject in an equitable and appropriate manner."
So no blame was held in his place.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then engaged in a media face-to-face that had elicited many reactions.
CHOI's facilitator stated that he had made no donation to help Haitians because one could not know with certainty that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension on it."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM broadcaster collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during peak hours within three days.
A King of Kung-fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special journey.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs on the world's tatami and ringes looking for new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, Zemmal explained, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, since for those who don't like the ground game in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the man who works as a security officer and as a clerk for UPS has just given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship from October 23 to 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"Currently, I am preparing to go to China for the San Shu World Cup."
"The fighters who finished among the first four in the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the fifth place tournament, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I will be first this time or next year!"
The "without shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punches and feet, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
The duels originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned fighter from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has to hold only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious competition in China," explained the friendly gaillard."
"It's kind of the equivalent of Stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, did he analyze."
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other in order to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without invitations to tender
Hydro-Québec has voluntarily awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium made up of BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor companies that obtained the most important, that of the stewardship of the project, for a sum of $295 million without invitation to tender.
This consortium called Energy Stewardship was established in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Stewardship consortium awarded the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing higher prices.
"It's the new way to do collusion and bring down competition."
"That is to say that people, instead of doing this secretly, now do it openly," said President Sylvain Simard yesterday in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said that it was difficult to see how the public interest could be served in that way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau replied in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was collusion with this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she said, arguing that the PQ had been "bad" and "lacked rigour."
She said that "it would be the least of things" that the PQ apologizes.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The construction site is in progress and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition game acting; there was negotiation.
The consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the consortium formula in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of the Québec Business Register allows more than 200 consortia to be counted, some of which appear to be permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
With respect to the Energy Stewardship Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay has been responding to specific labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding in a special way since the 1970s."
The major owner of the Eastmain Project, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (SEBJ), gave an explanation that highlighted the fact that the project's stewardship contract was granted voluntarily.
"If you go on tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory deal and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's people's competence," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Consortium Energy Stewardship is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consulting contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has consolidated 22 contracts, Génivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention its participation in Energy Stewardship.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Stewardship Energy contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau let it go that the QP is also linked to those firms that "finance it" before stating that it was rather its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The label "green" does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in equitable brands and eco-certifications to guide their choices.
Pis, even if he bathes in a media universe where messages in favour of more responsible consumption pull, he deplores a lack of credible information, which he even calls a brake on his commitment, says the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measuring tool developed by the Consumer Observatory responsible for Sherbrooke University.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are considered eco-responsible, the Barometer says.
In the same vein, politicians' discourse on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be essential to stimulate this pan of consumption currently driven by nearly one-third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious nature of the information would calm the fires of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers also say they are suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services they are seeking to put into their hands.
On another note, consumers were nearly half in 2010 to have changed their habit and, above all, changed their brand of one or more products to meet their belief.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases from local merchants and favoured the purchase of food products grown in their area, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the responsible consumer index has reached 64 out of 100 for this year - the Homo consumerus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
But his social and ecological awareness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers reported using public transport or advocating carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which has just taken its first cliché.
A State loan to buy eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Angus Society and the Parallel, agrees to collaborate, but only with a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, who hoped for a seven million dollar donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on St. Lawrence Boulevard by giving him his full film vocation, did not get what they demanded.
The government agrees to get involved in the file, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would be less than the original expectations, which could be a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of sources from the State Offices.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests have since been reviewed downwards.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who piloted the eXcentris file.
He sent him a final report about ten days ago.
But the counter-proposal of the firm reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the gift of the State must really be ruled out.
It should be recalled that the Association des propriétéurs de cinémas et de cinéparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the State in support of the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to fund real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several stakeholders in the community called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of ceans, for ten years carried the author's cinema to the end of his premises of the complex after having financed his own construction, which could justify an exemption from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is crying out in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to loyalize its clientele.
The Angus Society and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private fundraising campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, continues to broadcast films with eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February by designing Xavier Beauvois' beautiful film Men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
New U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lift the veil of what the U.S. considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians to the Americans, but at the same time betrays their sense of superiority towards Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government to get its budget adopted in 2009!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out on the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to put itself under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the midst of the federal election campaign, tells how much the United States is not one of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great surprise of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offered a few explanations for the situation.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may be a condition for Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of daily life rather than bringing this election to the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The ambassador understands all the less the "absorbing silence" that both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote."
The other expression of this sense of importance reads in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Ottawa's business manager, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government in the early February vote of confidence in the federal budget, by which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion," says Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast at CBC are returning from the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O programs, in which there are subtle references to Maher Arar, the No-Fly-List, or kidnappings for CIA muscular interrogations.
Another cable reports that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of "case-by-case".
At the end of the meeting, is it written, "he gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we note that the spirits are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC's waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "killed."
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Refurbish Lighting
Yesterday in Cancún, the United Nations proposed a plan for the renovation of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction that corresponds almost one third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in line with the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to have adopted in Cancun to offset the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to yesterday's plan, if incandescent bulbs that still monopolize from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHGs emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of global fleet emissions.
Last year in Copenhagen, major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should shift overall GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But we will have to subtract 5 Gt from this balance sheet in order to stabilize by 2020 the increase in climate to 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of energy dissipates in the form of heat and the remainder, or 5%, produces light.
With fluocompact bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this need for energy is reduced twice again.
Fluocompact bulbs last from an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, like those launched by Philips this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emit very little heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have posted reserves for fluocompact bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact bulb, but rather coal thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce waste electricity in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire awaits the announcement of election results in nervousness
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the expiry of the deadline.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," said a spokesman for the head of the United Nations."
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to exercise responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission allowed the deadline of Wednesday midnight to pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's election.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the President of the CIS had told television that the commission "continue to work" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied on Wednesday in the world so that the CIS finally proclaimed the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former Forces nouvelles rebellion (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian President, said that the intimidation of the voters practiced by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the former President from voting.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's complaints were retained by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who denies any connection to the former rebels, found the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he claimed victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that making a complaint to the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to crown the reunification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished at the top of the first round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% with overseas departments), showing seasonally adjusted data (CVS) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of unemployed is 2.631 million in metropolitan areas.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate is up by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has further deteriorated, with a further rise in the unemployment rate, to 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 point over three months, +0.5 point over one year) and 25% by including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
Seniors experienced a slight rise in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolitan areas (+0.2 points over three months as well as over one year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only 25-49 years of age benefited from stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, on the other hand, continues to do so and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini examined and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, leader of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was screened and found at Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini was examined for abuse of social property, diversion of funds and public property, imprisonment, active corruption, trafficking in influence and detention of ammunition, says her lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain himself to him about all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it is another thing to prove them," said AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS strong man in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, had, through his lawyers, to pass on to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also screened on Wednesday evening and collapsed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but run the dumps he had to run.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he never knew about them, said Mr Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of Aubagne's agglomeration services, was examined on Wednesday for diversion of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial supervision with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain the facts that he is accused of."
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his liberty," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been screened and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with judicial supervision for two of them, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General of Cleanness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "influence trafficking and passive corruption".
Two officials from Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being examined for "subtraction and diversion of public property by a person in charge of a public service mission", and for "complicity of diversion of public funds".
Finally, Alexander Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "receipt of abuse of social property".
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr.Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently found in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect their companies have been used to launder money from big banditry.
The investigation is carried out in the framework of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the survey, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne and some cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", held the opinion in haleine in France, alerted diplomacy, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to Americans, going to give them advice for the treatment of their own hostage crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not had as its counterpart the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by American justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they put under a cruel light the way the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President, Bashar Al-Assad, had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it wasn't.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French Comments on how to manage hostage cases".
Elysée's advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, met with US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forcibly detained nationals to Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "continuously hammer" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocent," "immediate release."
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more as the Iranians ask you not to."
For, after attempts to discuss through discrete channels, "the silence will not settle anything", the Iranians are "masters in dilatory maneuvers".
Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day she takes refuge at the French Embassy) "will require a large amount of money to be paid to Iranians" (230,000 euros of bail).
And he reports that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future stop another of the some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose United States claims extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, is released in Paris, upon a judge's decision.
The American Embassy, like many observers, questions this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of equipment for the nuclear program, Majid Khakavand's expansion is a bad news.
Has France accepted a trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he said, not only "was completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the guard of seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judicial decision", he notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under "close" supervision of the French intelligence services.
Elysée's advisor composed a telephone number, hung up, then informed the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée did not spare its efforts, by means of press releases and "fleets" organized in the media, to suggest that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad played an "important" and "influent" role as "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that manipulation bears fruit as several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions the "blitz" media of French officials.
On what is so much "gratitude" expressed towards Mr Assad, the Embassy in Paris asks.
"Despite their laudable statements, French officials in private recognize that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The paper then looks at the reasons why the Elysée had to pay for this fiction.
The intense communication effort "to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria", he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "show Syria what praises it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also "to sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows that from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier told him: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for Korean youth past midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a "Cendrillon" law that will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people under 16 years of age, said representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play at these games all night and then have trouble studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the ministerial head in charge of the bill.
The online games will again be available at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit their daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request them, added the manager.
It will also make available to people who demand it free software that allows to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
Global 2018-2022: Fifa designates organizing countries
In full torment due to suspicions of corruption, the Fifa Executive Committee designates Thursday the organizing countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where the struggles of influence and lobbying may take the step on the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the queen competition of the Fifa will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its establishment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of delegates (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) measures the economic and political challenges of a World.
Treatments in the back are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to Fifa's assessment report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be too heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations leading to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC released a cover-up on Monday, disseminating a documentary that paints three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to displease Fifa and embarrass the English officials, who have embarked on intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to rewrite the success of the coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who in 2005 obtained the organization of the JO-2012 in London.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to restore the coat of arms of England to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal has no lack of assets with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of the two countries could give rise to their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings of its dossier (states, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced a "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in an allusion barely veiled to the charges of the English press against the members of the EC.
"They're covered in mud, we're trying to compromise them," Mr. Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, strong in the 1994 experience, appeared as logical favorites.
First world economic power, the seat of Fifa's main sponsors, the country seems to have a long lead on Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organised the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the World Cup-2026 to China, ardently desired by the Fifa, which would in fact bring down Asian chances by 2022.
With Qatar, which came out of the big game by proposing futuristic stages, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand to new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of the TV rights paid (due to the time lag) by European countries, the nerve of war for the Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand thought he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One warrant to the Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not do well with the mystery part attached to the presidential function.
Then we must act as if doubt still existed.
In one way or another.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15th, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would take his decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
So let him speak before UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday evening in Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has sown a little febrile.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far away.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year-olds to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential, in the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he had launched them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about the next step."
His remarks yesterday make him no more successful than the day before; they make him no less.
If they raise comments, it's for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race to the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to Segolene Royal that makes Nicolas Sarkozy reveal himself.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS demand a battle order earlier than expected.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this," he immediately and cautiously reacted to the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he believes the defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, clearly resigned.
Euro: the ECB forced to keep its purchases of state securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the modalities for exiting the crisis or at least to announce the cessation of many of the non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed at the end of the year.
A crisis of European sovereign debt requires, the Frankfurt Emission Institute will probably not be able to afford to be as peremptory as it is, but rather to aggravate a more tense situation today in European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she felt that the central bank needed to do more, for example by increasing its programme for the purchase of sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners... "
The day before, in Brussels, at its hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show himself to be more upset about his intentions, merely stating that the programme for the purchase of State securities in the secondary market was "continuous" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main management rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB's purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly €1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, she would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
A total of EUR 67 billion has been purchased by the Eurosystem's central banks since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt as to the expectations of a continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect any significant change in course.
If loan operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on a generous basis and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine that she's significantly altering her program."
"If it were not to take the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," says Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds to encourage an atone market," says Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the packing of returns paid by the most fragile states," said a major bond manager yesterday.
For if interest rates fly, States will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The safeguarding of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government has a round back
After a worrying start of the week for Italy, the situation relaxed a little, yesterday, with the flow of bond rates at 10 years.
A return to precarious calm.
Following a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said that they heard Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation as "undecryptable" and expect a weekend to be "unforeseen", which he then denied.
Tuesday in any case, the gap with the German long rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had flown at 263 points, leading to a certain flood in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, declared himself "strongly concerned" with "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third euro-zone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she's like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In clear terms, its problem is the lack of growth and the atony of tax revenues that goes with, causing the State to run the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under review in the Senate is set at 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the government deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared with 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new budget group that could be set up after the holidays, amounting to €7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," says Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of his economy are in order and his accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short or long-term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested in Italy are lower than those requested in other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, Chief Economist of the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
It would then open up a period that is not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of anti-crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde again hammered him yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that we have demonstrated it again Sunday in the day and in the night, are obviously solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and monetary zone."
Although all relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European state bonds has brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
Standard & Poor's rating agency has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt rating, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs particularly on banking systems," says the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and its dangers, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
This is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin in early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground for it.
The first FSF securities issues are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters that the U.S. would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries that are at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, for their part, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms in addition to austerity measures with closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from those of Greece and Ireland.
Both are keen at all costs to avoid calling for international aid before setting up their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms that are essential to restoring lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of standardising sovereign bond markets.
By way of Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had first advanced the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to hand over its portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would suffice, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with EUR 60 billion to date.
A council that has every chance of being examined carefully in the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsened.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disturb some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Weather France, sustained snow showers affect the north of Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
Snow episodes are sufficiently noticeable to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Weather France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments have been banned from heavy goods vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac routes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking their vehicle only in case of necessity and the circulation of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the circulation of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Civil Aviation Branch (CAG) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights to Roissy Paris airport on Thursday and 10% to Orly due to future snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France has been full, the billions have rained.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion are mentioned for the Greater Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the state announced a capital allocation of €4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the GSP to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 law on amending finance, discussed in the National Assembly's Committee on Finance this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a realignment of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernise it, to increase its product and to affect this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
Mystery.
It's not encrypted in the text.
We're far from 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are added to the EUR 4 billion of the capital endowment that will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses", can be read in the explanatory statement.
At the GPS, we don't find this system shocking.
"From the moment we create revenues (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the 4 billion after, we explain."
"It will be included in the budget and drawn as soon as possible."
The GSP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised 4 billion are still to the missing subscribers, could lead to a somewhat agitated parliamentary debate.
First open meeting on 7 December.
Avenger hackers and spies in diligence
The WikiLeaks case has double value.
On the one hand, it proves to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and prefigures a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only bring back what could be read in any newspaper for months (except for those owned by Berlusconi), and Khadafi's sinisterly caricature profile was long-standing for Cabaret sketch artists.
The rule that secret records should only be composed of news already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookshop dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous books.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (and does not know where to look for news about the inexistant), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe only that they already know, and that reconfirms what they had already learned.
It's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited in spirit) the head of the secret services (or else he could be, as I know, editor at Liberation), who only retain what he recognizes as true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
Then why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state can telephone or fly a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have turned into spy centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows that very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
So the scandal does not put both the victims and the "boars" in crisis.
But let's come to the deep nature of what happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, we could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had proved completely since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the revenger of the citizen - can know all the secrets of the power.
How can a power that no longer has the opportunity to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is true, too, that all knowing about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret of secrecy, because it falls within the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means removing all power from him.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury to a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, the states will no longer be able to put on-line any reserved information - this would mean publishing it on a sticky poster on the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is hopeless to be able to maintain confidential reports over the telephone.
Nothing easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction is about science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligence to uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in a single copy in locked drawers: in the background, the attempt to spy on the Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing in crabs, that is to say, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wired telegraph (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogics) had allowed cinema researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and back and discovering all the secrets of the editing, while now CDs (digital) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is not extraordinary that communications policy and techniques should return to horse-riding cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret of embassies.
Now it is the embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France pushes its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to review compliance with the rapidly unlocked funding promises (such fast start or early start funding) made by developed countries.
And the big French jams are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (or 420 million euros per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU launched the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation is appreciable and valued at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
In 2010, the EU announced EUR 2.2 billion, putting it on the right track to meet its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at it in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must, according to the Copenhagen agreement, be "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference year: international financing is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years to fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France believes that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or to the overall level of official development assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and each chooses its method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ loaned is equivalent to 1€ given.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to emission mitigation that are based on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At the very least, it should be counted as part of its commitments only the cost of the loan to the lender country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing to do with such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of €420 million by making 91.5% of loans (€388.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (€36.1 million) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) fulfil their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1€ to satisfy its commitment, France only puts 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice lap pass!
In short, in its fast-start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only €36.1 million, she is able to suggest that she spends €420 million "new and additional" in line with her promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely dupes...
The chapter on early financing is only a small, short-term issue compared to all climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge UNFCCC machine.
Let's hope that's not the case.
In any case, it is essential to draw lessons from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its method of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): the issue of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans will not be avoided.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
Hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to advance in the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Generations Futures Association (former Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value with regard to the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem addressed", bought between July and September the foods generally consumed in four meals and one snack in one day by a child of about ten years, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as treats, were examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as potential or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as certain carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individual chemical are not exceeded, it is clear in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven to be certain carcinogens as well as about twenty residues that may disturb the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, provided for by the study, has traces of six chemicals, one of which is banned in France.
Same for Kenyan green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even bread chops and gum were made of pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of this "contaminant cocktail" is probably underestimated, according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "front to the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
