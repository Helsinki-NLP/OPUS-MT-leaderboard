European inflation slipped into food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the staggering growth in food prices.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, recording - after 2.6 percent of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Office for Statistics of the Union based in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts only gave as likely a 3 percent - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest on the pretext that the decline, along with rising commodity prices and the reduction of forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least about two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "we have to negotiate" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene later on on.
Inflation of 3.3 per cent, recorded in Germany, hit the twelve-year record; while in Spain it rose from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation took place in the euro area as a result of rising food and energy prices.
End-of-year wheat levies increased by 88 per cent and soya levies have reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching already last month the black gold almost $100 per barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from 2.1 per cent today to 2.5 per cent, in return for 2009 it will drop to 1.9 per cent already.
According to analysts, annual inflation will continue in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, during 2008 the ECB is expected to double down interest rates.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by the beginning of December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while the Gallup never experienced such a low - a 13 percent - level in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the parties' secure voters - due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters - would mean support by more than two thirds (71 percent) compared to support by a fifth for the socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the necessary limit to have some parliamentary seat: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the safe voters there are one percent more sympathizers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the lowest point before - it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believe the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as the next year is concerned, the majority of the population has the deterioration of the situation and only one tenth expect improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the respondents, higher than any previous Gallup survey, felt that the President of the Government was doing rather poorly than well.
13 percent of those consulted trusts or trusts much in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of those consulted.
54 per cent of the population does not trust the Head of Government at all and 27 per cent does not trust the President of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after last year's October riots 35 per cent felt that it would be desirable to hold the Government and the Head of Government in power, this proportion is currently only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) believe that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation replied that they would participate safely and another 20 percent said they are likely to participate.
By comparison, "a general election to be held this Sunday" would safely participate only 55 percent of the population and another 15 percent believed their participation likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters, there was no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
Seventy-four per cent of the population would disapprove of tuition fees, 79 per cent of the medical consultation service and 84 per cent of hospital attendance.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of educational rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The average price increase of 16 per cent was maintained by the hypermarkets of the Budaörs gold trade triangle, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs gold trading triangle the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a much higher growth than the 1000 HUF.
As in December of last year prices in food supermarkets had already been "disappeared", so no drastic increase in percentage compared to the high starting point was experienced.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below the 9,000 HUF, today they cannot do it even for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the Central Bureau of Statistics data, although in the Auchan we also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with a two-litre redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan's basket it was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, regarding last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased by a 15, while Tesco and Auchan by about 18 percent the prices listed in the Napi basket.
Comparing the values of last year's most expensive basket with that of this year's cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year's cheapest and the most expensive of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so that during last Christmas in the prices the increase of VAT was felt.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade, the supermarkets were visibly unable to decide on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of the movement of a product, he may lose a significant profit in the margin that is adjusted to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF than the value recorded in 2006, while at the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, since the highest price of now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic growth in prices was recorded in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of essential consumer items grew more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some basic foods, recorded a price increase of more than 30 per cent in the 12-month period.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to Napi's basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case only a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, and they can impose a drastic price increase even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the gold trade triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers in the three shops visited no longer care about prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking the preserved foods by pallets.
In the morning of Wednesday, the three stores formed large queues in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because revenues remain below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of appliances.
In many hospitals it saves with disinfectants
This year there have been several thousand infections in hospitals caused primarily by the improper application of antibiotics.
The prevailing conditions of hygiene in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds and the overload of staff do not favor the control of infections - says the doctor-chief of department of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many hospitals it saves even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, a MRSA infection has been diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
A person injured by a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient shortly thereafter had to return to the hospital as a result of MRSA infection and since then no major surgery has been possible due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the Nosocomialis Surveillance National System - said Karolina Böröcz, head of department of the National Epidemiology Centre.
This means that the number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has certainly been recorded in hospitals, but no information is available.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-oxacillin resistant.
One third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing any disease.
Infections produced by SA (e.g., inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once it is applied overly or improperly to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics, become highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria and quickly spread under inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or septicaemia, first to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with weakened body, elderly or low-weight individuals.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic Resistant
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff attends to them in rubber gloves and masks and there are antibiotics suitable for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but it is not possible to avoid infection in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA hospital infections in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of formation and contagion with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the diseases that carry MRSA in their body.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come out in public light when MRSA infections are already occurring visible in the patient - said the head doctor of the department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union is strongly committed to the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological conditions.
Antibiotic therapy should be directed, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance from occurring, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological samples are even less frequent in the case of walking patients or in basic care - Karolina Böröcz said.
Saved with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through healthcare staff.
Therefore, they play a very important role in handwashing, the use of rubber gloves and masks, however, there are also considerable shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is infected by drip transmission and direct contact between people, however, in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, the hospital rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least for a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately it can also be experienced - Karolina Böröcz added - that in hospitals with less favourable economic situation it saves with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a higher probability for infection.
In Karolina Böröcz's view, where appropriate prevention measures are being implemented, fewer infections of this type are registered or the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA contagion is a huge expense for the National Sickness Insurance Fund, so it is fought against in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
The program appears to be successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
Denying the control of alcoholemia of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander in District XXII has been made.
The possibility of driving drunk or in a stunned state the then resigned commander of the XXII district police, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a transeunte - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, after the expert report on the case had been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary control of alcoholemia that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before he went behind the wheel.
The then chief of the police station of the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle when he turned to Kossuth Lajos street of the XXII district, hit a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the area designated for pedestrians.
(This last fact, that is, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way when bending.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police leader resigned and applied for his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is under the responsibility of the Budapest Bureau of Investigation.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with the investigating prosecutors.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and the Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit limit agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total value of EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and environment infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget projects for transport and environmental protection, which will be made from the grant of cohesion funds, of which the parties had already signed a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this Hungarian objective, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, the decision will be taken later, when the credit agreement is extended.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the innovation and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the subject of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary finalizes with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro, they will re-examine the issue whether or not it is necessary to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this can take place sooner in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the loans is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charging commission to keep the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of all Europe is directed towards that previously mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who buys in the EU's even cheaper market, which will be rapidly increased?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred goal for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly some Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slopes and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the Albena beaches, the "Golden Coast", the "Costa del Sol", the former Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for properties also in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will awaken the interest of real estate developers and increasingly people will buy properties in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Likewise, the capital Sofia can be attractive, commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive golf havens in Europe, thus being a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Precautionary investors are therefore already shopping, for example around Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their life and way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and traditionally there are many Russian customers on Black Sea beaches and in ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in bad condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They demand good communication and access, and the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor is important to them.
The second category is the purchase of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group consists of real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of profiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital real estate is growing steadily, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they have experienced an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of real estate significantly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, expert-level meetings will be concluded on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue negotiations at ministerial level on the post-2012 international climate regime.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world deliberate on the Bali Road Map, which provides for post-emission reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
There are currently lively discussions on the issue between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that for the time being it does not wish to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to agree that, compared to the 1990 situation, emissions of greenhouse gases will decrease by 25 to 40 per cent by 2020.
Another major theme of the conference is whether or not industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological assistance to countries in need.
In addition, agreement was reached on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member Board of Directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Piac es Profit".
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, regardless of whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed and is willing to commit to reducing even 30% if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries signatories to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol pledged to decrease by 5.2 per cent, within which the 15 EU Member States committed themselves to achieve an 8 per cent reduction.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent over the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will meet - notes the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
Much is at stake in Bali, since within two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed until after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments made in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, whose need was noted in its latest report by the IPCC, the UN's international scientific association dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
As a result, emission reductions would be delayed and could not prevent an increase of more than 2°C in the Earth's average temperature, which, according to scientists, would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British Army units in a video distributor publish footage of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First, the British air force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: Special Units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar's general operating body, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are already 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been uploaded to the Internet in this way and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "headquarters defence" and publishes videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the Community of British Nations (Commonwealth Office) and multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos with recruitment targets, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the British army's presence abroad.
This type of propaganda practically costs nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots - the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - on the other hand, inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the raison d'être of military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned that, in addition to the reciprocatingly edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear in the distributor, for example about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers speak to the maximum of losses, yet present the bloody part of the fights.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in real operations have been uploaded to the Internet from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army has only recently taken advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruiting with free, downloadable video games called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can get directly instead of the soldiers.
Tambola and salted cake at the Christmas feast of the ministries
It does not seem very sentimental the Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth: instead of the Christmas party, he will hold a working meeting for his colleagues who will be able to fire in 2007 with salted cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that celebrates its party with live music, in another it will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with a tomola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so you enjoy the power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the Ministry's workers.
At the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts and for the Christmas of the Missionaries will be invited to the relatives of the soldiers who currently carry out missions abroad. A reception for the press will also be offered.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million to the festive atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Agency for Development (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious holiday with respect to the holidays of the other portfolios
The MET festival will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and of the six hundred workers of the ministry, approximately three hundred and fifty are expected.
At the wallet party there will be a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also perform, and there will be a tomball draw.
The ANF Christmas cost 4 700 000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that the workers of one of the departments of the ANF are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the complete building of the Teatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA as we are unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only housed the ANF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of the day of Lucia on 7 December.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the Minister's greetings and after dinner there was live dance music.
Replying to the question of [origo] they reported: to attend the dance it was not obligatory to dress or dress at night.
Health, work and local government portfolios are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a programme and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth does not wait for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year working meeting.
It is attended by one hundred and eighty guests who - as the press department reported - will have only coffee and salad cake, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai, on the other hand, will simply offer with his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own event hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The holiday party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget the reception with buffet and a toast will be paid.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse, but also by the afternoon schedule of its celebration.
The agricultural portfolio will offer a New Year reception on 20 January, in the Ministry will not be held Christmas.
The reception will be held in the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and, according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the 100 guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple reception standing, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions that are held every year, start with a brief greeting speech from the minister and end with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas parties - this is what the corresponding press departments told [origo].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio, they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the festival to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Commissions will set up a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the Monday strike that will last indefinitely.
On Saturday a protest rally will be held, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the law on public health will be held - the labor stoppage will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulty in transport, as rail transit will be stopped completely and workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike until 1 p.m.
On the afternoon of Friday, the League Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike to be held jointly with the National Federation of Workers' Commissions.
It will also constitute the strike commission of the LIGA and the National Union of Machinists who will coordinate the actions of Monday.
On Saturday a protest rally will be held, while on Monday the participating unions will strike for indefinite time, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the law on public health - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the law on public health, trade unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the National Assembly's Monday agenda, it is also possible that only the public health law will be voted on in the very early hours of the night, or perhaps near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: on the railways it will stop working indefinitely, in the morning it may be a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the interurban bus transport of the companies Volán.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike for indefinite time, others for defined time.
Until Thursday afternoon the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement not even on the minimum services, although, as Christmas holidays approached, there are more and more people traveling on trains.
According to information received so far, from the start of the day until 1 p.m., workers from the Budapest Collective Transport Company, Budapest Airports from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. will hold a four-hour strike by the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the Unions of Educators called for a 2-hour strike and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will act on a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS) that are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation which will come into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, for the case of advanced pensions, that occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Trade Unions do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway sidelines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of the Political Capital the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in August of this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, from several points of view has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region.
The company's "risk warning" writes: in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity, the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the worsening ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of such an event - the representative of the research institute added.
They stated that all this is due to one of the main shortcomings of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the gypsy problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the differences between gypsies between gypsies and Hungarians."
This exacerbates the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country".
We are reminded that since the autumn of 2006 the reorganization of the radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has received increasing publicity and momentum and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been set up in the country to define themselves as "national self-defence associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they are self-defined as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for the defence - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, of the army, that is, of the state" they add.
They stated: all this is done in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and political parties.
To highlight the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but at the same time it is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighborhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring states have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the Hungarian Guard constitution is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar way as for example the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) of extreme right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive riots of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked an animated discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic confrontations that certain gypsy organizations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that Hungarian Gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - can be read in the warning about the risks of the Political Capital.
Political Capital's research director, Attila Juhász, asked the news agency's question: Risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by publishing their risk warning.
The party isn't always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that the next year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Not even in the EU or in North America are parties unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national party, state party and holiday days.
The holidays are mainly related to historical religious and ephemeral feasts.
Let's celebrate the New Year also: both the last day of the old year, as well as the first day of the new year is festive - the latter above all so that they can rest those who spent celebrating the old year.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23, a commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August we celebrated the foundation of the State, on 1 May the feast of work, on 1 and 2 November we reminded our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country are two-day feasts the Easter of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often bridged when before or after the party there is only one working day.
In exchange for the extended weekends, work or school may not be absent from work or school during the previous Saturdays.
He is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal rule is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and civil servants.
It is not mandatory instead for companies and service institutions that, due to their role, work continuously even during public holidays.
This year the work order can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24 the life in the country is practically stopped, since according to the experiences, most people "make bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their vacation during these days.
Next year several of our parties will coincide with midday or weekends, so there will be less changes in working days than this year.
First the agenda will be modified around the work party so that then, for four successive days, the workers can rest.
On Saturday, April 26th will be workday, so that in return on Friday May 2nd will be a holiday.
The other change relates to the feast of October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the anus that comes during the year-end party will be able to rest, since from December 24th it will not work anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little disincentives to bitter the life of your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that pass us without realizing: they are all part of our Folklore" daily at work.
It is necessary to decide whether you adapt to small discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that may irritate others.
Advice.
I'm sorry, I forgot to let you know that you've been wanted by the marketing department," says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best he feels it and tries to fix the matter, maybe he calls the marketing department to tell them that he was forgotten to give you the message (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to scornful explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can bitterly love your colleagues' lives and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow anything that's not yours?
There's nothing more irritating than when you want to get a document, an office utility or your phone and you can't find them.
Remember you put the stapler on the table yesterday, but it disappeared this morning?
Do you find your missing pen at one of your colleagues' table?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be angry with you for taking away their things.
Don't take envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out before time.
Are you gossiping about your colleagues' private lives?
There's no good way to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about the particular life of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your colleague's confidence when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, although others also know his things.
You're leaving sick leave unwarrantedly?
When you phone the office and say you're sick and your head hurts unbearablely, you feel bad or good, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think that others should do your job, your unstoppable tasks, your work at the end.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you won't go to the office or something will happen to you, so you should stay home, contact them, so that your colleagues or your boss don't have to confront you the next day.
Tarareos, risitas, telephone calls
Are you in your job, but are you suddenly getting your colleagues' risillas out of him?
Have you involuntarily heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to hear it?
Don't bother your colleagues with your tarareos, chants, loud conversations (less when you do them above his head), paws, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontents out loud.
All of these may be annoying, even if they are not deepening at this time in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or a message!
Don't mention the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable habit for the house, but it is not suitable for the office!
Don't see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be messy, respect your colleagues and yourself wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation so demands!
Lose interest if you want to meet public expectations
The car progresses slowly in the usual morning attack.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm going up the volume.
Change the rhythm of the music and to the earlier tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The channel mr2 plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national music life did not miscreate us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it seems completely different this attack when you're listening to Zagar's new record.
Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are slowly changing the image and even though the rock style garage is fashionable again, breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are news under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he began his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when he was asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographic (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider public knew the ensemble that initially only played in small clubs when the magazinewan2 selected its first album published in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, capable of also selling in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether or not they wear this label tastefully.
The set reacted as it should react: it prepared a new and even better disc.
The newly released album, Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Balázs Zságer.
It is well the reference on the airy, on the flight, but in addition to the airy music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the set The Puzzle.
The album includes a real success of the channel mr2 Petõfi that recently broadcasts from morning to night popular music. This radio station took the high-flying music of Wings of Love to the ears of radios, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
For everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: the one you are interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Zságer Balázs: The definition of selected audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can also be composed just for sale, making it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially in the west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty years frequent the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are, and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good seeing that more and more people attend our concerts.
But we've never composed music for the market.
We don't compose music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the public's expectations, you lose your interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He worked alone and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don't follow his path, even though they sometimes try to compare our music with his.
Rather, we work as a team, trust each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that we compare our work with Yonderboi's music, as many of us started our career in their group and then started another way.
hvg.hu: In the success list of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in relation to this song.
Did you consciously open with this style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great successes and sell our album with these successes.
This song is more than that.
We added it at the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the heavier topics.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of good voice soloists from our own national music scene.
Thus was created that choir of six women - that is, Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Nemeth - who was later baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly like that or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed long ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the album, we thought there was still something missing.
The chord attracted the song.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came almost to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I also needed the Divas.
With my voice I wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and at the album looks like the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they all sing together and no stronger than music, so music not only accompanies their songs.
Also on the stage they are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
On the other hand, consciously, we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also pours on it, about us forgetting for a while our ego, who from where it has come and where it goes, let those wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
He would have wanted to make others also feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you devote more work to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition in reality none, rather at the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to work the groove and then, little by little, everything put itself in place as a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I've already released the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stock exchange runner risks billions for its inferiority complex
An evil disloyal.
This is how he points out to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banking giant of Société Générale, who also owns the Czech Bank of Commerce.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and certainly with good abilities.
He long ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, introduced the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"It has a fragile character" was allowed to hear from its superiors, the same ones who sent it to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel's answers according to what the French media, such as Le Monde, are translucent is that it was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in his answers.
Precisely, in summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity has already seen her come early in the year.
In February some news began to be heard about sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income clients or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those clients would begin to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and gambled correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I already won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify him," Kerviel confesses and adds, "that nothing has been left to himself at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that it was not discovered.
He even tricked the bosses, even when the Eurex Exchange began to be interested in their business.
The risk became benefit
Were you afraid he'd find out?
Rather, no.
"I thought I had won $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, they would be happy."
Where did you get so much willpower to risk it that way?
In my position, I had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after finishing his studies in Lyon.
Their annual salary was between $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant to the Stock Exchange corridor and in 2005 he became a stock exchange corridor with an annual salary of $90,000.
I still knew I'd never win as much as anyone else.
"In my first interview in 2005, I noticed that they were looking at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described to researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a boot mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll leave you.
"This is like a snowball," the police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or rather suspected it.
"As he made money, they closed their eyes."
Only, later, the blow came early this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to erase all prints.
When he got to work on Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have a vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his file," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to achieve 365 billion
The Ministers of the Government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can achieve 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kroner).
This is almost half the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of the seven operational programmes, approximately Kr 125 billion will come out for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be spent on transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and accounts for up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the Fund.
This money increases the budget of the State fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion kroner.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As far as the current use of EU funds is concerned, the Czech Republic is among the least-used newly admitted countries.
Twenty years for Nicaragua's former president, the court ruled
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Court of Appeals issued a 20-year sentence for former President Arnaldo Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for the loss of $100 billion (almost 1.8 billion).
Nevertheless, some time later, he was released from prison for house arrest in his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, will be back in jail.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will depend more on the prison officers if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they bring him back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved that Alemán was constantly transferring money from the government to a company's account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest family members and supporters.
Part of this money ended in the fund that Alemán created to finance his campaign in the 2001 elections.
That's how we were approved by the budget.
That's right.
The State budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD that could not be allowed not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, quietly adopted the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget departure, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore devote special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three flaws that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenses of the presidents who are not only pensions but also the social benefits that were approved last year before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit in public funding, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not found in the deficit in the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors to be able to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from the taxes, taxes and credits of the banks, often issued meaningless obligations with which they disproportionately owed their municipalities.
In recent years, they have managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy stocks and other development networks that they received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this remedy.
If we stick only to the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, a few years ago, goes through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, from what ČSSD is boasting.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put order to the state's finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to be indebted.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have saved far more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to nations that within global measures we are less threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, in recent years have unnecessarily been flooded with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist expenditures approved this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform do not change then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, rule those who rule will only be a simple bureaucracy.
By exaggerating a little, we can say that politicians who rule will become civil servants, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure on the normal expenses of the mandate holders.
The planned deficit of over 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government hadn't wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We do not want the politicians who rule to become only civil servants so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of the government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to obtain from taxes and fees, tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
More than a hundred billion dollars will be received in the Monetary Marking by tender.
In these tenders the banks lower the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send to bid forty billion dollars, and then another twenty-four billion dollars will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states agree on this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend," wrote in his report for customers, Bernard Baumohl of the consulting company Economic Outlook Group.
"This coordinated action by central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid credits, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what is still waiting for them when they decided to take this step," said ABN Amro's main economist, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
The central banks fear that they will have the same problems with access to loans and will therefore have to pay more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they could not reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates," said Reuters, Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks is helping to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change affects developing countries in particular.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism has now emerged with the closure of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his Blue book, not the green planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations, but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
"There the debates are barely structured, they are artificial fires of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his translated book to German because, as he said, "many times I only find the caricature of my ideas."
Interested parties can now be informed about their varied views.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but has, according to his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor do they represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence climate development are useless, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
To the questions of the present, he repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable environmental advocates but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600 thousand people didn't manage to change their driver's license.
Six hundred thousand drivers were given the date and therefore failed to change their old driver card whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials will give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers are on the roads without the valid card.
According to traffic, the card has not changed mainly those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While in the villages there is a rapid decline in the change of meat, the offices of the metropolis are full of requests and interest in the new meat has increased.
The City Council calculates around 2,000 daily customers.
The tails are expected for half an hour.
In Prague, the new card has not yet been taken out around 140,000 drivers.
The issue of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case, the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must change their car and do not reach the end of the year, but will go out on the roads without the valid car will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the violation with an admonition.
In the event of an administrative infringement, the fine shall amount to 2,500 kronor.
According to the above information, the person who does not go anywhere could receive a fine.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry called on the offices to modestly impose fines of a thousand crowns, at the most.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver's license is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should deliver the driver's license.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to municipal offices.
At the end of the year, meat issued during the years 1964 and 1993 shall cease to be valid.
However, drivers should gradually change the other types of driver's licenses.
Persons with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are some 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to Berdych's accomplice detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Kořařík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych are going to spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague High Court decided as a final expiration the reduction of sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives in the department were going to be plagued by organized crime, initially between 14 and 12 years old.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case charged but he is awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance in the first place.
Despite this, a total of 16 years have already been sentenced in other trials.
He can't receive any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement in the robbery of 19 persons and the High Court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the defendants' allegations were rejected by the investigation because they were fabricated cases.
According to the Senate of the Central Bohemia, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered the thefts, and helped members of the criminal group avoid punishment.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Kořařík.
The charge relates to criminal acts committed by the group between 1999 and 2001.
With regard to theft, their victims suffered serious health impacts, but they are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without weapons permits.
In the home registry, the police found some guns, ammo with steel core, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of crowns.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this trial, the court has already convicted Berdych and other defendants.
Other men related to Berdych's case are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pýt and Maroš Šulej, who have for now avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
An account to change a few children: 12 million
For changing some children in the maternity home the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of Třebič 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostal, does not agree in principle with Veleba's proposal.
"This demand we do not approve, it is too high," Dostal said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the expert's report that the counterparty commissioned to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescission value.
We remain in the opinion that there will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dostal said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 kroner for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jabloń's family wanted, for each month they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was prepared in the hospital of the faculty of Motol in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better endured by men even though they fought with recriminations for the change of girls.
Women take him worse with the trauma they are currently living and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at the Třebič maternity home last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový in Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloń.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered at the end of October to each family 100,000 crowns as compensation for the error committed in the hospital of Třebič that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must draw from the reserve fund and extraordinarily they can ask the administrator for help.
The court thus far recognized them with proportionally low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Valachia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the Kingdom brand of Valachia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava he was the first to use the Kingdom brand of Valachia but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear at the oral hearing today.
According to his lawyer, the case probably isn't over and his client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity," he said after the trial, Polívka's lawyer.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Valachia, the image of the actor and comic comes to everyone.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been after us about ten years of work.
Searching for money and inventing activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
"After years I realized that the project is successful and that I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Kingdom of Valachia brand was first used by Polívka in his television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not a matter of directing him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš was asked to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Valachia.
From this comic origin it was a business and a lucrative business from which Harabiš later created the company Kingdom of Valachia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature on passports and even offered his owners discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also determined today that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on the stage for her own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valachia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project, Harabiš and his team were fully involved in it.
The collaboration, among today's decomposed parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment on, conflicts began between Polívka and Harabiš whose culmination came with the overthrow of the "king Boleslav I, the chosen one forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš's mediation, was born in singer Jarmila Šulaková, as mother queen.
In 2002, Polívka filed an indictment against Harabiš and his society, which until today has been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring into the dispute, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
He did not want to reveal any more data or dates.
"We're in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's path to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can present himself," added Harabiš.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: prejudices overcome
To tell you the truth, I've never liked Peugeot 206 too much.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is its successor, Peugeot 207, on the market, and this one, is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the headspace in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the bodywork of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer in front of the two meters of length.
Flying around the world
I go through the inside quickly so I don't repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate the design invention even though the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space, and here you can feel how the body measurements have grown.
In the Combi there is no shortage of space in the head.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is his trunk.
I must value it as very accessible (thanks to the abatible back gate) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that represent an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic mode it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the same type of vehicle best sold in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the new generation of Mladá Boleslav's model, we find that Peugeot is left behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when placing the child's car, its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I must quote the flat that remains quite flat after lowering the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four gears
Our car test was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a 1.6 l. capacity and a 88 kW force.
And to tell you the truth, that's how it should look like a 1600 that despised the family member five doors.
It is silent, consumes little and above all, has impulse.
If I compare it to the time of the then škoda that seemed as if the escape tube was plugged by a rag, I can say that with it I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 per 329,900 kroner, can still be.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we'd still have airbags on the headboards, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper, automated rear windows...
I mean, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but count on the team's complements at Fabia and you'll get a pretty similar number.
Now it's only left to decide by which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries attend, and locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans so far brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between emigrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is very well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak migrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and student jokes have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating sticks to a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense she said that the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
The police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak emigrant.
The girls harassed him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we were going home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and began spitting on us.
When I told him to leave him, he made us the fan of throwing apples and pears, and then he dropped his pants and showed us his ass," he described another nasty incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with emigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools is beginning to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled, provided you choose correctly.
Sand and golden beaches, large waves or a calm sea like a pond.
palm trees and all enclosed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on an island finds much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
In the Spanish era, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called her, the most beautiful place human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and port of loading of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He had it built by one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything about crime in the United States (and therefore forbidden) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high buildings emerged, along wide avenues ran the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bodeguita they left their signatures the stars of the world of spectacle and politicians all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita Abánense you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the dear National Hotel you mix the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cult cars of the 1950s, until today, still operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat who arrived a long time ago have rusted between these wet and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter is deteriorating noticeably, there are not so many wonderful colonial monuments in the vicinity as there.
Other places metamorphose in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much needed money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguin province and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and that is highly appreciated by railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the huge plantations to the narrow-track sugar factories in steam or electric machines.
His garages for decades were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose brotherly models that exist in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the above mentioned estate of Hemingway there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not stop visiting it.
The valley of Viñales is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation growing in limestone lands.
Mogots, limestone piles and rocks of high steeped in the falls of the valley, and in their caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where tobacco of the highest quality is probably cultivated in Cuba.
Visiting some of the cigar factories can be found with their final product.
Perhaps someone would find it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was rolled over there.
Trinidad
Old-age town that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought it fame and wealth.
The wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who arrived later, in four centuries has hardly changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Scambray mountain range, is such a remote place that in the 1950s of the last century there was no road to join it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore, neither was anything destroyed, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than one afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as the Playa de Ancón or the valley of sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Bark
Small town in the western end of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that view is already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that hardly knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been registered as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (it is actually a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was and that now there is a hotel with its same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of the Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of the Copper, the Santeria, an African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, could be filled with many pages.
However, as you say, you'd better see him sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient necessary equipment are influencing the mission's progress in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Defense Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working as thought, the representatives of the countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week, through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to become more active, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the Afghan government's authority and the sharing of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population to start economic and security development alone," BBC Minister of Defense Des Browne told the station.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to American army data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased compared to the last year by 27 per cent, and in Helmand province up to 60 per cent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which one quarter are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit as regards the organization and equipment of the units.
They are exactly asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, also spoke today.
"I am not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of soldiers and teams that we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told the Reuters agency in the closing of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries attending in recent months is the controversy over whether all the allies make the most of it in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for its liabilities.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the demands of struggle there are not as high as in ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun, this week called the German soldiers vague.
"Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troops played a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach billion in 2009
For each Czech the State owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt amounted to 842.7 billion kroner in September.
This year, the government planned to lend $159.2 billion.
However, at the beginning of December the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the improvement of the economy of the state budget.
The Czech Republic's state debt increased to CKr 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In nine months this year it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
However, since June, it has decreased Kr 13.4 billion.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the debt of the state of early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 kronor.
Over the past year, the State was indebted to more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year we could cross the border of the billion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 90 billion and the billion crowns," said iHNed.cz server, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora, sees it: "We could spend the billion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the situation on the political scene was seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But such a change I don't see it," he added.
Doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
The state debt is paid by means of treasury bonds, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the state grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The external debt for now has grown from R$ 1.7 billion to R$ 123.3 billion.
The so-called debt of the negotiable state at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z kroner since June was reduced by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average maturity of state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total annual debt from the first to the third quarter creates a 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from obligations where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it is going to be negotiated until there is a pension reform" said Pikora.
Better than expected
From the state's payment strategy and debt management for 2007 it is extracted that the government planned this year to lend $159.2 billion.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry decreased the plan by 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit in the state budget, which this year will be 76 million kroner instead of the planned 91,300 million kroner.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech consolidation agency with some 13.3 billion kroons, the reserve of 10 billion kroons for the payment of pensions, 43 billion kroons to finance state bonds and 1.8 billion kroons in payments of European investment bank loans.
I was comparing today in front of a courthouse in Khartoum for giving a name to a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and expulsion, his lawyer said.
The British was accused of letting students aged 6 to 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when all representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was liable to a beating.
This 54-year-old British school teacher under the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested on Sunday in her home and charged with an attack on Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of students before the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story dates back in fact to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
" Eight names come out of the children's mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, " says the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after one vote in class, 20 children in each 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself - carried no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the prophet's representation considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues at Gillian Gibbons, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I am only sorry that he asked the children to vote for a name, " according to him it is only a "innocent mistake. "
Opinion divided by many schoolteachers who describe it as "very attentive to their students " and " never speak of religion in class " .
Let us remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have finished a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status, " said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was at stake, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not foresee violence for now but enter a very difficult period, " he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist. "
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province inhabited by 90% Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final meeting of negotiations since the troika was in charge of a new mediation by the UN last August.
The US and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond that date.
" Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution, " said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of administration of the Kosovo UN, the Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve its behalf.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," said Kosovo's autonomous authority president Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these "last opportunity negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his sorrows.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to a past that has led to killings and deportations."
" Effect Dominoes "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade particularly fears a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
" For Serbia, " he said, "this does not mean that a commitment is impossible. "
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belonged exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a veto right.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, " Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the statute " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanians would be " in consultation " with the Westerners.
Bush opens an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he convened on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common declaration.
He specified that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to enter into immediate negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must put an end to its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides ' obligations to the peace itinerary they accepted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt " to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This denomination covers the three main perilous problems of the disputed point between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American President, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "globalized and deepened" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing " Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things. "
On his way back to the rostrum, Olmert committed himself to what the upcoming negotiations are "direct and continuous" and to "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush set at the end of 2008 the end of the implementation of its co-existing Palestinian and Israeli " vision of two States " .
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made an effort in this regard on the part of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a turning point in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects, " says Prince Saoud in his Arab periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the D.A., the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just as each time in this type of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the French National Police Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17th, Luisa-Miguel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
" I was not in surgery, but on patrol, and I was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating beacon, " explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, i.e. not authorized to circulate on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was circulating " to all gas " .
" He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the cede the step to the right, " the police said.
The control of alcoholemia on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (the ungrounded front, cracked windshields, broken bumps) bears witness to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the procurator of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " acts of involuntary homicide and denial of assistance " to the IGPN, co-hosted with the departmental direction of public security in Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor specified that the investigation of the IGPN at this stadium ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the version of the police officers, namely that this mini-ticket arrived relatively quickly to his left " .
Yesterday, a type of slot, undoubtedly caused by the rubbing of the socks on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been framed the time for the police car to stop.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims have been autopsyed yesterday.
What happened just after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the site very quickly, not thus helping both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also remove " any serious shortcomings " with regard to this point.
" It is the most difficult aspect of research, which needs more research, on which one must be very careful, " said a police source.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that exactly gives to the scene.
" We go down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to resuscitate them, " says this witness.
There was nothing to do. "
Then he saw "a completely deranged cop, who was limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the youths, the fourth was speaking on the phone. "
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently with the certainty that the people were present of the unexpected situation of the young, the police have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
Always according to this witness, the relief came "about twenty minutes after the police march. "
They also practiced heart massages in vain.
" I will not let it be assumed that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been helped.
The firemen arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them, " stressed the prosecutor.
Voltage rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency have been injured by the tear grenades used by law enforcement officials, according to witnesses.
The latter responded with stone shots, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court lawyers demanded a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement picked up on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president "invited the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the state of emergency and the waste to which they swore oath in front of Musharraf".
" Musharraf's Promise No longer Fulfills "
The Supreme Court of Pakistan refers directly to the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to rule in the next few days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been eliminated and replaced.
" Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional, and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court, " the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf ' s promise to leave the army head and become a civilian president " no longer values " after the establishment of the state of emergency, declared Monday to the Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister for Information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government dismissed insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy chief of the armies.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unpredicted
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one pregnancy of every three (36%) is not foreseen, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterilet still show a failure rate of 5 % to 6 %, estimates Ined.
However, the liberalization of contraception allowed for a better "domain of fertility, " according to the Institute which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated a little more or less a month for a couple in five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair of the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel indispensable for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated the records due to its duration, its removal from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "capuched" by the astronauts to make the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday, then, that the astronauts had released the Harmony module from the Discovery launcher, a thick cylindrical piece tasked with hosting soon the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing platform for the modules-laboratories.
But we have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17,5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the reorganization of the solar panels of the module that have a size of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold as accordions, has been damaged in just over a meter by a wire that got stuck.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had to perform an exit control of the Discovery launcher, and then go repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to caracolear at the end of the 30 meters length of the teledirected arm of the shuttle added to the station to make the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalker (space walker) in Nasa.
High, resistant, very skilled, has the torso very developed and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been in charge of "operation" the solar panel "hidden".
After precisely inspecting the damage, he cut the fallable cable and installed "tables" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second spacewalker who had remained close to the air lock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped with insulator to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "capuceated" by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a noon break before today, seven astronauts returned from the Discovery launcher for the planned return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned in Stock Exchange
EADS is currently in sharp decline at the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautical and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros to the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to review its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditions the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost to alleviate the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to " between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion euros for Airbus", announced the mother house of the European constructor EADS.
Because of these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the operating result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adds without any more precise encryption.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS' operating result fell by 86 % in 2006, mainly due to delays in the implementation of another programme, the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group provided for a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians are going to choose massively for President Putin's party, Russia united.
Confirming your aspiration to stability, including authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends to the voters today a television message about the public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It does so as leader of the list for the united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is proving overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new burden against the West accused of interference - his favourite theme during the campaign.
" We know the price of true democracy and want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incident, " he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
It denounces a campaign muffled by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that "there has never been such a dirty election until the time of Eltsin. "
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, the former world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days' imprisonment for illegal demonstration, is banned from visits according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to be announced.
Elected in 2000 and elected again in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in legislative elections as well as presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
" The Russians kept the mentality of the sovieticus homo, they do not feel they own their destiny, " says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historian Nikolaï Kopossov, of the state university of St. Petersburg, goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Putin restored the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic relief, " says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " voluntarily renounce personal responsibility " of those who had briefly proved themselves after the outbreak of the USSR.
" Why reflect? "
The phenomenon touches all social strata, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians, they will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion by Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: " Why reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them? "
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in open access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of shelves at Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not available here only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of an ex-victim or his right-holders.
The eleven States in charge of its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to searchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening is effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians ' access to Bad Arolsen will allow searches " particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers " , explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, such as Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the peasants deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, eventually, to provide proof of their internment, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
" There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents, " said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade is now around EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
The European Union Foreign Ministers had given their approval last April to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
" A free trade pact will do much to both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans, " explained Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants change annually by "47 billion euros of goods " and "10 billion euros of services ", this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential". The European Union and India are on Friday for its eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England takes note of concerns offering £10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of £10 billion to the base rate of 5.75 % in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
" In order to alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty as to how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, " states in a statement.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12:15 GMT, at the basic index and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the bank England BoE puts liquids on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its communiqué that " it is prepared to take further steps to maintain the rates " of day-to-day interbank loans in line with its base rate.
The interbank rate per day was on Wednesday of 5,829 %.
The index after three months was set at 6.6%, highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of the summer, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England were combined with an important penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the change in the pound relative to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny examination of the PS party's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group refused to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power on Thursday, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
In a socialist "niche" (meeting for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national PS office, including the 50% increase in the employment surplus, the reinstatement of the floating TIPP (inner fee for petroleum products), a transport check or rent restrictions.
Since UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was adjourned at the end of the general discussion which led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between the majority and opposition at a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS MP leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
" For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more or less, the current movement of festivals in America, " said Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival would take place from 8 to 10 August in a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
At another time known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republican Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80 000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and later, in 2006, the Republican Festival created the Latitude Henham Park Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizing of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as a "more inspiring event" to which he has never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
" We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with perseverance with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, " says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we stagnated in low-grade policies because of the current administration, chases Charlie Jones.
" Fortunately, we were able to argue with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that will lately take place in Philadelphia. "
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after having demarcated in the landscape of the festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
" Melvin Benn's European model is a rural festival, while ours is more in urban green areas, " says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give at the same time an impression of a campestre festival in the European and urban ways in the American way. "
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
" The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event, " says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life. "
Charlie Jones says that the hotel offer for this festival is "very big", for example that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been launched to the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going to press.
" Vineland will taste like rock, but music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators, " says Charlie Jones.
His C3 teammates, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal Faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood movie dishes to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the role of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions. "
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
" Be careful, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best, " he says.
The race to the festivals
For the time being, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The Oskar race is on.
All festivals on the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them value and make sure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the billboard to Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a rally from the end of the year to the stock market? The experts, divided by the crisis 'subprime'.
Less than five weeks before the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional rally to arrive at the end of the year.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in stock exchange is often a positive one.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, even more so because, in the current context, uncertainties lurk on markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange taking off the cart in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the flight effect towards quality values in both long and short stretches".
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have a rather lateral behavior, not free of volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decline of the Fed types is not known, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be rally.
"There is not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% from the peaks marked on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermony, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert says that things will be something different this year as he believes that the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the constitutional bridge.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Bank, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a rebound in the index that could be driven depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for bringing the Ibex to new peaks.
Solana, from Intermony, states that "this year it is about the great values".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some builders "because when the date arrives, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Bank assures that the climbs will come from the hand of the bank and the industrial sector.
Manufacturers will also be able to benefit from this rally if they do.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow their same path," explains the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be the main factor in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a low month.
The real rally of the end of the year was lived in 2003, an exercise in which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a rebound of 6.68%.
You will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of winnings (for the time being the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and if you can count on your year-end rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours Monday to Saturday
People have decided to renew much of their offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent a great change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group to decide to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 in the afternoon, and open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 in the afternoon.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, he is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of People's experience will be decisive if other entities are to sign up or not to this initiative that follows the schedule of trades.
This is precisely the objective that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture private customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, autonomous and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling of existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernize its branches in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the clients of the different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The commercial bank manager, Angel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring does not involve a major investment, even if a larger number of staff are hired, since there are more than six employees per location to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
People have already tested their initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax premises they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of their offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers', Rivero points out.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobiles, with outside staff to the bank.
Telecinco first doubles the stock in Stock Exchange of its rival Antena 3
We got it.
With that sentence yesterday he expressed his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the closure of the market, when he found that the chain that led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect filled his joy: 'it is what hurts me, it is not because we have grown more but because we have come down less', he said.
Still, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
This gain places its loss in what we have been doing for the year at 15.66%.
The stock of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday yielded 1.52% and accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million Prisa (five-day publisher) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience'.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel this year to exceed the 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
If this announced data became real, the television channel would record an increase of 3.6 per cent in its advertising billing over the 965.4 million of the 2006 financial year.
For its part, the net billing of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net television revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarria distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we are able to make our shareholders happy, whom we have already given value to with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its benefit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
It is explained that the projected income growth has been cut from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antena 3's profit forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecuritys: recommends buying both values based above all on their high profitability per dividend and sustainable potential in the long term.
2.
Box Madrid: sees Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antena 3 (maintain) for the 'multiple attractions' and increase of the business.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends underweight in both cases by having 'like threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
In parallel to its parliamentary process, which ended today with the Congress' vote on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has put before public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation in order to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activities of the entities for the efficient functioning of the markets.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves modernising financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new legislation will provide financial advisory services to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial service firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (FIAs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are complemented by multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all the transactions they carry out, in order to facilitate oversight by the CNMV.
In its passage by the Congressional Economics Commission, several amendments were incorporated, including the fact that securitized debts are considered a "complex" financial instrument given their high peril to the investor, which has been demonstrated by the debt of US high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics and Business can perform 30 years after the adoption in 1977 of the Royal Decree delimiting the professional functions reserved to economists.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of others, will not require authorization from CNMV and will be able to provide its product marketing and customer recruitment services to different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised CPI increases five tenths in November, to 4.1 per cent
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it in the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices in Spain evolved during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be released on December 14.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice-president and Minister of Economics, Pedro Solbes, has said that the rise in 4.1% of the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he has hoped that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the halls of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with respect to monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," said the Minister of Economics regarding the data that was in progress today.
Virgin plans to raise with Northern Rock €42 billion in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (16.8 billion) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time, he piled up record deposits of more than £25 billion, a figure that has gradually fallen in two and a half months due to his clients' distrust and despite the 100 per cent guarantee of that money offered by the Government and which will continue until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the entity with its Virgin Money financial trade mark, needs to capture around a quarter of the income in British banks that are deposited in the next three years to get those remaining 18 billion pounds to reach the target of 30 billion.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for his impressive advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend £50 million (about €70 million) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of Virgin's consortium, in which three other companies participate, as their favorite to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Arrested mayor of Totana for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of Totana (the People's Party) in the first hour of the morning for his alleged connection with the plot of urban corruption that broke out this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the Consistory and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then governor of the municipality, last May, and that according to research sources consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
Agents continue to register municipal units and the city councillor and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the plot of urban corruption that emerged earlier this week, has been charged.
As the SER Chain reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore out of the way, was arrested leaving Morales's home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the subject of the investigation, according to the sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to lead PSOE's candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the
Former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the president of the government and secretary general of the socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of Congress in case the socialists win the general elections.
This was announced by the PSOE Secretary of Organization, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "yes it seems" that the political mannego will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who made public on 15 November his decision not to run for the next general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to fight climate change at university level.
The former Minister has acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left her two years ago.
In addition, he has pointed out that, as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not the house of insult or the cry" and make him "look more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk quietly and calmly is Congress, the president of the government on one occasion interrupted him in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín, and "his good doing" and has not wanted to see him occupy his post in order not to fall into what, as he has pointed out, his adversaries could see as "prepotence".
Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to insecurity and persecution of both the skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron consistency.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in violation of Kyoto.
Who are responsible for the non-compliance, in which sectors it has occurred and why their Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires you to explain with the utmost clarity to the Spanish what measures you will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits must be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
I mean, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there hasn't been any such explanation.
Precisely because it's about sacrifice and payment.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Cost, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the cent of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he has hurried to deny it.
I mean, it's about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking sentences, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
Whenever it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not pretend that we move on a bicycle or refresh ourselves with the fan.
Arrested mayor and local police chief of Totana for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the city council and a hotel businessman for possible urban crimes, have today reported sources of the investigation.
The building was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose units he is currently with numerous agents, who have also attended the Council of Urbanism and the municipal company of management of the Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rural land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 houses, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs Judgement No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have come to justice today.
According to the sources, Totana's former governor and now the autonomous MP of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, the owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the former registrar's current girlfriend, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman vigués Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), like Pablo José M.G., director of Immonuar Soil, an agency integrated into the aforementioned Group, and through which bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven records, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was then arrested in Totana, specifically the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murtian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the vigus car parks of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and of the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the sector of direct marketing; Preconiza, centered on the promotion, sale and installation of elements of the construction.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (by the way, at the top of the PISA report on the world's educational level), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the symbol of Philosophy has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The person responsible for the deaths, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers take a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes."

A colleague provides information on the introduction of Internet download offences into the Criminal Code:
A. The release of a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to one year.
Instead, if you steal disks worth less than 400 euros in the store, it is simply considered to be missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros in the store, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the charge of unloading (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of the discharge (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to be involved in a fight than to be involved in the exchange of compacts.
Participation in a tumultuous riña has a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than a DVD film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected films without author authorization is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is right, someone is going hand in hand, a very long hand.

My head doctor leaves me one of his articles on rare research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
That is, that the feelings that generate the monthly pay of the workers depends on what the comrades gain.
The study has been carried out using magnetic tomographic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that if they both received the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one received double, activation was higher.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with a bitter sweet taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
His names are on that list of which takes his title the documentary of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'The list of Carla' (2006, not debuted in Spain) who, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to prosecute the criminals fleeing and to pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What kind of insurance do I need?
The car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, involves a significant expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the car, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use of, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
And it's just that choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we must be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is embodied in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being held responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that at the greater probability of suffering an accident, higher fee to pay.
That is why both the over 25 and the women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower sinister index due to their prudence.
Also, by handing out the accounts, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of having some kind of perch.
Increasing the frequency increases the odds.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver has to study the situation well in order to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will explain here the most significant variables when choosing one or other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various disadvantages when hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as the reduced driving experience and the seniority of the card.
Although the ideal thing to be well insured is insurance at all risk, there are other cheaper options.
Precautionary drivers can opt for a whole risk with franchise, so they get insurance coverage at all risk but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would mean that the customer pays a part of the amount of the disaster.
"The part of the amount of the damage that the customer brings will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount", specifies Luis Noguera, maximum responsible in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is an extended third party insurance, so that the customer is guaranteed protection against damage caused to third parties, although not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will have an impact on the bonus, thus reducing the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the basic fee that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that basic fee.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its benefit.
If the company has had a good year it can afford to increase the bonuses," Noguera explains.
After the 25-year-old strip, drivers have it easier to hire insurance, as the rate of sinisterity is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is most advisable to hire a whole risk with franchise.
"Youth usually cannot make use of the experience previously gained when using an accident, and even when driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the customer is married but still has no children it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at all risk, provided that his economic situation allows him, of course he is.
For its part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest rate of sinisterity, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at all risk with franchise (which may be 300 euros), or, where a high level of bonus is available, one to thirds extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury of assuming a larger amount of franchise," Luis Noguera says.
For retirees it is advisable to have insurance at all risk with franchise (this being 150 euros), or one to extended thirds when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expenditure, which is why it is essential to study properly the insurance that suits us best according to our personal situation.
The Celtic seeks in Milan a point that is worth the eighth
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the "Champions" leotard, as the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to judge their classification.
The Italians add ten points and already certified their pass on the fifth day with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another one to ensure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that he receives the Benfica, who has four, does not go ahead.
These two games of Group D will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to compete for the World Clubs in Japan, where it debuts on the 13th in semifinals in search of a place for the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would stay first and ensure a better cross in eighths.
Gordon Strachan's set could even serve a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar doesn't win, but he won't be able to trust himself because on equal nine points the pass is for Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the milanists will try to bitter the Scots at night, who trust to get into eighths for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round the last campaign with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) after 0-0 of the go.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar to which only the triumph is worth, in case he loses the Celtic, both to get into eighths and to continue in the UEFA.
And it is that the Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the maximum European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert on the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, with some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they were dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "brillant".
Around 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to witness the concert that included a video telling the story of the group that made it furious in the late 1990s.
The rendezvous and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that captures its main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went on stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the audience that surrounded GM Place, despite the fact that Victoria's nerves had been banned days earlier.
In the run-up to the start of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British star "has not seen our wardrobe at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think about the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling of the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that over time, "things have been arranged and we love each other so much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last played together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of babysitters was waiting for them.
Of the five, there are seven children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will act on 23 December.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of Russia's export of fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rock between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, a monopolistic gas owner, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it will charge Ukraine more, as Ukraine has committed itself to paying an extra 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine pays 40% more for Gazprom's imports.
"It's important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," Ukrainian Minister of Economics Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"Changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which rapidly increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "must test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to control the criminal record records of employees outside Europe, said a vigilante.
Auditor General Robert Black's recommendation came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of how many foreign staff it has.
However, his report pointed to other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The Auditor General checked the number of foreign staff recruited outside the European economic area as a result of attacks at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep was struck at the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who acted in Old Bailey for video conference in October, accused of alleged car bomb attacks in the UK.
NHS hopes to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The Auditor General's report recommends, inter alia, that boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which assists employers with criminal controls in many countries outside of Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says the report.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but points out that "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of foreign NHS personnel."
The president of BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work at NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he explained.
Scottish health authorities declare that there are currently 1,161 foreign people, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor General warned that the number may be higher, in part because the boards have problems identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lotian were being carried out extensively.
This includes passport checks, work permits and qualifications checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide for foreigners in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I had a great interest in this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - what they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the biographical film about Joy Division's late vocalist, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for the best film.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for Curtis' role, for director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress by the thriller "Notes of a scandal."
And Bond's star, Daniel Craig won the variety prize for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were given at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - that features the soundtrack of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only 3,000 pounds sterling.
But the Dutch photographer Corbijn also won, already known by the iconic label of the album Joshua Tree of U2, awarded with two awards- to best director and best debutante director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning ceremony - like Julien Temple's film about The Clash singer Joe Strummer, won the award for the best documentary.
The award to the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a head of the Russian Mafia of London, in the film of David Cronenberg Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The 50th, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of the Crystal Calavera".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named in honor of Harris, Camelot star and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, he's really an honor."
Independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The sympathizers and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 Terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell activists planning an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following Iraq's invasion.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil installation in the eastern province, declared the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world's largest oil plant, after a failed attack by Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Minister of the Interior, said that 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight shells into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in arresting the Saudis who travel to Iraq to join Al-Qaeda as militants to fight the allied forces and to support the Muslim Shiita government, which is considered heretic by the most extreme Saudi Sunians.
Al-Qaeda activists target many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been designated by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the country's pro-Western government - had as their objectives residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, for five months of work," the spokesman for the interior minister said to state television.
The arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Suní Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 other persons accused of providing financial support and support to the militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus may once have been a suitable place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship in orbit showed the planet more like a Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those that made the Earth a living planet, now believe scientists.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and the slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide an overview of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission states: "It is becoming clear why the climate in Venus is so different from that of Earth, when two planets are so similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago."
Police take "enriched uranium"
One kilo of radioactive material, which they declare is enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds sterling).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says it's not worthy for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which common and current voters record questions on video and send them to broadcast to candidates.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey who asked the Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican YouTube party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party in front of next year's election.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsored the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates for candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest one-item discussion, focused on immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to go up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: the broadcasters noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The harshest word exchanges of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his house.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, agreed to the issue.
No one has the floor to be nominated as a candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned about immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and generally, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance to illegal immigrants.
This topic, together with the fear of China's toxic toys and other external concerns, helps Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee -now, against all expectations, first in Iowa's latest survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to answer if Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr Huckabee is increasing in Iowa, coincidentally with the funding-raising campaigns of Liberal Ron Paul, and his heated statements of Wednesday's debate.
They both came out from the bottom, because the two sides of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Workers' pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They don't seem to have sold any influence, nor are they exorbitant accounts of hotels in Paris, nor do they suck off extra-marital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour government party of more than £650,000 ($1.3 million), for nearly four years using false names, and that the party did not denounce it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister failed to call an election, foolishly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat leads with growing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's bailout, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and trial poverty in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals began a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against the cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary General (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means Mr. Brown is heading irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they are unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their unbelief when a new batch takes control.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister cannot improve things, that he does not have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is defensive and does not focus.
On the one hand, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders it cannot be defended by arguing that it is new.
Although I'd like to deny Tony Blair, he was his superior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as chancellor of the era.
And even when it is not directly involved in Blairish's setbacks - or "effective for partners", the investigation of the financing of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor been directly conned.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not made by him.
The anti-anonymity laws for large political taxpayers are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that it was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fund-raising chief who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these performances, although the bulk of the payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the work.
It has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but it is diluted in decision-making by a family matter, a commission of inquiry on the matter - led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent leader for the Public Life Standards Commission, since he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for a genuine reform of party financing.
This will require hard cooperative work by the workers with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial situation with the unions - bitter measures for a partyist such as Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and strong competition.
Card sharks
Is the mortgage crisis subprime infecting the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's natural that some dorsal fins swim excited around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the mortgage crisis subprimes other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion can be seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million positions in its US consumer financing business, partly due to the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it is very early for panic.
Morosity and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, in the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in American bankruptcy law (2005) resulted in a sudden fall in bankruptcy claims, which in turn represent a major loss in credit cards; the number of claims (and therefore of lateness) would be growing again, or it may happen that the conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is fairly strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the issue volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are dropping.
But credit card issuers look more at the liquidity flow than active securities, so that falling prices do not necessarily trigger a change in borrowers' lending capacity.
They can even work to advance issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue to amortize the mortgage decrease if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card's debt goes up on the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions of mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of rapid asset retaliating.
"We're not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Chief Finance Officer of Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit contraction push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more severe future.
You gotta keep watching those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility for fraud with Enron's former head of the financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for colliding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. District, each was convicted as guilty of collusion in fraud.
The three former Greenwich Natwest executives, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the slow end of an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were for alerting Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron's fall.
The charge against the bankers - folded the "NatWest Tres" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his previous superior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, who was the creator of a myriad of frauds in Enron, which helped his spiral of bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary in zero, but the three British knew it would value up.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest in $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its subsidiary parts.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the prosecution.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in Enron's collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the nation's seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make its failed businesses look successful.
The collapse led to the loss of thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay, and former chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling were held as defendants last year for their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither below nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"It has capacity up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, Gulfstream's representative.
"But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it's for private family flights or for presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day consumer orgy held at an event center in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract the new Russians to all kinds of products, from crafted yachts in mahogany to diamond-encrusted car grills, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche at his neighbor's stand."
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and boiler compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Supplyed with fuel from the oil boom, Russian capital looks like Dallas when it was at apogee.
"We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
"Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and spenders."
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their part of the cake.
In another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think tank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, London's jeweller.
She attends the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in afternoon costume, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," Yumatova said, who reeled off the design suit he was wearing as a carpet net they'll veto dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the kind of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a store that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum clips, Mövenpick ice creams, commissioned pool tables, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears from Gund.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically in a stand of royal Dutch Delft porcelains, in front of a wall-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling."
In fact, the sellers said that the wealthy Russians of the most trajectory (10 to 15 years old, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from striking logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exposed at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people: cash millionaires, millionaires' emissaries or tourists, fill the halls every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, Managing Director of King Koil Beds, said he sold two $70,000 dollar mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
In the afternoon of Sunday, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three car grills in the form of chain bracelet, for Rolls Royce Phantom, at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with embedded rays of Swarovski colored crystals, so that he would resemble a roulette wheel.
Cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's gonna keep the car in his garage, next to 30 or 40 other cars."
Even if many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it's not cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich for the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red telephone booths (British style) filled with $1 million in counterfeit bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures of their mobiles while resting on piles of money, or packing a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
"Chapuza" surgery could cause a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant "A little healthier" and saw how an ambulance went up by White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car showed up.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the ambulance go up," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, assistant to the director of the Newark police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at the 212 West Scott Avenue house.
The authorities still do not determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but wait for the toxicological test although the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help to resolve the mysterious death that has plagued the upper ranks of Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been assistant police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, and left two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for the County Union Attorney, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives are trying to determine if Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said the house arrived about 3 P.M.
On November 21st, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was declared dead on the spot.
It has been more than a week and the authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh couldn't say if Mrs. Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a marquee rosal is located at the front of the house, and a dammata bark at the back.
A blue drum labeled "vanillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - was at the door of the garage, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in helping to get to know the new island city and its harsh political culture.
"She would say, "you have to watch with this one or that one," she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
It's embarrassing."
The federal reserve is expected to cut the fees to raise the Stock Exchange
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm credit conditions with cuts to interest rates, which increased with the reassuring comments of the vice president of the US central bank.
The bags were loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second-largest of Ben Bernanke, president of the reserve, declared that policy makers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continuing tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets in the midst of growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence was "in part reversed by market improvement at the end of September and during October."
If the upward trend persisted, additional adjustments to the financial conditions for real estate and business would increase, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into US markets and to make further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped to calm Wall Street in the midst of bad news for the US economy, such as home sales that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, which is equivalent to 4% of its total labour force, in an overall cost reduction to offset losses of its investments in US sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, to 13.289.40, while the broad index S&P 500 rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to the close of 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of Britain's leading companies.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6%, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Prior to this, the re-emergence of credit stress on markets was highlighted after a strong demand in a three-month European Central Bank auction of funds, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the federal reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the securities markets in London, strained the credit and rates of the three-month "Libor" loans between the British banks, meant the rise since September, of 6.59%, after a constant rise since November 12.
England takes trial on the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important than the first trial against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is on loan- with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because Hugh Morris's desk, the director of England, is beginning to fill out offers to become a national selector, and if not, in a part time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth place of bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than for ability.
Not only in the cricket is the choice difficult, because judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it right for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but so do they have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to capture the captain's eye at the same time as taking a "wicket" and a batter to get opportunities to change order if he wants to have impact as a player someday.
But capturing the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who surely plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself to "fit and bowls" as the wind on the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their moments high and can expect more of them.
The games of Shah or Bopara in the stadium of Asgiriya can be only a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who became a major player, and despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, he may still be underrated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion in today's session at the Asgiriya stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah's greatest experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both of us.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut test of early 88 in Bombay, 32 first-class centenaries against only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent antecedents against spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten races in his two shifts in May against West Indias in the test at Lords, his home as Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, seemed to have taken some momentum from his "beating" than in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex's team has the joy of living in swords.
He is caught for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he turned his vehicle into an exhibition for England's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was to pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate looking at the distance, to say excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he strikes with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not excel, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who ran out of cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who led them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned on private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that's safe now."
"They say that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he says, referring to the Shiite militia of religious activist Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to cease for a moment.
Qassim al Atwani, 38-year-old Shiite and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an ally U.S. force helped get Al-Qaeda out of his bastion west of the capital, and urged him to come back.
One of Jordan's newcomers was the head of a Sunni Shiite tribe that had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after he urged the citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had begun an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my companions."
"That's why I'm back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since US troops strengthened groups of "concerned citizens", armed and working in cooperation with US military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many declared that they had returned because of the denial of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three children, voiced the common suspicion among the exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees' visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," Sunni said.
"I can't believe a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunni people have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will revive sectarian tensions and the struggle will begin.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sardinians lack only one educational field.
" Yesterday I explained for fifty-first time to a non-Sarlander that we are not French"- that was the ironic motorcycle over themselves from the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Saar education system, which in a study by the Institute of the German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" took the fifth place.
In this way, high schools by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
Saarbrücken University was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a bacillage.
"The system of vocational education is being used in the Saar," says Axel Plünnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute of the German Economy (IW).
More than every five young people do their high school at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Sarre is 7 percentage points above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the population number, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has dropped by one third in recent years.
That was why the Ministry of Education of Sarre forced the higher schools to make more publicity for the specialties of Engineering Sciences.
"After PISA's first study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
For children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of the students has increased.
According to the PISA report of 2003, the number of backward students in school development decreased from 29 per cent to 20 per cent.
But in general, Sarre didn't get much better than other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
The PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages to the detriment of the people of Sardinia, although in this field it could achieve good results.
Despite the fact that the Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory subject in the Secondary Education Institutes.
Chavez changes the time.
Next in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets the schedule change in the South American country by delaying the clock half an hour.
Chávez is now becoming a comic in Spain.
As the Venezuelan State Official Gazette has reported, according to the new law, the time will be at least four GMT hours.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States would impose an obligation on the world in its day by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighbouring country Colombia due to the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until Conservative Álvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is propelled by a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in which it was about the release of the hostages.
On Sunday Chávez criticized the decision that Uribe made has offended Venezuela.
There is also much talk in Spain about Chávez.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?", is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who felt annoyed by the continued interruptions by left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decrease in the real wage threatens German employees despite a strong conjuncture.
The experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real wage account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The fault of this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the stowage of food and energy prices," said the newspaper "Bild" Gustav Horn of the Macroeconomy and Research Institute of Economic Cycles.
The new unemployment insurance charges may also apply to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% from year to year is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the work office does not have to go back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German Social-Democratic Party.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil-derived sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to the Earth, something that had not so far been raised. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and tugs in the poles, the same ones that appear also in winter on the Earth.
For three decades now, researchers had suspected that there could be lightning in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it has discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays call from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on Earth: the storms could have provoked reactions in the ocean that, on the other hand, had given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it's not like that: if there was a life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface there are temperatures of 500°C, oscillating so that temperatures can be reached under zero.
"Possibly, Venus is a "diabolical" twin on Earth, but still a twin," Russell said.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since there were no special missions since the 1990s, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step in the investigation of Venus.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many "Nature" articles, according to researchers, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighboring planets have more common characteristics with the Earth than we had assumed," says ESA.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers discovered in the southern polar region also a vortex formed by the clouds that revolves faster.
This phenomenon recalls the wind flows in the high ground atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost so large.
This planet also called dawn star or evening star orbits around the Sun almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: a day in Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not resemble Earth very much, scientists are based on the fact that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets, water had been agglomerated that remained on Earth in the oceans, but on Venus it dissociated in the universe.
While carbon dioxide had become carbon stones on Earth, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end that fight for the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we must not present ourselves as A divided nation," Koehler said to the newspaper "Handelsblatt".
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy, stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach he received in carrying out a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional One China policy course.
China knows that too," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his displeasure at the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inactive foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to information sources from the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Head of Government, demanded the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept that European politicians would receive the Tibetan religious leader in their official position.
Dalai Lama's actions and words demonstrated that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that there will be disturbances such as those in France.
Battles with police on the streets, shooting, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case with France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move to the streets.
They were barricaded, the vandals shot the police with rifles: after serious riots involving young people in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Part of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar tendencies in Germany.
"We must also make sure that our country's social problems do not take the violent form."
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hannover.
Not all young people are involved in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing fruit."
It's still early to take the end of the alarm for granted.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The young people witnessed serious riots in the streets with the police north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Tolouse.
Kenan Kolat, President of the Turkish Community in Germany, called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
However, the proceedings are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 years of age is above the average.
More vocational training is needed.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give young people a perspective".
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families" than in the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat thinks, "But despite everything, we have to be careful."
It is necessary to "provide young people with the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training more quickly".
Meanwhile the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen participated in the action, a helicopter with lighthouses overflew the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burnt cars.
Since the previous day, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been working on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister for Home Affairs, announced that the police will take rigorous action until necessary.
The night of Monday to Tuesday about 80 policemen were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of young people was not the fault of the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The action far away from the reality of the Federal Chancellor shows that the coalition on content reached its last point and that nothing more needs to be expected of it.
But what country does the Chancellor really live in?
After her desperate action, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House, one must say: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by it.
As to the reproach he was made for having repeatedly devoted to foreign policy proceedings, the Chancellor rejected him with a presumptuous sentence.
He said that that would be a provincial way and thus he showed that he does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House, it was made very clear to all that this reproach was appropriate.
There could be neither a minimum interest nor any kind of feeling for the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs away from foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: she praised herself very much for the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but she does not say anything about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising oneself - for two years the leader of the Party of the Christian Democratic Union has not been able to afford so much modesty.
Well, he's working on expressions for people to get a boost.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke the inner problems are appearances of little value.
The poverty of children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
The only thing he is dedicated to is to talk about that subject using subordinate prayers.
It's amazing how many times you're wrong to talk when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favourites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, fought in a heated debate of Republican YouTube presidential pre-candidates and now they must fear only one candidate from the outside.
From the outset, tensions between candidates are evident.
Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for turning New York into "a refuge for illegal immigrants."
This, for its part, responded with serious reproach: "I meant that his own house was a "port" for the illegals." Giuliani replied to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as so far the Republican group does not have a clear favorite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate at CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, filmed by internet users who were sent to Youtube, also have not much content.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power," that was John McCain's reproach for his opponent Ron Paul, the only one from the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing the troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives many criticisms from Vietnam's war veterans, when he refuses to recognize "Waterboarding " as torture, a method of interrogation, by drowning a person simulates his death.
Public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that in the meantime the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised conservative values and denied the rise of taxes.
So you can see better where are the weaknesses of both favorites.
"At that time I was wrong," explains Romney comungido and asks for forgiveness from the people and the television audience for having been a defender of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf ruled without uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
That's how the eight years of military rule in Pakistan end.
On Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcasted the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his mandate as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after it was done with power with an incruited military coup, the former general ruled for the first time the state as civilian chief.
With his resignation from the post of Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and of the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the oath Musharraf will soon annul the state of emergency and will fulfill the second condition of the west.
Since it was proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there were many lawyers in favour of Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all the remedies before the controversial new elections of the head of government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watirist region, five soldiers died and four others were injured.
According to information from the military spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the Afghanistan border.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s follows its activity: three members of "Harmony" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release, a copy of "Live 1974" was made that was written at the best time in the band.
Already in those times they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each one of them has in front of him his box, his cables and above all his buttons.
In the middle he is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking at the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes with his sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's enthusiasts was the fact that the Harmony band was back making music.
What needs to be rebelled here is this: the questions precisely have shown that the name of the band was shrinking in people's minds, but it was not so special that after 32 years the public would miss it so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the misunderstanding Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to members of the Can 2003 band in Cologne for their work of life, the faces of German pop artists could be seen in the room.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouth with amazement.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times I did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job in Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the Neu band! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at the time was too radical.
In 1973, Rother followed Cluster's musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th century ruin, they lived as refugees of the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain of his position.
That was more of an artist's life full of surprises.
According to them, one day, an Ottenstein Harmony Association flag appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmony.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist was not just to know oneself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do it from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended up on esoteric issues and assured his existence with albums like Flammende Herzen.
Cluster revived the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmony had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that must be thanked to Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set itself as a goal to cultivate this German contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the Neu! band was again discovered.
Harmony's presentation as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all influences of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmony took the position of a super-band, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are photos where Harmony shows up with producers on a farm.
The story of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of black and white photos, where you see instruments with cables.
In the background, there are three veterans who began to improvise again.
They do nothing but attach microphones to the organ and battery so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects apparatuses that they had built with their own hands.
Today electronic music is just like it had to be.
Three people who deepen the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere he coughs, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis he sings "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always an English term of origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia keeps calm.
On the stage you think very well about what is already evident.
Where does it start and where does the music end?
That can break one's nerves or give you a few quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again devoted to war in the Balkans.
But the two of them didn't have much conviction.
Either the concepts are much focused on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the mountain of the Balkans, but right there, in the dark interior of the country during the war in Bosnia, was again discovered by actor Richard Gere.
We had finally lost sight of the handsomest man in the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and unimportant roles in women's films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do movie titles have to be so long and crazy nowadays?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: in the background, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the fate and the film industry hadn't been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life have passed, that as a monument to the ruin of his decadence had so far retained most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, turns out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
One can narrate the film "Moerderischer Frieden" in a nutshell: it is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm Fuer Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a situation of war.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" one can investigate, because in reality there was never a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard in two counts), the story about American reporters in the war going to detect a war criminal Serb called "Zorro", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and every time results in a trip in madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first they introduce us to Simon Hunt, to him whom they do not allow to be simply a cynical with heart.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Muslim Bosnian who will then kill.
Then "The Hunting Party" is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with an impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the world's headhunters could not achieve for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to get revenge in a fair way.
It's so bad, they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against kinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and emphasizes that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to mind a very famous poem from Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad."
In the movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not only the genre of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
It's almost always worth a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or minefields, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all of these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood rolls a good holocaust film with the film "The Schindler List" as an example.
Some films already need more time. Classics such as Vietnam War Works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our times every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two home televisions.
And that's because script authors don't have the slightest repair (which is necessary for power) in narrating good stories.
"Being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" turned out to be so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps you should be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look of an artist.
When they asked him about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That is only because some things never change."
The big cities will always be in danger, the men will always be killed cruelly and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives negative criticism of the Olympic Games as a response.
The Mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economy for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue fighting for the competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that it is necessary to be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Managing Director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, expressed this resignation on Wednesday as "not good for the economic site".
In the last time no other project in the big city encouraged as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal, the political, sporting impulse could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg's ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics were not to be realized until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but it is decided by the German Olympic Sports Federation," says von Beust at the WELT ONLINE.
It referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December on Munich's application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we would have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance."
Despite everything, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to let the opportunity be taken away, if the plans are now ruined," said HSB director Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application contradicts the statement made by the head of the senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Sports Federation of the higher schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for universities in 2015 not as a "substitution" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week did the Sports Federation of Higher Schools appoint Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) condemned the senate not to take advantage of the valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years, the Senate was delaying the development of the small neighborhood of Grassbrook, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social-Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required an integrated planning of Olympia for the little Grassbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU emphasized the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's application for the 2012 Summer Olympics gave rise to great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Who links the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks about Ikea, but does not think about Andy Warhol.
Or yes?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" Bright-Boxes on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" cast doubt on the authenticity of the 1968 Brillo-Boxes by Andy Warhol, the Museum Moderna Museet in Stockholm carried out internal investigations and reached disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the museum Pontus Hutén gave to the Museum Moderna Museet, are false, and almost a hundred of the others of " Stockholm type", which are in circulation in the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted the wooden boxes of red, blue and white, with the same show that they had cardboards of soap powder "Brillo".
According to Warhol, in the 1968 exhibition of his works at the Museum Moderna Museet hundreds of cardboard boxes were exhibited. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the cardboard factory of "Brillo".
These were not works of art, but specimens (which were only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden a Brillo-cajas of wood, but they were not exhibited in the Museum Modern Museet.
Witnesses of those times now speak of nearly fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the Stockholm type "Brillo-Boxes" authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were purchased for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already died for three years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Modern Museum Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and emulated their tight silvers and then painted them with oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the tight silvers. Moreover, it is not about oil painting, but about acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol's official Brillo-Boxes list," says Lars Nitttve, the director of the Museum Moderna Museet and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Commission in New York will not come to any conclusion, the Museum Moderna Museet will classify these six boxes as copies/objects of exhibition."
Already in July The Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" in which they are soap dust boxes.
But from that moment on, everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender to Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had fallen into a hotel in Manila had surrendered and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been squatting in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had a trial on Thursday for having attempted a coup in 2003 that ended in a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so he could suddenly deposit with about 30 sympathizers.
Obviously, the military police who were supposed to watch him had passed his ranks and followed his riot.
They entered the hotel "Peninsula" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Advisor, condemned the behaviour of the soldiers.
"People are sick," Trillanes said.
"We call people to come to our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the elite Scout Reangers troops, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The great critics of government called on Thursday for a great demonstration against the president.
For months his government has been reproached for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a place that attracted all the attention for the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines there have been at least seven attempts at coups d'état against democratically elected government.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder in Versatel.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the Versatel telecommunications company.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price for an action is 14, 46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There were many speculations about the company's absorption.
There are also the options to further increase the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market (Digital subscription line).
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entry into the business, after bank Brendenberg increased its participation to the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market this means that the financial institution maintains the participation certificates for a third partner.
United Internet already the day before made participation with almost 10 percent to the telecommunications company Drillisch.
Drillisch to the extent of capital expansion placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet has bought from them 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, companies began negotiations on DSL-product marketing cooperation.
"Let's strengthen our collaboration," said United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies founded an MSP joint venture to acquire the Freenet competitor.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at first, the two companies want to be happy with the participation of ten percent in Freenet and do not make use of their right, i.e., make participation to 18.49 percent of Freenet.
This meant that both companies maintained all the options, especially the participation in the anonymous Freenet company.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German market of Telecom.
At the end of the third trimester Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far the holding company of United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6.01 percent of the participation in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
