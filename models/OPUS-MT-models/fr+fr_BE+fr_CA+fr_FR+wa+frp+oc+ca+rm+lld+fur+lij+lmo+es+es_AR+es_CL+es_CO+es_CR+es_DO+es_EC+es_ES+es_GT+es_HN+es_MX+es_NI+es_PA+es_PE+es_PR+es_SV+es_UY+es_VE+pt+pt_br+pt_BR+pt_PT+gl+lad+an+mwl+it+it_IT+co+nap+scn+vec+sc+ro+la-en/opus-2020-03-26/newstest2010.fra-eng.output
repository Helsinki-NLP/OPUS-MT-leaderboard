Barack Obama will be the fourth American President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth American President in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
Among other things, the $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be handed over to him for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a busy program.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the very first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's planning then includes an interview with the King of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet its summit in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the prize in the Committee itself.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan when the prize was given.
The president does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he receives this prize by being a president who leads a war in two countries at the moment.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to emphasize.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of ten million Swedish kroner (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate it to charitable works, but he has not yet decided in concrete terms which ones.
His busy program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at that price at first.
He mentioned, for example, the feeling that he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
From the announcement, he stated that it would be an "invitation to act" for him.
A natural defender accused of blackmail
The police of Litoměřice accused the president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice of blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction works procedures and asked for money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesman for the police of Litoměřice.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and is at risk of imprisonment for up to three years.
Waste sorting bins are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packages, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on sorting bins at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take several minutes before finding the right bins.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort out the waste in Brno at all.
But I have the impression that the city councillors in our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of bins dedicated to these waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is a whole science, which requires mainly time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found for the moment is the Moravia square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't want it, but I don't think it's too much.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it's not a sinecure either.
So to finish, many of my friends don't sort out their waste.
By farce.
It makes them a slut to get to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any colored bins on Koicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing with it.
It's after all the center of Brno, who's supposed to represent the best city, right?!
It is probably that ecology and so-called aesthetics are not too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the city a first league hockey place that shames the city across the country, instead of buying some extra buckets and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to comfort my impression with official statistics after hanging out for a while on the internet.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravian region.
Paroubek's budget removed retirement money and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or public servants may lack money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on State debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and the Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make borrowings for sensitive expenses, retirements or sick leave. "It's just putting the problems back later, mining the ground," Janota said.
It is important to know that on borrowed money the interest to be paid is increasing and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state doesn't really have a choice to know where to get money.
If it does not reduce social aid or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those that the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater debt of the state - next year there will be no shortage of 163 billion in the caisses, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The state will need money to replenish it and it will no longer be enough to increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
It will also lack five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections that have already been decided and begun and which cannot be modified to reduce costs.
At most, keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping 30 major construction sites, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very well - it will draw on the dividends of the ČEZ (supplier and electric power distributor), which the state has in large part and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case a dead end.
Last year, it was 18 billion that were sailed from ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the reform of pensions that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GNP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to victims of communism and crimes, or even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the side of the department or, at worst, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a shortage of a hundred million dollars in the proposed two-billion-dollar state fund, which should allow for the online monitoring of the expenditures of each administration.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find any money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
Projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just one button and you move from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the objective of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of computer virtualization software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them as staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in an interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and it was made a first demonstration a few days ago.
He will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not a fictional matter.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now collaborating with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to devices during 2012.
The snow shortage in the mountains is troubling the hoteliers
The desert slopes are not a problem only for ski lift operators.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have many visits to our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they ask right away if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year's Eve of your dreams at Špindlerąv Mlýn, you better not hesitate to book any more.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation comes only later, then we can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler hoteliers are offering only one week's stay for the New Year.
I think they're going to try another time to place them, but they're going to give up, too, and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," said Jandura.
Ingtours du Vrchlabí Tourist Agency also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We're most interested in Christmas week at the moment, but it's not sold completely.
It's still free, let's say, half the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí Tourist Agency can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February go just as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays was negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the snowless mountain.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will also be complete," thinks Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We've got an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places left for New Year's Eve as well as Christmas.
There is a great deal of interest during the holidays of January of the Polish and February also sells well," informs Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also complete at eighty percent during the New Year's period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupation at the moment.
February is a little weaker for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will certainly grow again indicated the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
However, the hoteliers of the Krkonoše should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there are precipitation, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But then the weather should warm up, inform Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repetition Is Mother of Wisdom
It even becomes comical, the diligent effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of the wise, replicates his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan issue, which he considered to be very simple.
When he ended up letting his doctrine sweat so eagerly awaited, it turned out that he had copied it to carbon paper since Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text itself several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is more, to use the title of the Bush speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements to a civil war-burned Iraq as "irresponsibility and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to succeed to such an extent that the newspapers currently do not speak at all of Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that said, objectively speaking, he left his successor a much more favourable final situation than one could hope.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It was again the campaign commanders who called for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reluctance despite the habit of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, at least he scammed the general of 10,000 soldiers.
It has succeeded in removing the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though it originally had 10,000.
What brings the most problems in Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process within three years. Obama's entire doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that half an increase will bring the same fruits as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out by the exact opposite - no one can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
Under these circumstances, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, who are accustomed to changing their day-to-day leadership according to their arrangement.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will only remain dust in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is uniquely complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity about the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "prompt state to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporal horizon of Obama's strategy is perplexed by its voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "quick return home" will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will regard it as the indirect admission of the American defeat.
The latest NATO summit has shown that the Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the enhanced sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the Americans will find themselves faced with the very difficult question of solving the problem through the use of military force.
For example, we will have to respond when, according to Obama, America comes to the victorious withdrawal of Afghan troops.
Each such solution will, however, lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only trick for Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to plan on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will no longer receive cash premiums
The top-ranking employees of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 principal leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
Actions may be withdrawn from management if they take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to connect pay with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the overall meaning to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of critics after putting aside almost $17 billion for premiums over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters agency.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the strong premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intended to allocate the bankers' bonuses of more than 25,000 pounds with a single tax of fifty percent.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics
They are five women, a record number, who today received in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prize in technical disciplines and literature.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonah with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn't have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in fiber optics and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary award.
It reaches 10 million Swedish kroons in each category. (around 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward among themselves.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been presented this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, to US President Barack Obama.
The latter, in his speech, acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward, since he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the discharge of his policy he added that in some situations war is indispensable for achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who weighs his stay in the government due to his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday appointment.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further widens the public finance crisis.
President Radim Ochvat informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his role on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget to be submitted for the signature of Klaus, it is a deficit of 163 billion kroons that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, on Wednesday the Chamber of Deputies validated the Left's proposals on money transfers and increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Social Democrats for the fact that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement was born between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, disagreement that questions the future of Fischer's cabinet that had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as voted by the MPs, removes the package of economic measures passed by the government of Fischer, which he believes must stop the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but who has no obligation to do so, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irremely weak" of public finances.
Now there is, in his view, no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could improve, if it could build on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the President.
OSD President Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is frightening and that the government should call into question its future existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "dramatic verdicts".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is frightening and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD called the ratification of the state budget for the coming year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman is going to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that Hollywood Invictus - Invaincu's new film will expose a lot of things to the world about the country, its fights and its victories.
History speaks of sport, race-to-race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American Oscar-winning actor, embodies Nelson Mandela's film of life, tirelessly fighting the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said, that it was a mandela who was ninety-one years old who asked him to embody him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him: "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally..
The seventy-two-year-old actor who was rewarded with a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's million dollar baby drama in the middle of boxing, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery that became himself a slave, a fictional president of the United States, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone who is still alive and as important to so many people as is Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela newly elected knows that his country remains still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the world-class outsiders.
The South African team will eventually advance to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story on the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role so as to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to talk like him.
The actor stated that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shook your hand, I recovered your energy, it passed on and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor stated that he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look a lot bigger in the film'.
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the hood of the director Eastwood received positive opinions and we even talk about ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety summarized his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well made film."
In film evaluations at rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin was observed above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only recognized yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the "Bulava" missile that was originally to be the pride of the Russian army became progressively the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got hurt in the middle of a flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as the "missile that doesn't steal"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was conducted at the beginning normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the apparatus.
It's obviously the third-floor engine of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij that sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be justly fired from a moving and submerged boat
This is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably caused by a defective "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two stories of the rocket resisted and the damage affected only the third.
In the previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches went unattained, the Ministry of Defence's management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they therefore always say that one day "Bulava" will fly smoothly and that it will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at 51 years old
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will perform again in a professional match at 51 years old.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend strength to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably be joining the game on Friday against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at forty years in 1998, is currently the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details on the form, says the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the legendary hockey player's comeback will concern only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return on ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest professional Russian hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played for Hartford for a season and won 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most success.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he won twice gold at the Olympic Games, seven World Champion titles, he triumphed at the Canada Cup as well as at the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in NHL where he held the Stanley Cup twice.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime hours.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
Spokesman Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai plant confirmed it.
However, management wants to agree again with the unions on a Saturday worked this year again.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why volunteer overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
Sedmička.cz indicated that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech kroner to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on November 28th.
According to Vaněk, the company has decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they get the supplement for overtime, or they can put on a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their Vaněk-listed end-of-year holidays.
In addition to this all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and for their lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and warmest point in the comments and claims of trade unions as employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory were forced to work almost two hours a day in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the strike after the agreement has been signed.
The next negotiation between the management of the automobile plant and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař stated on Wednesday that they were prepared to cease strike in the event of agreement on their claims and the signing of a common document.
The situation at the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of unceasing overtime.
They were also protesting against the poor conditions of wages and so-called squabbles.
The management argued that employees had to work as an extra to meet the requirements for the production of automobiles.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the unions also asked that workers who have ceased production should not be subject to any sanctions.
Trade unions ask society to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a reward of 5,000 kroons (about €209) for these.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started production in series last year in November.
It has manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "endurant" HIV viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists test new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes, in some cases, the top on the fact that the combination does not deal as intensively with the common variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
However, the life of patients can be radically prolonged through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of HIV virus in the body.
Their consumption, however, results in a series of side effects.
Moreover, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what is called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of the researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of molecular mechanics of their links to the proteins of the virus.
Metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two cages with multiple walls are formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A traitoric and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of HIV virus caused by HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus will also be stopped in the patient's body, explaining the researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test pieces as well as on its resistant variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the common version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical medicinal products, but it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common medicinal products are often ineffective.
Metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications, are therefore interesting combinations to be explored further in order to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína İezáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fights around the budget. The ODS takes on Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek described the budget ratified for the following year as "failing", and according to him, Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should call into question its existence.
The Prime Minister described the SDO as a drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether to take up minority support in the Chamber of Deputies that is concerned with fighting the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the ODS and the Social Democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, but with proposals for amendments amounting to 12 billion kroons included by the left.
The House increased the money for civil servants' salaries, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance with the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The SDO left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that an amended budget be a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and inutility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment Monday with the Prime Minister after his visit to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering if he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the negotiations around the budget is the reason for this.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the ČSSD representatives, who have imposed changes in the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit, such as those that affect health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not at issue.
This is the case with the head of the Fischer government and the entire government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing harmful, Topolánek pointed out in a text release from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments were calling for TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the deficit in public finances, "it is quite logical and correct that he is based on the left - hand majority that is currently in the Chamber. "
That said, he must not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda then I will devote myself to it, said from the House to the journalists, Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a European Council debate in Brussels.
The SDO turned back at the Prime Minister's request.
Nečas pointed out at the same time that the SDO would probably have voted against the modified budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked the Democrats to allow the budget to be voted.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not small children, did he respond to the question of whether the SDO had not been reproached by the President of the Party in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew at the time when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a Bolshevikization of the House and a destruction of all that was positive, Topolánek reacted in person.
According to the new ČD schedules there will be less trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit some less loaded express or regional trains from 13 December and will strengthen some of them.
Total transport coverage will fall on the day of entry into force of the new two-percent schedule compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including base and reduced tariffs.
For example, it is the inhabitants of the Ostrava region that will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino branch.
On the contrary, an express stopped serving Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the direct Prague - Letohrad line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport is in the Hradec Králové region of eight per cent, while Prague and its environs can welcome an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the traffic of a few express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to just a few days in the week.
Among the greatest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main train station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will leave at two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino until Bratislava from 13 December.
The invoice this year for the regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year in a total of four billion kroons to settle visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate in almost three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a ten-year contract, so far the duration was still one year.
The railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they did not use a price increase of the vast majority of transport tickets.
Changes will only affect one-day ČD Net tickets and eLiška discounted internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the journey travelled, whereas up until then it was valid between cities of a region of choice and was at a single price of 160 kroner.
The Filipino rebels are still holding more than 50 people, the children have been released
The rebels today abducted 75 people south of the Philippines, including some primary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed about it, but that spoke at the origin of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human shields during a flight to the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New Popular Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers as a result of violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre linked to the election of the governor's administration there were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the South Philippines was arrested as a result of suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential lineage of the Ampatuan.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in the American halls in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and recounts part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the combatant against world-famous apartheid has returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the halls, the feedback of critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
By his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full preparation for the football world cup, and also because the media are stirred by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflict and discrimination of the people of the black majority in power.
According to AP agency, reactions to the new film are for the time being quite positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about the main roles where Hollywood stars "pavanize".
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the film by resuming his own terms.
I've dreamed of this long-term role and I've been well prepared.
I also met Nelson Mandela many times personally to be able - as they say - to recover from his energy, did he say at the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember through the film Mandela's personality and message.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each individual, he added.
Wear the rugby national team jersey
The film based on the story of the British writer John Carlin's novel being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his presidency term.
Morgan Freeman therefore tries during the film to collect two racial groups from a long divided population and as Nelson Mandela in 1995 he entered the national jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won at the time.
For showing up on the lawn in jersey, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been long ovationated fourteen years ago mainly from the white public and was recognized by white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in bringing people together again in one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
The South African whites, however, are skeptical, as recently stated in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire engulfed in the morning a transformer of the Čeps company of the distribution center near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman for the Ústí fire department, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn, but they reviewed their opinion and turned off the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the spokesman of Pavla Mandátova, the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission package.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known after the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity Čeps has not experienced anything similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electric power supplies have not been interrupted, ČEZ's spokesman for the North Bohemian Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova said, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire at the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electric energy from the transport sets to the distribution sets and lines of lines of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura will file a complaint for defamation against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, the owner of Student Agency, will now file a complaint for defamation against three democratic social prefects.
And concretely against Michal Hašek of the region of South Moravia, against Radko Martínka of the region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated it in Dvacet minute of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in some regions.
All the regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and claimed that we made the fine mouths, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves to do.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slanders about Student Agency, said Jančura at Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he indicated that he had evidence that no region had acted in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for this for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura's filing of a complaint represents the continuation of his media performance, which serves as a free advertisement for his company and for his person.
I am, of course, willing to defend my name and the name of my region and call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and resorts to false and false arguments about regional rail transport, Hašek says.
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million kroons in an advertisement that will mention the adverse approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he planned to take it back after New Year's Eve.
He stated that the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of about 150 billion kroons, without issuing tenders.
According to Jančura, such a way of acting is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to threats from a member of the ČSSD to Jančura.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is, but I won't say his name, Jančura said today at Radiožurnál.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcals will reverse old habits as early as January.
She will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already rising, saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals are high.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clarity in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for the children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination has started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will have to be paid for themselves.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the child's 3rd and 5th months.
Last year already, one quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcals.
Yet the parents paid 1600 crowns or more for a dose.
Immunization of the youngest requires four doses.
The specialists estimate that every year health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 kroner in doses of vaccine.
However, they save on the medical care that non-vaccinated children would require.
To date, the State has spent approximately 500 000 kroner per year on all vaccinations of children.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections such as meninges inflammation and blood poisoning.
According to hospital investigations, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age due to pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský said that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcals.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have at least been able to impose this.
I think it is a direction that must now be followed, said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the process of vaccination against pneumococcals.
We absolutely do not envisage it at the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeń.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Paediatrics, acknowledges that a vaccination based on volunteerata its defects.
If all children were vaccinated, a decrease in vaccination renewals could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional," says Cabrnochová.
The specialists predict that as early as next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Vaccination against pneumococcals also breaks because it is the first vaccination of children that is financed by insurance and not by the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves
This, however, is linked to the concerns of paediatric practitioners regarding the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to purchase vaccines through insurance, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
However, some Members were concerned that this would allow insurance to "deduct sums from health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to repay them.
It is estimated that pediatricians will have to invest nearly 40,000 kroner per month in vaccines individually, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Flight"
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of attempting to steal paintings worth $20 million ( GBP 12 million) from his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police stated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance of the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, aged 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press (AP) news agency.
AP quoted a police officer that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, Mr.Frazetta Jr, 52, claims to have been allowed by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied giving such permission, the agency said.
Labour is defending the increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the increase in tax and the reductions in expenditure announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about the deficit reduction by delaying his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted lightning by attacking low and average wages.
Its main proposals include an increase of 0.5% in Social Insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public wages starting in 2011.
The anger of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession that they are not responsible for and warned that "problems" were announced.
The reduction in social insurance - which will bring about GBP 3 billion per year - has made the world of companies angry, because he believes it is a tax on jobs while the objective should be a boost to the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than GBP 20,000 per year, will reach about 10 million workers.
Main items of the Pre-Budget Report
Social Insurance will increase further by 0.5% as of April 2011
The economy will fall even more than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers bonuses
The increase in corporation profits tax for small companies has been abandoned
Discount of taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person who wins GBP 30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and a person who wins GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190, while a person who wins GBP 10,000 per year will win GBP 110 more.
Ministers stated that their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 was "hard decisions" but stressed that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would weigh on the first 5 % of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, refuted an increase in the tax and pointed out that a decrease in spending was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important; they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely indispensable over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident and that the growth of the economy would start again at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts of economic growth - which will affect the amount to be borrowed and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - while the borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the preliminary estimate.
"Missed opportunity"'
The Conservatives who will launch a new advertising campaign this Thursday warning against the "debt crisis" of Labour, said that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, evading "cynically" difficult choices until after the elections - to be held in June 2010.
"They presented nothing significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary to the Treasury of the Ghost Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" Important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals that would result in a faster and greater reduction of the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money collected through increased taxes and reduced spending would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "built on wind".
Nick Robinson, BBC Political Editor, stated that the schedule of announcements - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda charges, with money simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is provided while people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish spending details beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that public spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The well-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Etudes Fiscales) stated that the Chancellor's figures imply substantial reductions in many areas in the future, including potentially transportation, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only delayed," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a fake pre-budget report. Markets realize it well."
FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, announced the American Embassy in Pakistan, at the BBC.
The FBI said he was investigating whether it was the same men who had been reported missing from their home in the US state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said he was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are detained," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, spokesman for the FBI, said the agency was aware of the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and if it is really the students who are missing," she said.
The Pakistan Embassy in Washington stated that the men had been arrested in a house owned by one of their uncles.
She said that the house was already under the supervision of the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused any comment on the arrests, reported the press agency Reuters, but said that the United States "must work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been reported missing from their homes by their families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuses"
In the last twenty years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the presidential election campaign of June.
One man mentioned in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another stated that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran denied previous criticism of its non-respect for human rights.
The authorities have stated that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's disputed election led to the largest public demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors say that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, states that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protesting against election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, in front of my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the candidate losing in the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he had been locked in a container with 75 others, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election unrest and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski trails built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn Bristol's site into a track for competitions.
The eventPiste in the Park (A track in the park) attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park runway, a small springboard preceded a 100m long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but that it was quite intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city shining down.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talent," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be abandoned at the meltdown.
Always them and us.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French don't like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study of a problem that has divided and concerned the country for fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book presents a much wider and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he wants not only to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country at the moment.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He is very well able to listen to and reproduce debates between teachers and students on issues that affect them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to obtain a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr Bowen generally agree with their lawyer counterparts of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which nowadays constitute a small part of Europe's Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and the secularity of French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how French politicians (and the intellectual elite guarding secularism so virulently) were really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing sail in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
A knowledge of the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then brave 14-year-old aspirer who only had to fight the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually one millionth of the surface needed for a free adult.The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green because of the algae that were pushing in its thick fur.

Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit motoski Indians use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alon Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating insight into what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphereists nor the oceanographers can accurately report the speed of the changes.
It's not a mistake to try.
At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th, the pioneering trips of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the relief changes below.
Satellite surveillance and probes on icebergs are a great help, but the biggest part of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by pressurized brine water fillets by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn"
Marines, among the 6,000 people who deposited crowns on the graves in Arlington
The first class of 19-year-old De'Angello Robinson made a seven-hour bus ride to lay a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about fallen soldiers.
If that happens to me, I want someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay crowns on the tombs of veterans in different sections of Arlington Ceremony Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Ceremony Cemetery Cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honour of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters have also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (Corons across America), which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery enArkansas Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery, in Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, stated that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her dead husband, a career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It's a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Entire in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extended hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose ancient tombs, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as the new tombs, said the organizers.
The mood was optimistic, while the children played and the couples held hands, carrying the fresh pine crowns on the gray tombs.
Each round crown had a dark green colour, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Close by, there was silence on Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals cried without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends stood in the cold air.
Some read with a loud voice the names engraved in the stone while others hung to see the small black and white information cards, plunged into the wet land for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many tears mothers on her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and had taken eight hours to gather on the grave of Marine GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget what we're free to do... my son paid for it, she said.
"A long time after I've disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American national arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American national who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, said the services of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The precise charges were not made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husbands and they are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but has always been denied permission.
The detention of an American national may increase tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that pursues a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of an official is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day of pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors to the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often need to communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the rare Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press attaché with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- free distribution of mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused person is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when both countries are beginning to start a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities identified an organization that was supposed to prepare a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this case would disassemble an important network of terrorist recruiters who are playing the Internet in search of radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube video website on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were led by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, al-Qaida's home and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence representative who was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men were not involved in the CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north-east becoming a refuge of terrorism.
They were considered undercover agents.
For this reason, they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed the condition of maintaining the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to obtain entry into al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are interviewed by the FBI -- emphasize the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists, in determining who to trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, U.S. intelligence services have been given priority to infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of barrier guards, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are being studied closely by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert from the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups must also pay increasing attention, in recent years in choosing the people they accept because US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than following their recruitment model than so many others have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen are calling for climate action
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked on the streets here on Saturday, demanding more action on the climate by negotiators working in the Bella Convention Center Congress Palace of the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day when little happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city, deploying signs in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, saying "The Earth says it has enough".
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the Danish top model and photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother's home country, Peru, opened her eyes to the devastating problems facing the country because of the impact of climate change that already takes place."
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the big march -- to pass the word and appeal to world leaders to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented protesters from coming too close to Bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented protesters from coming too close to Bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer-by who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing black masks and clothes lit several explosives near the main canal in Copenhagen which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were launching them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around TV screens to follow the walk, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's representative for climate.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "In fact, this is something I was not aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking could seem harmful or useful from the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or that they impair the freedom of others."
Test results reveal tenacious differences between breeds
Last week's federal report on mathematical results provided good news for public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the head offices, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much more advanced in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of Grade 4 white children (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. have increased, over the past two years, from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but those of their African-American classmates have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 points to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only from one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overall view over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results of children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the Director of Education Group Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) was propelled by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a not-for-profit group that defends equality in the education of the District.
I don't jump for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (Democratic side), Member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4 at Eaton Elementary (primary school).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown stated that the message of test results is that the city's middle schools (colleges) desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what's scary is that we don't spend enough time and energy on our middle schools.
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at pupils in the end classes of the elementary and early school cycles who did not integrate the bases of reading earlier in their school career and who are quite late compared to their peers.
Every day, the mathematics program for Kindergarten (maternal) classes in Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and experiences of real life, as they were put in place in the District by former manager Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply think that we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these lower-level students than the class, Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results in order to narrow the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at Berkeley University in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighbourhoods of Washington.
Therefore, this targeting can have political implications that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like other school superintendents, she's trying to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they come from, are assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap of success was the duration of the traditional public school, today 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "point of departure" to get a further increase in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise of the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistling.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and blinks a moment of the eyes at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other students from Grade 8 (4th) of the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of a new, impressed student than enthusiastic.
Super That's where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed who would like to study medicine, while the guide directed them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? she says thinking, when she was told the weak ratio law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to be visited by children during their three-day discovery journey and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to university:
The question is where.
Although this question still arises largely for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Hispanic of the "second generation" in five continued his studies in high school -- a remarkable success considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success is important, researchers say, they open the way to the next generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study battling claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
Many parents also set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them," said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela University Visit is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize college preparation programs that begin when students of low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent entering the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry obtains agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has succeeded in attracting important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, which has been overrun by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies returned with a stake in only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who put an auction has lost.
Two American companies obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, they have Asian and European companies that are opening the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum forum, an information website on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Concerns about security, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as US military troops retreated, have stopped US oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, says analysts.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged by their rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided technical advice, have returned empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., held by the state, has auctioned more on contracts than other companies and has left with important participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected auction companies made bids that were then compared to the baril rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the main al-Qaida organizers was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that an American missile, which struck along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, declared Friday by the U.S. counter-spionage authorities.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles thrown into their car on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan province, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
The local authorities claimed that the missiles had been fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA within the anarchist tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistan's secret civilian services, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
Authority officials stated that the suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained "totally shredded bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaida's military organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize plotting around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to keep the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority stated that Somali had made rapid progress in al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the American general public, but that does not diminish the threat he poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important figure of al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures from the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, says the site.
United Nations Special Envoy to Kabul Retires
The United Nations Special Envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate with allegations of widespread corruption during the United Nations-supported presidential elections.
Eide's departure came as the Obama administration decided to send an additional 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he did not resign but would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
The representatives stated that the name of Staffan di Mistura had been cited; it was a citizen of Italo-Switzerland who had recently presided over a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who had previously led the United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which he thanked -- "have harmed the mission because there was already a good amount of skepticism about the international observation of elections."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged United Nations officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than he was assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed his frustration at the limitations of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy United Nations recruitment regulations impeded his ability to bring new talent.
The United Nations rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must be subject to additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the great world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a 300-strong U.S. midfielder in northern Iraq, during a week-long visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, devastated the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a breakthrough."
One of the things that weighs me the most is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it is indeed the unpredictable side inherent in war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He stated that a "set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be in less security with nuclear weapons" because "its people would suffer enormously from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme back in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he said that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of his storage of enriched uranium, in exchange for the desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a way to build trust on both sides and to save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have strayed from attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because Iran's leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran's raid on some of the international community's proposals for which they had actually agreed in early October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in on what they had not envisaged, in terms of substantial additional sanctions against Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set December 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement on Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world Powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying for the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet the Troops' Leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
There are still tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income-sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in US plans to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wishes to calm the anxiety of the Kurds regarding the outstanding withdrawal. US authorities quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you."
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by posters of propaganda featuring them, "The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An additional baby is an extra grave".
They have learned so well the lesson that the Shanghai Government authorities, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and the ageing population, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction has been instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to one child.
We don't have any seconds left, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources, who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the unique child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 per cent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission) said that fertile couples should have babies "to help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a lack of labour in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the only child is, without question, the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have given the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced pregnant women of a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high male-girl ratio.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and slide leaflets under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those wishing to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although leaders in a rural city in the suburbs of Shanghai say that they saw an increase in applications for couples wishing for a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still projected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the Municipality of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed to have two children.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly consider the single child's policy to be a problem of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with seven months of the first child of the couple.
That's right, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
That's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she only wanted a single child because she was one of her own. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us."
We don't usually take care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company says so more and more.
For middle-class couples who lower the birth rate, he says, it is necessary to be selfish in order to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 have grown up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even one child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
United Nations Group has draft emission reduction plans
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- which has so far been characterized by disorganized allocations and mutual recriminations -- has returned to the ramp fire on Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the coming years.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as far as it shed light on the way forward.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that are short of time, with more than 100 leaders from all over the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Drafted by a United Nations ad hoc working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor in order to withstand global warming, both in the run and in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN Executive Secretary on climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as "the complete picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations took place, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, United States Representative for Climate Negotiation, rejected any discussion that required the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to voluntary efforts by major emerging economies, if not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration becomes harder towards China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions from the major developing countries, Stern said, which also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments one hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei said that the main American negotiator, either lacked "good sense", was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not financially help China to fight climate warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, defects have emerged both in the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States complaining about their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers were fighting to find out who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters responsible for their actions.
This is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, Ulate said, which is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the European Commission's climate unit, said that the action of small island states "has put political pressure on the complete political process", in part by what they are now unified and that they ask emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister of the Indian Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Deputy Minister of China descended from their aircraft and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend meetings in the city halls and information conferences, in order to be able to make claims that will be considered during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- in which 13,000 people enter and leave the Congress Hall every day -- guitarists present night shows mocking countries that, according to them, betray each other and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of governments will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the court of the greats, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice-president for the global policy of International Conservation said.
Heavy trucks are coming.
In Great Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5:13 a.m., Monday morning, a whistle will come through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h, as it leaves Ashford, Kent, London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
He hoped that the new service would enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and link the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland in London.
Small holes lost will become thriving suburban cities, business travel times will be much shorter, and the passage of the plane and car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and the fears of environmental hazards could curb British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a larger high-speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west of the Pennines in Manchester and Scotland and another heading northeast, towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When it is finished, travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour's journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK's network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m long and capable of transporting 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts state that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes that the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to drive off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a passage from aircraft to trains, which is a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay the loan of GBP 75,000 for the Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the main member of the Tory Parliament, has paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of an orangery he built in his home in his constituency.
The party leader who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of the parliament were "maintained," increased his loan by GBP 75,000 to build a oak extension at his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to charge the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The authorities of the Commons received the complaints at that time and were not interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a control of the members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan stated that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the emoluments office claims that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan has not been asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on Common Privileges and Standards concerning its prior borrowing provisions.
The Committee innocentd him last month of any charge of non-compliance after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the loan of GBP 271,406 of his London property to the home of his constituency he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately GBP 1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March of last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75,000.
The variable standard interest rate RBS rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without ever moving since then.
The latest publication by the authorities of the Commons shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim GBP 1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as head of the ghost cabinet in September, after a covert journalist filmed him saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the expense scandal.
"In fact, it is now national, you have to live "on budget" and you are treated as "of the m...e"
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked a hell of a lot more, but I didn't."
The member of Parliament, a millionaire since his former post as an oil dealer, began to have to explain his expenses in May after it appeared that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the office of expenses that this "may be considered excessive".
An activist dug a £-shaped hole in M Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed that he had asked for £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing, last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved both by the fee office and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of hijacking or developing or using rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn't be clearer or simpler."
Faithful, come all to see the calendar of Brighton's Advent
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their booth for each day of December, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m., each day, with cakes and hot wine served free of charge.
Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the booth presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a television marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest from the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the Church should approach people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the Advent calendar of the beach cabin came right after a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people protested on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate change, throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police conducted several hundred inquiries.
At least 30 thousand people, according to the police, about 100 thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Conference, which will reach an agreement by Friday, which can enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the climate conference, the growing mobilization of climate throughout the world, illustrated by these events, has helped to make the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
Incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the procession, when a group of 300 protesters, entirely dressed in black, broke windows with beatings of pavements and hammers, observed an AFP journalist.
Anti-shock police immediately intervened without a household.
In total, the police announced an inquiry of 600 to 700 people, mainly Black Blocks members, who had illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", stressing that about 100 of them "were still held in the street on Saturday night "mennitated and held in a sitting position despite the extreme cold".
Party of Parliament, the procession, rather good child, took over the Bella Center, site of negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building, without trying to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the intended speakers, before a candlelight with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come in because and in the major cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof sky blue, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are going down the streets to seek compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a philippine activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
One cannot continue to say: we have time, estimated the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, rivers where we can walk like we've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alter-globalist movement has approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, went down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, with bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, gatherings of a few hundred protesters have also been held to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, a few dozen people gathered.
The separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
On Saturday, Abkhazia elected its president, a little over a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounced a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
These elections are farce.
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world regards it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in Soukhoumi, the capital, in a nice white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the Black Sea.
Wide panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to the Russian officials who came to monitor the conduct of the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, in reference to the support of Moscow, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented by the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements reached with Moscow last year, such as the one giving control over the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims not to support either the current power or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: events around the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people walked around the world on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on-the-live, arrested nearly 700 people on the margins of an impressive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about one hundred thousand according to the organizers, paraded in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts until 18 December delegates from 193 countries, seeking an agreement that will have to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Party of Parliament, the procession, generally good child, took the leadership of the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the centre, without trying to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the intended speakers, before a candlelight with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the procession left, a group of a few hundred protesters, entirely dressed in black, equipped with bricks and hammers, broke windows, observed an AFP journalist.
Police riots immediately encircled them and intervened without a household, throwing several of them on the ground.
The police announced the inquiry of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of "Black Blocks", these ultra-violent groups that had illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a policeman was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned down near a squat in incidents that led to the questioning of about 20 people, according to the police.
We looked at extremist groups, warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while law enforcement helicopters were turning into the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came by car and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof sky blue, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are going down the streets to seek compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a philippine activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
One cannot continue to say: we have time, estimated the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry in Africa, there are streams where you can walk while you've never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alter-globalist movement has approached environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam mobilized several personalities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen, the former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who had to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, went down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, gatherings of a few hundred protesters also took place to demand action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, a few dozen people gathered.
The geo-history is reinforced by the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD Sunday that history and geography came out "reinforced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in scientific terminal.
From now on, first-rate students will all have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "it is necessary to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S-track is no longer a scientific channel" but "in general, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L channels cannot remain sub-filers of the S, he continues, pointing out again: "I also did not hear many historians and intellectuals indignant about the absence of the history-geography terminal in technological high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop survey published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to remove compulsory education from the history-geography in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this deletion, as well as the left and some right-wing elected ones.
On the other hand, the minister added that it was "no question" to delete the philosophy of the terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrificed the educational training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will address their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will address their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also follow internships in the M2 year and will be a first year in front of students as intern teachers.
If you add all the courses offered before the competition, you already get more presence before the students, that is more than 300 hours, did he continue.
Finally, the Minister states that he will propose "individual right to training, which does not exist in National Education".
It also reaffirms the plan to remove the school card "by 2012".
In Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC), invited by the Upper Normal School of Ulm Street, met on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of expert speeches, fifteen minutes each, filmed and open to the public, observed a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the margins of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day that draws his name from the one given by the students to the fish in the school basin.
Some 20 speakers were selected from among the experts in their disciplines and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
About climate warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but using graphics, in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
The videos from these conferences will be posted on the school website as of December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delays in payments: anger of prison overseers, planned actions
The unions of prison overseers called on Friday for "general mobilization" to demand payment by the end-of-year holidays of bonuses and overtime whose payment was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd supervisory union) has asked staff who will not be on duty to protest Tuesday morning in front of prisons and to "block" them, to "denunciate the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls on them "to meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", judging "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "extra hours, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of overseers, the federal autonomous prison union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to bring up discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime has increased significantly in 2009 and not all have been budgeted, but ensure that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellery indicated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the prison administration management to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arises from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours in the future, adds Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be slim, except for management staff receiving the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints have a good back".
It is a scandal, the interregional FO union of Marseille was outraged, announcing its decision to boycott until further order "all meetings and summonses".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, same for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
As we increase our tasks and our missions without increasing our numbers, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff's money, estimates the CGT-penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less poor than others.
But in any case the account is not there, noted the secretary general of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "tricks more nice" than the ones he receives
American President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas with his family at the White House, told the "paper" on the little Oprah Winfrey screen that he had a simple gift rule: "I give things better than the ones I get."
As part of a special program that will be broadcast on ABC Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end of the year celebrations in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be part of the game.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama made a false statement against her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he received: "I certainly didn't offer you nice gifts last year," the president said.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before humbly replicating by fingering the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who offered you this?"
During this one-hour show, in a relaxed atmosphere, with the famous cheerleader who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a 10-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and gave me a basketball, the president said.
It was only a lot later in my life that I realized it was him who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange it around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reworked, RTL claims he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reworked in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reworked in the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found "injuries resulting from the operation" of the hernia discal suffered in Paris on 26 November, told Paris his press service, stating that these injuries had "need a restorative operation".
However, the singer's press service wanted to reassure itself that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be issued no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, a partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday would have been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, adds RTL.
Asked by the AFP, the press service neither confirmed nor commented on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of the Parc Monceau for this herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
This was not available on Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following his surgery on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the surgery.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, estimated on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured himself not to "get any trouble" for the rocker, which is "a fighter".
He called me right before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because making twelve hours of plane after such an operation, it's not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, had wanted to reassure himself, stating that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily with antibiotics" and that the infection was "inhibited".
Mr. Camus had also said that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had had "a small colon cancer" and then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been greatly commented upon. Fans and journalists have noticed the singer's difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: the first Bousquet on its fetish distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medallist at the Worlds-2009 in the big pool, won an international title on Thursday on a distance that he particularly fondles, the 50 m free swim, during the Euro-2009 in small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while waiting for a rollover.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relays men 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who stood on the world record of the 50 m free, whose mark he held in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50 m free, it is the 28-year-old Frenchman who imposed himself in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world brand (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better and in the office, I had said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be banned from January 1.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of combinations this time did not serve the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the big pool this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the mark he holds over 400 m free swimming (3:32.77) but nevertheless imposed himself by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't really give up on this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola awarded USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged in particular to French writer Emile Zola was awarded Thursday $1.5 million, well above his estimate, announced the art merchant Sotheby's.
This front panel two meters long by 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysiac scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world", explained to the AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice-president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still in progress but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have bid the most so far, told the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bath in her particular Parisian hotel, and at Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before the accession to the power of Marshal Pétain.
There was still a shadow zone of about fifty years.
By searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Attempted abortion of Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer on its territory of the fallen president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied a safe-conduct by the Putschist government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not combined, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived Wednesday in Salvador to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government aircraft returned to his place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General for Migration.
The Putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and apply for political asylum abroad to grant him a safe driving.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as the guest head of state.
The Putschist government "has experienced a new failure by wanting me to give up my charge (...), they wanted me to resign," said Mr. Zelaya on Globo Radio, on Thursday, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has been going on for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some agreements the fallen president, refugee at the Embassy of Brazil of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican Embassy has submitted a request for safe driving, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, said the Minister of the Interior of the Putschist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, on Honduran radio HRN.
I do not ask for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya had replied in an interview to the Telesur channel, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras would have to take place as President of the Honduran people, he had emphasized.
The rumors of Mr. Zelaya's departure had mobilised on Wednesday the supporters of the fallen president, who came to gather around the Embassy of Brazil, where the military strengthened their headquarters.
Brazil's Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the putschist government's position.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, the day he had organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he had returned by surprise on 21 September and had taken refuge at the Brazilian Embassy.
If he goes out, he will be arrested for the "high treason" offence of which he accuses the justice, according to the Putschist government.
President Putschiste Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on 27 January.
Wall Street climbs, the US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with US trade balance figures showing the resumption of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Warning advanced from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance, from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index was awarded 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza, from FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, believing that the market was focusing on "half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the American trade balance, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit declined in October by 7.6% compared to September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected to reverse a widening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth of trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners in the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new job registrations in the United States have increased against all expectations last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But over the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller, from Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday night and the yield of the 30-year bond increased to 4.492% compared to 4.408% on the previous day.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power conjure up the "Ladies in White"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government conspired on Thursday with the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which about ten dissidents were arrested.
Some 40 "Ladies in White", wives or close to political prisoners, were conjectured on the street by supporters of the Raul Castro government as they marched to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, one AFP journalist observed.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to revolutionaries!", "Vive Fidel and Raul!" chanted, the fist lifted, the supporters of power to dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian officers who came "to ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration took place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, about ten dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for the international human rights day were interrogated by police officers in civilian detention, a journalist from the AFP observed.
Police forcefully forced dissidents into civilian vehicles, who were conjectured by government supporters, according to this journalist.
Interpellations of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march "to demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain under lockdown.
The Cuban authorities regard opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" to the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Very rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
Forced man kills an octagen with a knife and hurts five in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed force of two knives killed an octogenary and wounded five other people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of influx, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor allegedly struck with two knives and for indeterminate reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy on 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, was learned from police sources and from witnesses.
Grievously wounded, the old man, born in 1929, according to a head of the Alliance police union, died in the hospital following his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then approached a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, about thirty years old, stepped in and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian succumbed.
The days of the other injured are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became ill and was reportedly hospitalized "in shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who appeared under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then have fled into the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He allegedly injured two passers-by, apparently at random: a thirty-year-old and a quadrantary, the latter seriously.
The scenario was confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he wore on the cross behind his back, explained on the spot a leader of the Alliance union in the Upper Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies gathered by the AFP, tried to control the forced one.
I saw a guy about thirty years old with a green jacket.
Three youths tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was tough, said Alberto, server of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Also boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No.61, two municipal police officers, including their head, tried to interview the armed man and were injured with fists, according to police sources.
The facts have occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Some passersby came to tell me there was a wounded person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later a second person came in about thirty years old, injured by stab wounds.
It was the National Police who arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office seized the investigation from the Hauts-de-Seine Judicial Police Department (SDPJ 92).
Forced man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not rule out him being interned in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all the forces of this species whose forces are increasing under the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls again for the abandonment of prosecutions
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again claimed Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), the abandonment of the lawsuits against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a case of morale of more than 30 years old.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of the "Pianist", denounced serious procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977 before three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeal.
I demand the abandonment of the charges here and now, Mr. Hummel said, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has been dead since -- would have discussed, before making his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to be imprisoned -- which is a serious lack of procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Wished" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had lied to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to give up the proceedings, Mr. Hummel called for a trial to be held, which would allow him to present the evidence of his case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, that no abandonment of charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was pronounced, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
He's never been back in the United States since.
The Assistant District Attorney for Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing."
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to flee?, Ms. Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "asks the court for a favor, while disregarding her authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed "there were other alternatives to escape."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one asking for the abandonment of the lawsuit against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also called for the end of the proceedings once again.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed at every rebound in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to residence in his Gstaad chalet, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, restrained by the increase of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market drawn between better indicators than expected in the United States and the increase in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Warning has risen from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, with technological dominance, has dropped from 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of exchanges has become very low and I think that will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend has been supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "have helped to improve the market's opinion on the soundness of economic recovery", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and much more than expected.
The confidence of U.S. consumers also improved significantly in December, to 73.4 compared to 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been restrained by a further increase in the dollar, at the highest for two months in the face of the euro, which "turns down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick of the Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday night and the yield of the 30-year bond increased to 4.497% compared to 4.492% on the previous day.
Miss World's election again in South Africa
After a month of traveling across South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are about to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already picked up their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Sports Miss or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I have seen so many things and lived so many experiences!, exclaimed Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to give back my crown.
This experience has been fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the Southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery "of breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became the stars of Bollywood.
It's every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launches Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by a television presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a head of the Miss World Steve Douglas committee.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to match, says Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
The candidates have as last year made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
I'm not running for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone notes.
Their most beautiful memory will undoubtedly remain the draw of fate in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup football in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been with people I never thought I could get close to.
I'm definitely coming back for the 2010 World Cup, excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," assured his son David on Friday upon his arrival at the Los Angeles airport where he was to go to his father's bedside hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's going very well, said to the press David Hallyday on his way out of the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1300 locals (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured that he would go "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a hernia discal on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by the doctors at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a distal hernia on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be reworked in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went on Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is educated, to attend a school show, found a photographer from the AFP.
The head of orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who performed the singer on 26 November at the International Clinic of Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible future judicial process, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus estimated that Johnny Hallyday was "going too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it had amazed me, since I myself had two hernia discs, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "party without drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma following brain haemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulfide reputation, repeatedly condemned by the courts, in cases of medical liability, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the order of doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of Order, and who is "nothing to be recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubi.
He indicated that the intervention had "perfectly been carried out" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The association UDF raises the tone and adds the New Centre to no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem, responded on Friday to the attempt by OPA of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardian party, to stop using it on any media, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the sign UDF, believing that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand for being the first to deposit it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday night, the UDF's office, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not intend to let themselves be dispossessed, came out of silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and the MP, adding that they would no longer use the sign and pass on the brand's property to them, under penalty of prosecution.
In recent days, you have multiplied the statements indicating that you are going to propose to your political movement to +reprendere+ the acronym UDF, written by the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it was good to follow on your militant material and on your website's guard page, the name of this movement, the +New center+, today's slogan + the UDF+, also notice the signatories of the mail.
As you don't know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office that says the NC to remove "immediately mention the name of the UDF from any media as well as from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transmit the property of (the) mark to its legitimate beneficiaries".
If you did not do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
In their letters, they stated that the UDF "has been a full political movement since 1978" and recalled that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, he continues the office, "when he filed the mark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
He takes scandalously and fraudulently advantage of the acronym UDF's absence of deposit to carry it out on his behalf.
This indelicacy is becoming a crime, they denounce, before ironizing on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for itself than to try to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which we are not entitled".
Case Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The Nanterre court decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine, if, as accused by the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenary to spoil her of part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be tried on 15-16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of €375,000.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are torn apart while holding the reins of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87, should be conducted by three physicians.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed on Friday will be required to submit a report by March 10, 2010, including whether Liliane Bettencourt has been able to be in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she'll submit to it.
I'm going to talk to him about it, said at the hearing, Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...) The expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been prosecuting the criminal charges against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and a touch-for-all artist, whom she accuses of taking advantage for years of her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or masterboards.
Liliane Bettencourt, for her part, has always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-time friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers' action, counsel's pleadings sometimes turned to large family disembarkation on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters from her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: "Can you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since she was married."
For her part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office again found that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a guardianship judge has refused in recent days to grant her application to initiate a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial took place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile.
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of large enterprises towards its employees has been reminiscent of the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers prior to the marketing revolution: it is a question of making employees adhere to "values" determined from above as it used to be, of imposing on consumers products designed by the technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering markets in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products from customer preference factors comes back regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to lethal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the part of a much more general phenomenon that affects managers in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the enterprise, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that authoritarian management revenues totally contradict.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would involve putting employees at the centre of the company's concerns in the same way as the customer.
The all-relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally happens, after many turns, to do what it has always done.
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As a result of major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old Behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the U.S. "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without them, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "leviers" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr comforts the leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, inadequate to today's world.
Identifying and Measuring Engagement Factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of incorporating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of realizing part of their dreams, ambitions, and projects.
Currently, only studies from the Motifunctional Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and return their human resources management "to the place".
They thus create a ground for the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: "Just War" Worth Praises Right to Obama
The American right wing welcomed the speech delivered yesterday in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had brocarded the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former Vice-President candidate in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Mrs Palin, the egery of the right wing of the Republican party, in the daily USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the theme of the war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
The war is of course the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop these terrorists all over there, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done Oslo "very good work."
I found the speech to be very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this all-in-historic speech, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Committee that "they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's former pen, re-converted columnist at the Washington Post, Mr. Obama delivered "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does," "he spoke as an American president," reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," said Gerson.
Among the few to the right not to be convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "ternal, ampouled and uninspired" on the National Review Online site.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich alarmed himself to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When we wrap the war in the notion of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained laudable in the President's place.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was prematurely awarded to Obama, described his speech as "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," ignited California's daily life.
Obama "made the right speech," the New York Times said, judging him as "both dark and edifying."
Routers: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organization to have remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that puts an end to the word of order of strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, started on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left early in the morning on Friday, hoping to sign the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And even if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTHER) had slammed the door.
But it took even more than six hours for a meeting to begin at 11 a.m. so that everyone would agree and at 6 p.m. the text would be signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to companies" and "it was to be feared that he would come to disturb the holidays of the end of years," said Mr.Bussereau.
The text provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
At hourly rates, for low wages, "we move from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It's no big deal, but we're going a long way, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
We're going to order our militants not to block, not to block refueling centers.
But we can always have some recalcitrants that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant increases on high wages in the light of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel costs by 3%, and the maintenance of general road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, inter alia, address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of EUR 100 million in employers' fees" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 draft amending finance law, which was voted on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same term".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to companies affiliated to TLF and, secondly, to the entire profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible", said Mr.Bussereau.
Opposition by employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dupes market", because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the turkey eaters of the next wake, deplored the Unostra.
For the Other, the agreement risks "exploiting the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disruptions on the RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day of strike between unions and RATP management left them hungry about their premium demand.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will be only trains between 10am and 8pm, due to one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains outside the central section.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which wait for 200,000 customers each day, welcomed the fact that "RATP makes efforts to serve major stores".
The RER Crossing from the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains circled at peak hours, and almost no trains in peak hours, as expected.
Like Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the Francilians having organized themselves.
Thus in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially due to the absence of college students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "an hour thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive on time".
Saint-Lazare railway station did not experience saturation, the SNCF indicated, which had provided for the supervision of law enforcement officers and forces.
The RER A operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left Saint-Lazare train station to reach the metros.
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, which are considered "senior" by the unions, of a meeting with the management Friday afternoon.
The Director of RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, which claim a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even put its bonus proposals in parentheses, outraged the CGT, pointing out that the management "did not fail to solve a problem while in the highways and SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", the RATP said.
This also made the unions say that the company "gathered from the users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, who had so far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in a concern of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B on Tuesday, following the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions ask for a bonus of 120 euros (Unsa) at 150 euros, of which 30 euros (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the million daily travellers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their careers, reach 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of bonuses, for staggered hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Justice Dissolves Pro-Kurde Party, Heavy Decision of Consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court declared Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-eastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "foyer of activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", told the press the President of the Hasim Kiliç Court, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to rule the dissolution, said Mr Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including President Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as non-label parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya Court of Cassation, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, ensures that it has no "organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict comes when the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to tarnish the support of the Kurds to the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leaders had stated that a dissolution could lead to an upsurge in tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
As soon as justice was announced, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the south-east populated by the majority of Kurds.
The forces of law and order fired tear grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw molotov cocktails or stones, with frons.
Some 100 people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the Justice decision would "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this question (Kurde, ndlr) by banning a party, he said to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
One can, of course, expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the head of the road clearance and sandblasting service (FES) says that this is not to bother citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the vehicle technique and learn to control them well.
And according to the meterologists, it might be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to attack snow and ice.
The FES follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr Brauburger explained that as soon as it started snowing on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures fell below zero, large sandblasting vehicles travelled 20 main routes (called A routes).
This includes streets with high traffic, main arteries, such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloped streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 km of road must be salted with a road base that adheres well, within 3 hours of maximum time.
That's why the FES service starts at 3:00 in the morning "so that the roads are cleared when the daily migration traffic begins".
That's when the snow starts falling at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the person responsible for the clearing and sanding service of the roads "because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, if it no longer snows, you will take care of the access roads and the service roads - like the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The secondary lanes and the side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger is well aware that this always causes a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES Pedestrian Team is on its way to identify areas deemed dangerous and crossings as a matter of priority.
As for bicycle tracks, the services of the FES are generally not able to handle them.
Mr. Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the state of the bridges between 22 hours and 4.30 hours.
As the ice is formed very quickly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles act as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also use this special service in case of need.
The birthplace of dinosaurs
The Tawa found was similar to the other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipede was about 2 meters long for 1.50m high, its posterior limbs were powerful, its skull elongated was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with claws in faucilla and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as reported by Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine, the Tawa found is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the lands of the supercontinent, the Pangea and was located towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa illuminates the evolution of the first dinosaurs of a new day.
In fact, he informs us of the relationship, the distribution and characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt began excavations with other paleontologists, on the site of Gohst Ranch north of New Mexico
Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History of Utah and member of the excavation team tells that sometimes they could find a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named it Tawa's name according to the word of the Hopi Indians for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a very exceptional discovery: the fossils of dinosaurs from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some fragments of incomplete bones.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he points out that it allows to confirm certain theories regarding the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the first dinosaurs.
The experts wonder, among other things, at what time the saurians divided into three major evolution groups: the theropods (carnivores) that include the tyrannosaurus and the veciraptor that appeared later and which descend the birds, the sauropods, quadrupeds on the long neck, and those related to them and the Ornithischian herbivores of which are part the species such as the triratops and the stegosaurus.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, said S. Nesbitt.
Researchers found clues that suggest that the Tawa found small air bags in his bones at the skull level, as well as birds that are the descendants of the theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It appears that in Tawa found, vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air bags in its bones.
As the related lineage of the immense sauropods also had air bags and a light bone, it may be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three major evolution lines have divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e., all of the lands that emerged that formed the Pangea supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the paleontologists team also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, advance the researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History of New York and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the Silesaura, that lived in present-day Poland and that belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give an erroneous view because in South America there are a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved while virtually none of them are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how have dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era as they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, still remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Trias dinosaurs spread throughout the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction at which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or else, dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favorite meteorite flourished by a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and which since then had been in the shadows: they were mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those in charge of courses at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by police of the casino of the J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt makes waves all over the world.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with protest students at the Westend Campus.
In a statement in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police called for by the university's steering committee.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had the buildings occupied by the students and teachers on strike evacuated after walls and works of art were barred from graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories considered that the degradation did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation is an "unacceptable breach" of freedom of research and education.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and tries to make the reasons for mobilization forget.
The University's Steering Committee has thus withdrawn from the discussions that would be indispensable.
The courts require that the criminal proceedings instituted be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the degradation.
Legitimation of protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union in the service sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity among students.
Protests are only the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Regional Secretary of Youth of the Verdi Union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took the lead in the action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and deterioration of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the regional parliament in Wiesbaden last Thursday on the television show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, expressed the CDU MP of the Peter Beuth Regional Parliament.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left (day Linke) did not share this view.
CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about students' arguments and claims, they are being evacuated.
The La Gauche party tabled a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions for police intervention.
The new Silicon-valley
For a long time she had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from central Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important micro- and nanoelectronic production and research sites are located there.
As of September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, a place of Franciscan science – with academic institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a "Protocol of Close Collaboration".
The signatories were Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz Head of Project Section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose main focus is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a lasting scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet institutes and research societies.
There are the Moscow Electrotechnical Institute, the great companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills in which the research centres are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The extent of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed high enough.
For his supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
S21, it is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Bade-Württemberg into a desperate chaos of construction sites for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Line-head stations, with tracks that ended in the middle of the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th century transport technique that were the effect of modern rail traffic brake sabot because it took a long time to move the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what we have to do.
That is why the railway stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart also: a train crossing station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Magistrale of the rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava from which the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost, to bury the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, line-head stations no longer really pose entry and exit problems since there are modern trains, reversible with autorails and pilot car at both ends.
However, we are now launching the construction of Stuttgart 21 next to the new layout of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
Regional and communal policies have taken over.
The railway company is part of this because it is the taxpayer who costs the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphs of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the expansion of the section are designed for a traffic of people that was attributed - and this is typical of the 1980s - to enormous growth.
At the time there was not yet competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new layout, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, EUR 6 billion will be swallowed up in the Souabe project.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be lacking for other points of junction and congestion in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the section across the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press the mushroom thoroughly here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking sabot.
The Rhine Valley route is about to become the bottleneck of international freight traffic, which is in the heart of Europe.
Government looks at the judgment rendered regarding the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Government of the Land referred to the possibility of resorting to the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Court concerning the prohibition of night air flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had mandated experts to review from a legal point of view the judgement rendered by the Administrative Tribunal and that it is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations on the night-flight ban in the event or the proposed construction of the northwest runway at Frankfurt airport would be carried out.
The authorization to land 17 aircraft between 23:00 and 5:00 a.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air pollution.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to appeal in cassation against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticizes this deadline and attempts to pressure the government representative to dismiss the appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal in Leipzig.
The leader of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which was to prohibit night flights. Otherwise, it will be conditioned as a total breach of a given word.
It is very difficult to be allowed to speak, said Green Leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's electoral slogan "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's criticism that the Land government is still trying to authorize night flights using "vocasserie and rublardises".
It takes time to conduct a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of its fraction's statements on the prohibition of night flights is completely flawed.
U.S. banks repay the aid granted
The large American banks, which are heavily affected by the crisis, are struggling with their links to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid 45 billion dollars (more than 30 billion Euros) to the Treasury, corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The U.S. television channel CNBC reported in a report that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions are thus seeking to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers and the payment of higher fees.
The Bank of Americaa launched an increase in capital through the sale of securities to investors, which brought him $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the amount comes from the bank's cash pools that are well filled by selling several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the Managing Director of the Bank of America, specifically thanked US taxpayers: capital injection helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by buying the Merrill Lynch investment bank at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to obtain money from the financial markets in order to free itself from the state's guardianship.
As of Thursday, the US bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase, reporting the CNBC channel citing the banking community.
The spokesperson for Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
By June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had benefited from.
Accelerated election
Finally, everything went faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current editor Nikolaus Brender by the board of directors of the German ZDF chain, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin editorial of ZDF, was the great favourite.
However, the chain did not want to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there has also been a willingness not to further harm the ZDF intendant Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors that Nikolaus Brender's contract should be extended by five years, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had expressed support for the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against. Brender's dismissal by vote represented a rather predictable and quaint failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority member of the Board of Directors, had already heard several weeks before the vote, did not want to return Brender to his position.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief by invoking the fact that the rate of listening to the ZDF's information broadcasts had fallen below Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, vigouring the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 experts in public law who had interfered with the debate and who felt that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But that won't do any good.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political sciences, pedagogy and roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked at Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national newspaper).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first in the news magazine "heute-journal" (present-day newspaper).
Then his career continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the assistant editor-in-chief of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazines" (bimonthly news program presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy department of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial office.
After Brender's disgrace, when he had just been elected a journalist of the year by the specialist magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the proposals of the intendant's staff could not be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political figures from the ZDF monitoring commissions.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor had skilfully handled the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to clear Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect it without being supposed to place a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic performances of the parties, Frey is classified liberal from the left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to show themselves more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and delegates of the Conference of Rectors, an agreement was drawn up stipulating that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of the exams: a single exam should allow the chosen study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload will need to be re-established to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed themselves to organising more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master courses.
At regional level, there must be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Less reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Ministers of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have constantly spoken in fashion: "studiability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The accreditation board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be completed by a single examination", can be read in a document of about thirty pages on the future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chair of the Accreditation Board states that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations one should be able to stop the slippages, which had a significant impact on studentability.
In addition, "studiability" should be, in future, the decisive criterion for the organization of studies.
Modules as well as the background should be carefully examined to see if you can avoid this feeling of choking that you sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge about Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and flexibility to allow and promote personal initiative".
The new regulation will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes were not too busy and the examination regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
The Rhineland-Palatinate has so far been the only Land to have given its agreement to provide more means for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities need to organize tutorial programmes and strengthen educational guidance offices as well as examination offices and the International Relations Service.
The Länder and universities are planning a budget of EUR 10 million for this.
In early 2010, the government wishes to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
As a result, only one examination will be required to complete his studies.
The organization of the studies should be more flexible, and recognition of the scores of other higher education institutions must be ensured and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studiability" of all university cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the issue of conditions of study in the country.
The decisions were appreciated but criticism was expressed.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said that he would like the organization of educational policy no longer to take place in the future "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as concerned persons should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful to us" she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each Bachelor's degree to register for a Master's degree.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder ensure that today's Bachelor students, that there will be enough places for Master's studies tomorrow and as good a level of study as possible.
The Länder must therefore hire more teachers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrived in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work of poet Werner Söllner, in which he themes in brimming of disturbing phrases, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and later director of collection in a publishing house for youth before settling in Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of Hesse's literature forum at the artist's house in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He did a lot of talking about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his fellow German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the political police Securitate.
In 1989 Söllner received the German language prize together with some of the participants.
The recruitment tests began insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner "so someone who has not been able to resist the intimidation tests of the Security".
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his exemplary literary distangles with the mechanisms of the power of dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and lowness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as can be said from the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own dossier Securitate, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
"He had been able to pull it out of all the difficult situations at the time," Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this public was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reservation for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of his own dossier.
It can be assumed that the victims have speculated and sometimes guessed which real names were last hiding the Sorin, Voicu and Walter loan names.
In contrast to Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
Systematic clarification has been constantly thwarted and impeded in past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work towards the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the return of the files has been rather long since.
Since 2005, there has been a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former leader of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disdainful manner towards the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and at the end of the day she had only been interviewed once.
The infamous power thought it could express itself here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many inescapable questions are associated with the Söllner case as it happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been robbed? The weighted reaction of the listeners, to the confession of Söllner, let hope that the continuation of this chapter will be more defined by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumults at the Champions League
It was felt that a representative arrived there, shot at four pins coming straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports articles manufacturer had spread his goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross climbed to midnight minus a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier to the hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, was allowed to drive to the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our five-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he had not drunk alcohol and he was also not drunk of happiness.
He had had a pleasant evening, but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
'Cause now it's about to start.
The words of Switzerland that had just been committed three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final", that is, in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back".
The "big job" is waiting for us on Sunday.
Here, it's about repeating to Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Draw by lot
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16./17. + 23./24 February/ match back 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn to the spell on 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of entering Babbel's successor's fulminant function was therefore moderate.
And joy was not only moderate in those who had brought luck, who had passed on to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and I told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I advised them to be braver, explained the "soul plumber" – Gross – the recipe of success that sounded so well but that no longer had effects with the healer Babbel.
He sparked a certain magic, admitted Jens Lehmann, a supporter of Babbel, "in football when there is a new impulse, sometimes things happen that would never have been thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "pro phenomenon" found by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "It is someone who moves on to action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet crossed course, warned manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs mainly tenacity.
Like Gross, the players and the manager are careful to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with the 0:4 , objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't gone through the hard way yet.
That Heldt on the day of his 40th birthday doesn't have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home win for three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann bounced back just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, against Heldt, in response to Lehmann's bitter criticism.
He accused the leadership of weak style and said that she had decided to change the coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the matches had been eliminated.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by a pure selfishness" underlie Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They no longer risked becoming friends for life these two quadragenaries.
In any cast, they agreed for everything else, that without the group's previous work by the replacement coach, the strong sport and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a large part in success" turned Heldt and Lehmann into choir – and even the man in the plastic bag acquiesced.
World Heavyweight Championship
Warm battle in Bern: Kevin Johnson, the challenger, constantly provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko verbally and gesturally.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title as world heavyweight champion according to the WBC Federation version.
At the unanimity of the judges, he was opposed to the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world heavyweight champion.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a one-off victory against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has defended his title with honour since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of World Champion of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he didn't get the KO so far.
Klitschko, who won 39 times in 41 professional battles, had to confess twice his defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson must have accepted his first defeat at the 24th battle.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mainly wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2.02 meters, on his left.
Johnson, eleven centimetres smaller, who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's blows, thus preventing Klitschko from making his counter-dangerous right come into play.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his blows only rarely touched the champion.
He is still the second fighter after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having crossed with Klitschko the distance from the twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the battle.
He insulted Klitschko treating him as "bad zombie" who "is not really capable".
On Friday, the champion couldn't help but provoke Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had at the time beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously abandoned without a fight.
This year, defending his title as champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a hit in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
Its harvest is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it was the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wore the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Haye had canceled a match against Vitali Klitschko which was scheduled to take place in September.
It would appear that his promotion company is considering playing this game now at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Green parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defense Guttenberg of lying in the case of Kunduz Affairs.
The SPD and La Gauche parties (day Linke) ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After examining the latest information on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition accused the Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a contradiction" on the murderous hit of two tankers last September, said the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the ARD chain news broadcast "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
In essence, this is the content of NATO's report, which was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the target of the attack was actually not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two major Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people had been killed or injured during the American air strike that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left prayed Saturday for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to speak promptly before the federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and her colleague from the Greens Party, Renate Künast, are of the opinion that Ms. Angela Merkel should make it clear whether the targeted slaughter strategy is part of the Afghan federal government's policy if the Chancery, the army and intelligence agencies have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
Chancery has in no way influenced the army's intervention in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were growing to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Ministry.
According to information from the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had provided to Guttenberg regarding the attack on tank trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some embarrassing details from the Minister.
In the vicinity of the two senior officials, however, it was suggested that they had informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a military police report.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would in the meantime have asked in a mail for clarification of the facts.
To date, no response has been received
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these allegations and referred them to the federal Parliament's commission of inquiry, which was to be formed on Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dream
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in psychic patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our darkened rooms, we can give ourselves unhindered to the craziest dreams and fantasies.
However, the one who, awakened, experiences the dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, has quickly the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in psychic patients or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes stimulates the limits between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A conscious awakening state, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, to the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect are distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitters of the brain - in the first place dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The Earth's force of attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakened; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
We're in the fall of 2001 when Henning T turns into a cartoon character.
Its body is in two dimensions in bright colours.
The Earth's attraction no longer has power over it, it glides to the ceiling.
He's feeling a blow.
Behind him creatures of winged devils, grinning, bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over the body.
Tonitruous voices, wicked, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of his stereo chain, making it a loop and attaching it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
It climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around the neck.
He's jumping.
The loop is detached.
Let it be a lesson to you, cry out the voices in a choir to tear out his eardrum. "Go to a clinic and get yourself treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, moreover it is manic-depressive, it takes medicines against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenic crisis, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitation, which causes them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the psychiatry department of the CHU of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That's why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience once in her life of hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
Delicious thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, alienation of the experience takes place in a real setting.
Why does our brain do that kind of cabrioles, it's always a puzzle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to lose momentarily the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals involved have severe brain damage.
It is assumed that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a mother's viral infection during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way the neural system abnormality occurs and the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a psychosis trigger, however there is a predisposition.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain warms up.
What is crazy, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychosis but also of an impressive number of many other pathologies.
Among them are mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, or head trauma.
It is surprising that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions, are hyperactive or not sufficiently refrigerated; when our brain warms up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimuli, stress, the sorrows of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants recognize having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklembourg-Pomerania, and she goes to high school.
A girl who's doing normal things to tell you.
If there were no images and voices.
During recreation, a young, thin, long-haired boy sometimes speaks to him.
When she answers her comrades look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunar dreamer but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's certain.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young friend.
Am I crazy? She asks sometimes.
But she knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
Often visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to take the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is clearly explaining equations in the table.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that comes too rarely and well too late, she often cannot make a distinction if she is awake or dreamt already, if the images she sees, the grumbling faces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she screams at those creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or friends, they'd think she was crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is today 20 years old.
She got her baccalaureate last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact with psychologist Kasten, she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Insanity is also an art work of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or has insufficient stimulation, the probability is high that they have hallucinations after a certain time.
I guess the brain's not busy enough, so there's animation.
Sarah K., the only girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was old enough to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain zones that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten "is taking place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness one unfortunately quickly tends to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but it also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience called onroid, a particular form of the change of consciousness awakened by the dream.
Oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The oniroid state of consciousness manifests during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with fully conscious polyradiculopathy experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of himself and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It's a state of mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is in fact an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, an organizational capacity that is given to us, to us men, not to sink into the void of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
Zurich's Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as an action to safeguard the soul.
He is 49 years old, at the time of his conscious journey for several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created from all quarters, visits from foreign places, travels over time. He sees himself as an old man in a railway sanatorium, a robot with his bedside guarding his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages among nobles who make blood-based narcotics.
He is abducted by a motorcycle Greek who takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
It completely absorbs itself in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally distinct from every dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes by describing what he has experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
One can even say that they are much more distinct and more intense than actual experience.
The intensity of this experience brings out the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, onroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of watch.
Any change in the state of consciousness, says psychologist Kasten, "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snows can fall
Thickness
At the age of 27, the children will take over from the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment as CEO of the Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he said to Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
Both children will inherit at 27 years of age and are firmly committed to integrating society, said 69-year-old Hubert Burda in Spiegel.
All details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will then arise.
It will also be necessary to see if they are capable of doing so.
We cannot impose our children on 7500 employees without knowing whether they have the capacity to deal with them.
This would demolish children as well as the business.
Burda had reported last Thursday that he was retiring from the post of President-Director-General as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
He then took care of the Treasury sector, i.e. he was responsible for the company's capital and after Jürgen Todenhöfer left, he also took the lead in marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus for the first time it is not a family member who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children were respectively 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's name is also used to link the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in the families that have been driven by a bulimia of capital, which have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
I never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I absolutely don't see myself as the country's preceptor as Springer could be, and I don't intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on much too much importance.
Integral Beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the objective of El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious signs such as Hedonai, laser wax specialist, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding ray, with in particular a tea salon, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you among other things to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation area in order to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax with a Jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms, where the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments are available.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touchscreen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to perform our exercise program properly.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching), are enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And, if after having made our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi sign has a room where we propose rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the slogans of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Miscellaneous décolletés
Christmas approaches and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we need to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, equip themselves with electric car
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, created the "LIVE Office".
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and will put in place mobility agreements, taking steps, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will get involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government as part of the MOVEL Plan to launch the installation of the electric car.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
Energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency, are among the latter.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa is involved in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a set of complementary projects, such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a future of tranquillity" for the motor sector
The President of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, saw "a future of tranquillity" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, was the country's main export sector.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of tranquillity for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integrated Plan for the Automotive Sector (IPA), has allocated EUR 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 ancillary companies, which have mobilised an investment of more than EUR 3,000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended for both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a "high increase" in registrations, which increased by "40%" in November.
20 000 m2 of vintage cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Motor Show, a meeting space for professionals and enthusiasts of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Cristal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only will motorcycles and motor vehicles be found there, but ClassicAuto Madrid will also find articles of any kind related to the world of the engine.
Thus, in the pavilion exhibitors, we will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, complements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make collectors and curious happy.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Classicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumberras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration, or Cochera Classicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Exterior aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this trade show will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Fitness tests with motor vehicles and motorcycles will also be carried out on a circuit outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop : A sustainable sport spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the spirit of sport is not angry with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine shutdown and start-up system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the gas 2.0 engine of 150 horsepower.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good score it has earned as a whole.
Details, vehicle finishing, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving station, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control board and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic style.
That's why we can say that as well Mazda3 as the Civic, both Japanese, contrasts with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to overcome.
By continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Add to all this a large chest with regular shapes.
The engine's automatic shutdown and start system, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-litre and 150-horse petrol engine with manual change of the six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its finesse, low noise, performance and control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not make a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is Sportive, i.e. the one with the largest number of serial elements.
Among the standard equipment, the track changer (VMR) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed controller, photosensitive interior mirror, large screen on-board computer, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
Moreover, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes, among other elements, bi-xenon adaptable headlights and a BOSE audio system with disk charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and their high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the gas 2.0 engine of 150 horsepower.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the model tested, the Sportive.
In return for this significant sum, Mazda3 will offer us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
Luxury "First"
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever dazzled us, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark "lady".
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows to look at his email, without offering the possibility to see some type of attachments or to browse the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see him on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, which is less than half of what costs, for example, the iPhone subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the The Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He's just as limited as his American grand brother, but he has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately look for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to view their mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it has long been expected to work.
Indeed, some operators have special arrangements and travel options, but as far as I'm concerned, I would need to have done a physics thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated reminders of the European Commission to propose affordable roaming rates throughout Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon while it does not have the Wifi) offers this type of rates, means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals allowing them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no galley.
This is a connected device and you pay when you buy it and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: an option to buy with access to life as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I simply hope so because I believe that this is a more just formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the favorite color of the first lady in the United States.
If she went to Barack Obama's position as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of that colour, she chose the same to accompany her in the second moment, without a doubt, the most important of her life: the surrender to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar pattern on these two occasions: besides their resembling colour, a yellow pulling towards the green with bright reflections, the two times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, jacket and coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So at first glance, it would appear that the first lady of the United States is following the trail of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to hand over the same outfits.
But the fabric in which both sets are cut makes them very different.
If for the takeover it was a thick lace, on the other hand, it was wearing a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium heel green shoes for the first time, and a similar but golden model this time.
The hairstyle also changed: the hair is now raised while wearing them off the previous time.
75% of working mothers had professional problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is reflected in the study "Women's fertility and career in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their career limited due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether the woman works or not, and the type of employment occupied.
Those who do not work outside the home, work part-time or work poorly, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, push back the entry into life as a couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after they have settled in a couple. This figure increases to 4.1 in those working in the public sector."These data show that women with stable employment have needed more time in their lives to obtain it, which has led them to push back the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment widely influenced maternity, but less the date of the beginning of common life," says CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those who studied elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another distinction also appears between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education get married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will embody the image of several brand products, entoning the universal motto "Because I'm worth it".
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities listed at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if selected were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
In men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
His greatest representatives, creators and models, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual award of their award, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best model of the year.
Manuel Vincent's Ace Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not do so according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The trip is exciting and Vincent spares neither the fearers nor the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to readings and readings.
I'll leave you here for a moment.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, that same one that I felt without naming it: pleasure against the fatal destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, devoid of meaning, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven through the path of perdition."
On James Joyce: "Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed on the north side, on which the best mountaineers are still and always taken."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner in the county and other times that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the cry of a bridge from this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he did so in the flight of himself and invoking posterity with a violent discourse to the asticots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she got on her knees and prayed: "Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: "Sleep after effort,/ after storm the port,/ rest after war,/ after life, tired of death rekindled."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she told her that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
One has never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent was beyond madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if he tried to hide Joyce from Baroja?
What's Benet trying to do if it's not to get Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did this do if it was not to aspire to the glory of this man to serve him as a pedestal?"
A cowardly assault
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a blood-male, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they gave her two feet that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we don't see what there is to be fun attacking a defenseless little animal that was also on the leash.
It is necessary to add to this the indignation of a woman who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an enerumene that attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., one Tuesday like another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been moaning all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint with the district police station even though we doubt that this is very useful and in order not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to make it clear that the killer cowards were Spanish.
Indignantness has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening in young people so that they find it fun to mistreat a defenseless animal free of charge that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, ensembles for the wearing of helmet
The Michelin tire manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among younger motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing helmets, since this is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which goes "beyond the design and manufacture of increasingly safe products" and stated that it contributes to this goal through other educational and informational actions.
This new two-wheeled helmet promotion campaign, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the widest dissemination of them.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly safe products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of the manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of the dealers.
However, the good news should be nuanced, since the comparison reference in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebound of last month, registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous fiscal year.
Since January, if all vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) have been added, 95,853 have been sold.
Large clouds that affect their demand the most have not dissipated. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in limiting bank loans, other factors such as the increase in unemployment or the persistence of poor economic conditions must be added.
In the face of this situation and the difference between passenger vehicles, the 2000E purchase aid has been little used.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre may also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) was reiterated.
The concessionaires' association foresees a year 2010 similar to that which ends, for which it calculates a fall in sales (tourism vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As with the ABS brake locking system and as with the ESP stability control, emergency braking systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of shortage has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even though, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many back shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the brake pressure in the event of an emergency detected by the system by the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, one third of the drivers involved in an accident could not press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken full advantage of its force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, revanced, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularisation of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four casualties would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to radar or camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps him by increasing pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize damage.
General Motors pushes Opel's plan back to January
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragossa) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that he will need more time to conclude Opel's rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, said that each point of the plan had been approved beforehand by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is ensured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian group Converg, is becoming important.
If there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to eliminate it from just less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to move from the automatic roof, which was replaced by a hand-held roof, to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors such as those of GT3, another 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilos of gains, to mount sports sticks, still 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, earning six more kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual clutch PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on roads in California's secondary mountain network, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
Weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it was a long time ago that we had not tested such a small and light model which, at the same time, guarantees so much safety in the turns, including at high speed.
He's a little athlete, able to heat his muscles at low speed for the necessary time, until we asked him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
It's out of what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or with a system that modifies the roaring of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either at the stop or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road surface we walked with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car handled the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants barely made a presence on the whole journey, while on some turns we found ice in the morning and gravel, later in the morning.
In short, an ultra-light car, the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.
"Battle Girl"
An intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, an icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the parades of the house, the singer displays her face as a bad girl with as much contenance as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or a "It Girl" is a "Battle Girl".
Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a brilliant triumph at 91-82 during its visit to Maccabi Electra's arduous field, despite the numerous absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic's team. It is thus at the head of his group, after Mirza Teletovic's grand show, which, with eight three-point baskets was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
Vitoria's team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large amount of commitment and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 three-point baskets marked, largely determines the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blues and reds, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, suggested that they had jumped on the Israeli ground with hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received by acclamations and applause back to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to notice that his team's best player, with 13 points scored, although the "less six" of Splitter's assessment already suggested that tonight was not going to be the best of Brazil.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from there, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria that they didn't win so easily on their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand," they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to ensuring that yellows take advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from dead, needed to chain up some skillful actions to get the air, and it was at that time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared which, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas gave the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and the locals succeeded in accentuating at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play the whole thing over the last period, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they would not let anyone take what they deserved for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support it from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped in Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to the Olympiacos and gave him the head of Euroligus Group B, in a match marked by the absence of Unicaja players, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion or by the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, made it possible to make the Andalusians dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, at the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the inner game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse the 22-20 score, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of battle, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to function by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury to the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults weighed on the Unicaja.
The indoor players and Lithuanian wingman Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the advantage 44-32 at the nineteenth minute.
An Impossible Rise
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympiacos, which, despite the 19 losses, showed itself superior and even matched the difference in the match at Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, making the group's head lucky.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis's support, left some hope with 66-57 at thirty-one minute.
But victory was virtually impossible because Olympiacos proved implacable when players pressed and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, to thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine having the largest number of small real estate ads, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The tool "How much should you be paid?" calculates the salaries of users from more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you have to register your profession, years of experience, age and city where you want to work.
Since the application has been running for a week, the search engine has found that, as a general rule, the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a press release the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovità from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer collects 45,226 euros per year and a French one, 31,059, while a Spanish one receives 24 000 euros.
Similarly, a driver earns 34,247 euros per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of server, with 11,592 euros net annual, followed by that of seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet over the past three months are those of drivers, mid-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown President will have to abandon the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official termination of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, Chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since 21 September, before that date.
"He realizes that he must leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he must seek another destination."
The channel also quoted the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is to leave as quickly as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the election of 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, as Zelaya refused the political exile condition of the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After pink days since last spring, during which the inflation of assets has been the dominant mark on the markets, uncertainty again arises, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt through direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at close to zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to be mobilised.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been almost completed and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, they are beginning to put some sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their auction at one year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and differences in corporate obligations are increasing again, although they remain far removed from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
There is once again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuges chosen by investors, causing an increase in differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's was threatened by a further revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the moral risk advocates, who were once again trying to raise awareness among those responsible for global economic policy who had impeded the destructive effects of limiting credit on the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the Emirs to restore its place to power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot with roses.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly unreasonable for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member country to fail to meet its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to transparency and makes its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of standardization of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, it would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our differences in public debt increase to the extent of the obligations of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European differences were to decrease and our differences continued to increase, then this would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery models and to revise upwards their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, who are back in charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not augur much hope for their warning.
Again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though "prudence is a mother of certainty at the moment".
Connected sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday, before the sub-committee of the Congress of Deputies, where the energy strategy of Spain is discussed these days for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán outlined for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommission, at eight-clos.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million euros until 2020 and 60 000 million more between that date and 2030, if the nuclear power plants currently in operation would remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the question changes, and the power will have to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal plants, with mechanisms for recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, he considers that an additional 18,000 MW are needed, along with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what its business demands, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "point-by-point" measures, as the President of Iberdrola described them.
In any event, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be made, because they take some time before they reach maturity and a stable remunerative framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market in ten airports
Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the leading partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaborative protocol yesterday to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance expects an investment of 20 million until 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to conduct energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Action contested its first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona fights for her first concession highway in Australia, a market in which she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The site at stake is an estimated tunnel of 1,700 million Australian dollars (approximately 1,047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are his rivals.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and highway dealer.
The town hall wants to be able to dispose of it by the end of 2014.
After choosing the public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their offers in May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (approximately 1,047 million euros) and in the last phase there are three consortia, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only smooth Spanish company, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European underground work specialists.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (affiliated by the German manufacturer Hochtief, who in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specialized in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatizations, but entering it is a major challenge, except through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just won a place in this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, Leighton's owner.
Millionary assets
It has been placed on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and directs the grouping of companies responsible for building and managing the Adelaide desalinizer, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the markets for infrastructure construction and management.
The underground toll track, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the said Northern Link (northern link), is called to connect the western Toowong Highway to the peripheral track in Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open to traffic by the end of 2014, it is not expected that the site will be completed by 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will comprise twice two tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide US$ 500 million (EUR 308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief a major success, which yesterday referred to a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local branch Leighton, the infrastructure of the national high-speed optical fibre network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have quick access to the Internet and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the 27-storey King George Tower construction project to Brisbane City. Work has not yet begun and Hochtief has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, is awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, amounting to EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having been entrusted with the work of widening the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start-up of the project is scheduled for early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Ms. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Ms. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that presented themselves to Renfe's tender, four of which were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A 63 million fine to France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programs on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company, has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it places on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recidivist.
A store of applications
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephony subsidiary followed the wake of other operators and opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
At first, Orange's app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will take until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has contributed 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, placing them in the third and fifth positions of clubs that have invested the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
In fact, the competition allocated EUR 5 362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third in the continent to get the most money for its participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams who also charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, though they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of distributing money applied by UEFA.
For this year, Michel Platini's lead organization plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification matches (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those arriving in the eighth final receive three million each, the eight teams arriving in the fourth final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça won 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are devoted.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four seats.
The previous year's champion takes 40% of the money spent, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid based on the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the stock purchase offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public offer of acquisition (OPA) for all securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this carry-over.
Yesterday, Sos' shares ended at 1.85 euros; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore evaluates the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of €1.50 reflects Sos' real assessment.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos' capital was 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos is continuing the restructuring of his management.
In an attempt to stay out of any offers of purchase and go and come judicially from its former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as internal audit director.
A decision that makes it the first woman to hold a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the supposed diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the next few months Sos reveals new misappropriations of funds cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the credit to Salazar, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina's exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (NCMV) yesterday authorised the exclusion OPA presented by Investera Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the current standards and that it considered "sufficient" the contents of the explanatory slip submitted, following the changes applied on December 2.
The CNMV specified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7,65 euros per share, representing 8,95 % of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilized and that they could not in any way be transferred before the finalisation of the offer, which he indicated had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, automobile garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and labour time can be a long and complex work.
The cost of repairing between EUR 20,000 and EUR 30,000 by hand, including parts and labour, may take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the most recent computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use such systems.
Service providers and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, then processing them and offering them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audadx, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
The other companies competing in the field of assessment tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audadx, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that over the past five years, more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard work, because each of the thousand pieces of the vehicle must be catalogued and its price recorded.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image of each model can be clicked on the different parts of a tourist car.
If it is a massively sold model, work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audadx has complete information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, for example, they have information about Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghinis.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the documentation and database development work, Audadex has eight centres worldwide (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (generally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audadx invests $90 million each year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information enables these companies to give them different uses and to offer various products.
The most common application is repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of the breakage parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadx does not propose it in our country, but it does so in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audadx, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased based on its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is €5.75, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to bid on wrecked vehicles.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geo-demographic analyses or know the current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious injuries for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of such tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of accidents, breakdowns or car maintenance.
The GT Assessment Guide is a historical market reference product.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, and in 2008 it reached a turnover of EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, she began her internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is made in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera Group (Audex, Sidexa, Informax ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, or 7.2 % more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the stock exchange for $1,000 million, and today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auctions of crash cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of damaged cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could extend next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of access to an immense international market.
This estimate and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, caskets and professional sellers who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and operates more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 vendors and 4000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Four-step garage quote
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audadex company ensures that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger cars, 109 all-terrain vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired is identified with its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the required part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, increases or discounts, then he can print the quote to give it to the customer.
AudaWorker is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated labour time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, Audadx is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
