The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The noticeable weakening of both parties in the big coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections in Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), in which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously changing, has suffered particularly severe losses.
On the contrary, the EU's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Kärnten Jörg Haider's deputy prime minister, is preparing for the triumphal return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the socio-democratic party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, compared to the last elections in 2006 but loses 5.5%.
Even worse it went to ÖVP, which loses with 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the Austrian post-war history and above all the literally catastrophic result of the popular, which caused early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP abandoned the coalition, the populars had a considerable advantage in their preferences before SPÖ.
But the voters obviously punished them because they caused the government to sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results there have been speculations about the possible resignation of the party president, Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
The observers believe that they could already take place on Monday during the extraordinary convening of the party's leadership.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path towards the ever more likely way out of the electoral outcome , i.e. towards the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition .
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) gained in advance 18% and the BZÖ 11% votes - but the socio-democrats simultaneously revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the people to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it separated from the BZÖ) that it was even the cause of sanctions by the Euopea Union.
On this evolution obviously plays Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and presumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to enter Parliament, but it has fallen slightly, falling among the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be cooled
If the problem could not be solved with the Czech scientists who were accused of the illegal collection of beetles in India, the Czech Foreign Minister, Karel Schwarzenberg, said that there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it were not to be resolved, then there would be some cooling," he observed after the meeting that took place under Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that executive power can hardly interfere with legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charge and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," the Minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison to resort to a higher instance.
Then you can ask for release on bail and wait for the sentence on release.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner spoke in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommends the appeal to the Major Court then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can get involved is by providing the convicted with the "competent legal support", the Indian Minister said.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being given by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been with India for many years.
The Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, in front of his partner he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
" We truly consider the imprisonment and accusation of these Czech scientists to be a profound mistake," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question if he had obtained a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I've got relatively many promises," he just noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 OSN Division workers for ocean issues and maritime rights.
His boss, the Czech Director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his presentation and sometimes adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides now a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other minerals, but also living organisms unknown so far that bring within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest bottom of the mainland
Coastal states have begun to give interest to the submarine territory.
According to the OSN Convention, they adopt the laws on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf which often extends up to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the state in question.
According to the Convention, this has an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In a few words, the continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often beyond 200 nautical miles," Mikulka explains.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the size of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a very broad technical and scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a preparation of many years.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The Commission has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees were successful," Mikulka adds.
The recent success of Australia, which has greatly expanded its marine possessions, has recorded a worldwide echo.
But also New Zealand has earned us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, about 1.6 square kilometers so more or less six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will grow in the future from the seabed, as they are promised, will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since the Montego Bay Convention has been ratified.
There where the continental shelf ends begins the zone of the bottom of the ocean that the Convention has declared a common heritage of humanity."
No one has an exclusive position here anymore.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Marine Base is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, exaggerating, "with the fact that its individual parties are legally demarcated and their contractually established regime."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
If it breaks it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 according to the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, the status of so-called pioneer investor.
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and little larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is broken, it's an almost underwater replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on the total surface of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a deposit rich in polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the Macedonia division Rober Sandev brings with him a find to show him.
It looks like a small potato or with a bit of fantasy, a legendary schem, as in the legend of the wake of the Golem.
German special units were present at the liberation of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
On the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages, more and more detailed information comes to us.
On the rescue operation as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, special German units participated.
In addition to the army specialists, the GSG9 units were present, the Federal Air Police, the Federal Criminal Office and the logistics experts of the technical institution.
As the spokesman for the ministries announced on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get there luckily," says a spokesman for the interior ministry.
Aggressors kidnapped on September 19 in southern Egypt a group of travelers: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end has remained secret as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The freed in the meantime have arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the hostages released are under the protection of the German embassy.
It did not explain the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin until they returned to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and special units should fly with an Airbus of the military aircraft and arrive Tuesday in Germany.
The American representative chamber rejects the rescue package.
The first room of the American Congress just failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 voices about 227 the American representative house rejected the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of American President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both sides, there had not been a majority for the program, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been undermined.
In a dramatic action, supporters have desperately tried to persuade critics of the heavy 700 billion dollar package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, urged the Members to consent, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived.
While the vote was in progress, the Dow Jones fell more than 6% or 600 points.
The reason for investors' concerns was that the state bailout package could have failed.
It resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect other serious turbulence on the international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force, it is necessary that it has the benefit of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters record figures in increase of bookings
Looks like it's gonna be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to one study, the turnover on travel bookings for the coming months compared to the previous year has clearly increased - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak views of conjuncture the desire to travel of Germans as a result of an investigation remains firm.
On the winter season bookings, travel agencies recorded an increase in turnover of 31 % compared to the same period of the previous year , as the German association for tourism DRV announced in Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK market research institute there are increased booking quotas already for the autumn months.
So the excess of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would be about 11%, the DRV reported.
Subject to these results are the figures of the GfK, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the whole market.
Also included would be travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar quotation, requested in particular would be travel to the United States, reported the DRV.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
It would also be particularly important to travel to the German countries, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as to Germany.
Above all, all inclusive travel has a high rating, explained DRV president Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculated for customers than for an individually organised holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for bookings made in advance or offers with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the year before there would be again a surplus of turnover - even if according to a further study the number of Germans who took a trip, compared to the previous year has dropped.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann's Hits, one-litre bottled beer and vip in Dirndln.
A debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, television moderator and wears a custom-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, joins us: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, the photographers are already throwing themselves at us and taking pictures until they fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this at my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how friends do it.
The two-dollar Dirndl seems to achieve its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist and actually residing north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress until today remains within limits.
And instead, once you get to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl apron collects strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A nun pointed out to me that I would tie the apron wrongly: "On the left you are free, on the center you are virgin, on the right you are busy, behind the widow."
I'll pull my bow from the back to the left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of thin flirt techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which they cape "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch the bare back against an uninvited one.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is named Bob, comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a "ooooooo" cliff.
This tells me, after he got rid of his beer jar from a liter drunk before.
Right next to one of these hydrants, which everyone thinks is a pattumier.
Bob is one of these famous "Wildbiesler".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about 8 p.m., the health workers walk in the piazzale of the feast, who have to take care of the poor beons.
The nurses appear every time in a blank – always 4 at a time they drag a curtain covered with tent in a tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: you go empty, you come back full.
Whoever lies under the curtain in this bar of alcohol in the blood, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer pack", one of the healthists yells at me and disappears in the baraonda.
Victims of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died shortly afterwards.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on charges of careless driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is widening diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, the European powers were anxious to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, is one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha Train Station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the tour guides tell you.
The building is riding between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the ceiling at a time, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the most Western passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railway running to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed
British and dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station too.
In 1917 a train of ammunition broke out destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then he has slowly gone into disfavour, largely overcome by history.
But today, this rail outlet for Anatolia and all the points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's increasingly large diplomatic horizons.
The ruling party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created an entire new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
Significantly, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the wagon bed for Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main foreign policy experts of AKP, Turkish deputy Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a run of bumps along the slopes that produced the old world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspects in the West, more notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, a state-of-the-art structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-sized shopping centers built and power pastry shops, where managers in business - both men and women - meet to make contracts early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
Cold war was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today you have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't one or the other.
They must be both.
"But surely at some point, "I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want where to face that choice."
Then he points out a point that almost everyone I spoke with here has recited in memory: the ties of not only the Middle East, but also the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as much as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically travel those railway lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at Hydarpasha Station, after another white night, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had watched this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions can now be, to a large extent, in the hands of Turkey.
And while I wait for the ferry terminal that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
Then at least there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent to advance pretenses on this fascinating country.
Quick Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, September 11) had been in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under-21, but at the time the Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty years old - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face all that music presented to do, both madrigal and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and enthusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let music speak for itself".
He said: "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there in music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial or flowered.
Whatever the musical standard, it made him ever higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a knight, an orchestra director would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I have covered more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors who, in his words, simply "walked around the world one or two well-known battle horses".
So many of us will be missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrology by William Woodruff (25 September) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... while studying for a degree in science, one in letters and one in PhD".
This follows from Woodruff's memo in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a university professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, at which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"Recommending the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They drew my attention to the simplicity and strength they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda's supersales
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with large housing, this new monovolume has an even larger interior space.
A refined mechanics must be added to everything, which increases driving comfort and saves fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before proceeding to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after the entry into the market of the first generation.
Therefore, one first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other producers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, almost a million Jazz units have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As far as the new generation is concerned, those responsible for the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell around 2,000 Jazz units over a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the drop in sales in Spain to a good extent.
In fact, the company's managers plan to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, that is 4,000 less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
In addition, Japanese society expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To succeed, Honda trusts the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a hybrid with five doors and compact format - 4.37 meters long - of which Japanese society hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year all over the world.
For the markets and according to the estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the company presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz grew in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimetres more), the width is 1.69 meters (two centimetres more) and the entire length is 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimetres.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the living room is also expanded.
This advantage derives from the insertion of a new platform, and from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the baggage capacity – with double background – is 399 liters, i.e. 19 litres more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of engine version 1.4, and that the luggage capacity of Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also, the engines in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with 1.2 and 1.4 liters petrol engine.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows you to lower consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize mechanics and at the same time keeps the engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2 liter model allows you to enjoy a power of 90 cv at 6,000 laps with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 laps.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses – uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, now 100 are available.
Jazz 1.4 at 100 horsepower reaches a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "bea car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
Japanese society has created a robot that, for example, takes the flight of bees, can avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of the Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, BR23C is an expansion of the Security Shield of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in vehicles in the manufacturer's home.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to Nissan's security shield.
But the most important thing is the composite eyes of bees, able to see in all directions with an angle of more than 300 degrees, and that allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual feature, engineers have developed what they have defined as a localization laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C for a radius within two metres and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor on board that immediately prevents collision.
"When it detects an obstacle, the little robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at the right or greater angle to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and engineer head of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot divert upwards or downwards, not even diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and in the direction in which it can rotate its wheels and not exploit infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and to act on this data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of anticipated maneuvers, so it can work without interruptions and with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, not even mega."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be serial in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the typology with lithium ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to destination avoiding obstacles in the path.
Trema before applying for a loan
We must recognize that the United States Treasury Department, as well as having many capitals to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and in order to prevent Americans from engaging in garbage loans in dubious insolvency banks, they have created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the Hotel of Bad Credits... or problems.
The ceiling aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce thinking not one, but two or even three times before applying for a loan.
And, above all, where to do so, which is probably the primary objective.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but is not detailed.
It is more a page for teenagers than a site for the vast public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a dream room in the hotel.
It's still something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest $9 billion in a share equal to 21% of the company's share, news received following a sharp decline in its stock stock in Stock Exchange.
One week after the drafting of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that the MUFG would have bought 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's equity at the individual cost of $25.25, or a sum of $3 billion.
The established price is 19% lower than the book value of securities as at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global transaction would take place on the basis of an average price of $29, or a lower percentage than its current rate of 28%.
By 17.00, however, the Morgan Stanley title fell from $6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding company," explained John Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow her to differentiate her actions by however passing them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than previously assumed.
The manners defined on Monday also show that in the last days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese colossus for a sum of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno , executive director of the MUFG, explained: "We thought our share of participation would be exclusively composed of ordinary shares.
But considering the current world economy and market situation, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, the MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis."
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in one year if, over a given period, the latter are traded more than 50% below the conversion price fixed, i.e. at around $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by the MUFG would allow her to seize investment opportunities, strengthen her budget and increase her liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, refused to provide clarification on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier One solvency coefficient of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan specified that it had "clearly" eased its budget from the end of August.
The last few weeks have put the group to the test, which has seen half the value of its shares halved while the cost of risk insurance has been pushed.
The cost of the Monday, however, remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week the Goldman Sachs, the only other "superstit" among the big investment banks on Wall Street after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the detection of Merrill Lynch, announced that he had raised $15 billion, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
To base the republic on a socialism right in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales et dell'Ecuadoriano Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, the latter gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, on a vote of 80%.
According to these results, "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white cards.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of the electoral seats and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced an overwhelming victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had, moreover, claimed in the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed gloriously", he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians in the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers south-west of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place in complete calm according to the electoral observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points aimed at consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the President.
This draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "planning of development" of a country that lives essentially from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
Designed by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives greater power to the Head of State, who can be elected for two consecutive terms of four years, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to propose its candidature for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also affirms the free provision of health and education services, which the President has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held prisoners in the desert for ten days were brought back on Monday afternoon, safe and sound, to the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, around 15:30, on board a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to issue any interviews to the press, to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and have not been paid any ransom "to the kidnappers", said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the runway.
Kidnapped on 19 September during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been bombarded from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five German and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous, the organizing agency of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night, just before dawn.
"There were gunshots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled," said the official who requested to maintain the anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lampo" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian foreign minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of secret agents and Italian special forces.
We must admit that if we have achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, the special forces," he said, without adding any further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol force claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which the kidnappers were on and killed six, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and to have captured two.
According to the army, the kidnappers would be linked to an organization of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a statement immediately denied by the latter.
Letter- The silent majority of culture
On the front page, a debate on the financing of culture focused on the current election campaign.
All the better.
But part of our cultural life remains in the shadows.
Who will decide to denounce the poor sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic places that hunger?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that he is neglecting monuments and capital buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government pays three and a half million euros for the only restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
At our American neighbours, it is the Constitution that affirms that heritage protection is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all this by common accord.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouped in 211 societies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archives and heritage assets, preserve, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states help through partial nationalisation the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which ended up in difficulty for the first time in Europe for the crisis of the American credit market: the three nations will provide 11.2 billion euros to the financial institution - insurance with interests also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands at the weekend agreed at the highest level, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been under discussion for more than a year is that of Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can be a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the share of the bank present in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the actions of Fortis had begun with a vertical collapse, serious signs of crisis of the institute had appeared then in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to fail.
The bank's shares on Friday fell by almost 12%, the lowest point for 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Considering the current stock prices the entire capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank's managers this value is not real.
The company summit imputes the collapse of the Fortis shares to the uncertainties of the extra-European market due to the acceptance of the US plan of $700 billion.
Monday the title slowly resumed to rise.
On Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed new managing director of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has presented itself with a worthy offer.
The Belgian government had already previously ensured that investors should not fear losing money.
The bank's clients did not panic, the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also purchased leasing companies.
The fox in the cock
In America, life and health insurers, based on people's medical purchase data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription drug data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the poultry to the fox" - writes the Washington Post citing Richard Dick the author of the program to follow the prescriptions of medicines.
Insurance companies shall subordinate the insurance rate and the amount to be paid in the event of health claims by the prospective customer and if they consider the risk too high they shall not specify the insurance.
A long time ago, the client had to undergo a medical visit and the contract was concluded only after the examination had taken place.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: according to the customer's identification code you can easily have information from the pharmacies on which medicines he bought in the last year and a half and hence the evince program of which diseases he suffers and in which health conditions he is in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in your blood is infrequently high and is classified as the highest risk category.
There are several versions of the program on the market, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer in addition to paper work does not remain much, even if there are small difficulties.
In contrast, some medicines can be used for several purposes, e.g. some compounds can be used against migraine or heat flushes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the insurance - commercial point of view, is the risk factor, the first two nos.
For the request and processing of data, separate companies have been formed, and before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, they ask for the patient's approval.
Now the authorities are forcing them to do so even though they have so far not done much for negligence.
Some companies have also recently developed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to medical consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data and at the same time control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a bill that gives control powers to companies specialized in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that links the other data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise insurers do not enter into the contract.
Then in the end the chickens are entrusted to the leniency of the fox.
Global Marseille menu
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are mainly trading partners, the agenda for the ninth summit meeting was also dominated by this issue, in addition to all other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit which will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is becoming a great democratic power to which more voice should be given in international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So he did not insist on this issue in the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseilles.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso as Chairman of the Committee and Javier Solana as High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found the agreement to double in five years, that is to say increase up to 100 billion euros, trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods has risen from 25 to 55 billion, this is not too ambitious a goal.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so air traffic can also take the lead in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth largest trading partner in the EU.
The summit devoted attention to global issues.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms from both sides, and urged the convening of a UN conference.
They called for the conclusion of the Doha Round, although both sides had a role to play in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that the energy and climate programme will continue, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need to conclude a global pact at next year's climate conference and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the increase in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister will visit the French capital where a bilateral meeting is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris it is hoped that to build the Indian nuclear reactors the French companies will receive a commitment worth 20 billion euros.
According to information from our press agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt over three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
There will be over three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The International Book Fair in Frankfurt awaits for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
He will be the Undersecretary to the Ministry for Goods and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be present institutionally with an Italian Point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
He will follow the press meeting at Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign author's books gradually decreases on the total of Italian production, and in particular on that of adults and young people.
Found Steve Fossett's plane missing billionaire a year ago
The wreck of Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying into the Nevada desert.
The wreckage was found at an altitude of 3000 metres, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Within the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, has escaped the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore specified that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was killed in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the sighting of the wreck was sent a team of investigators, who then identified the aircraft: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal belongings of Fossett had been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's research had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world round on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had flown around the world without a stopover.
Among its many records, also that of flying at 15,445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemes with an original design and well defined by decided lines, large surfaces and clear corners.
This is, in short, Glk the last born among the "compact" offroads of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Just for its content out of the traditional canons, it will be unexpected and not conventional also the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the showrooms Mercedes-Benz from 17 October.
Thus the advertising beatage that will accompany the debut of the new car will start an unprecedented mode of communication also through an adventurous 3D auction campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A maxi-affission project, organized in three different phases, which will dominate the very central street of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car comes out of the manifesto.
Later, by using the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, and then recommenced into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new into the stereotyped field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to stifle the interest of future buyers? We will see.
That's who the Italian hooligans are.
From the Trivenet, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Azzurra National for years and that so far, for the truth, had never created excessive problems.
He'd never even clashed with the opposing fans.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The promoters come from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added groups (a few units, in fact) from Campania and Apulia.
They have tricolor flags where the towns of origin of the militants appear: Saturday evening they were removed for not being identified.
They are inspired by the English typhoseria.
In Bulgaria they found a typhose of real Nazis, that of Levski.
Figc had made 144 tickets for the match available to Italian fans: all names, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had in fact controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a history of stadium crimes, had been refused the ticket and prevented the transfer.
Now the Viminale waits to read the acts that will arrive from the Bulgarian police then will take action: in this case, you can give the Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only Italian stadiums but from all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Luckily.
But now there is fear-emulation: that is, that to those little more than one hundred and fifty, others are added.
"We must immediately turn this fire off and not legitimize those who behave like this," they claim from the Viminal.
So, "well-open eyes especially in view of the National game on Wednesday in Lecce."
In Puglia in fact there is a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is secret services, which deals with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and arm stretched during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks director of the Observatory of the Viminale (he took the place that was first of Francesco Taggliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been a Quaestor of Trieste where there is a nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to deny the Duke but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I don't do the sociologist - adds the No.1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country where the fact takes place.
So far this group has remained in line, now we will see what has happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about Mameli's hymn whistles: even those are not criminal, but if you'll allow me, they're not education...".
