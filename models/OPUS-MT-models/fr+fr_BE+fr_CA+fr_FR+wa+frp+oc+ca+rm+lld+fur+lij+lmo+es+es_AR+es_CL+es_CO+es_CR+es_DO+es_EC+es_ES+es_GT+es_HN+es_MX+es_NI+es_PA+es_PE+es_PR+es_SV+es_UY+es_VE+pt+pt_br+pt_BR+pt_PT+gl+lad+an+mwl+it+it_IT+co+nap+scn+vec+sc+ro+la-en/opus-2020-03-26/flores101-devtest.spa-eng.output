In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were plumbers, an already generalized theory, also offers specific data that fossils usually do not offer, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to specialists, this animal has a brown plumage in the upper area and a pale tonality or carotenoid in the lower part.
The finding also allows for a better understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the plumage of dinosaurs does not have a well developed axis, called raquis, but does have other features of the feathers (cerdas and barbulas), the researchers concluded that raquis is likely to be the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure that presents the plumage suggests that its function was not related to the flight, but used it to regulate the temperature or as an indicator of it. Researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' assessments were that, even when it comes to the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

In France, the elections have traditionally been an untechnological experience: voters isolate themselves in a cubicle and insert in an envelope a pre-commitment sheet indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials corroborate the identity of the person who submits to vote, he enters the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law establishes the procedures in a fairly strict manner.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have to be transparent, allowing voters and observers to verify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no others other than those of those who vote, duly computed and authorized, are added.
Candidates have the power to send representatives to control each stage of the process and, at night, volunteers compute votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

By being compared through the use of infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), it could be determined that the composition of the crystals coincides with that found in the urine of the affected pets.
I do not know whether they have been aware of this or not, but most of the products coming from Central America came to this country tax-free.
Even so, the Central American countries taxed 80 percent of the products we produced. We treated them to you.
It seemed to me that that didn't make any sense; it definitely wasn't fair.
All I'm saying to people is that you treat us just like we treat you.
A bill was issued by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who does not allow the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill provides that violent video games that are sold in the state of California must be labeled with a slander with the legend "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1,000 for non-compliance.
The Director of the Attorney General's Office, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning reporting that Huhne and Pryce would be brought to trial.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. Norman Lamb MP is expected to assume the position of business minister that Davey leaves vacant.
On 16 February, Huhne and Pryce were scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, aged 25 and 21, respectively, passed away.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to the arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider needed facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon was stuck as he pointed towards the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, does not see with one of his eyes, lacks a part of his skull and his face must have been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified through a virtual link from a U.S. Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual championship races apart from Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he obtained a "No End of the first race", as did 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In his other career, the giant slalon, obtained the tenth place in the women's group of seats with a combined execution time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes below the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, of Hungary.
Four skiers in the seated category failed to complete their races and a total of 45 participants from 117 of the Giant Slalom did not reach the race classification.
Madhya Pradesh's police force was able to recover the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are charged.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house at the time of the impact of the car, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed as the emergency services pulled the red Audi TT driver out of their interior.
He was initially transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adeloya has been in Edinburgh County Court, charged with the murder of her son.
While she is in custody pending prosecution and trial, any statement of an eyewitness may be questionable, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in other regions of the United Kingdom, but since Scottish justice works otherwise, the courts considered the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University said: "It seems that journalists walk on dangerous terrain when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of prosecutions, advised journalists that no additional comments would be made at least until the indictment was issued.
According to the leaked information, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve on the basis of the limits in force prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were also addressed, as reported, include the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
During the complementary pest control test, the rangers had to closely monitor the shooters, as they were monitored and evaluated for their effectiveness.
In a union between NPWS and the Association of Sports Shooters of Australia (NSW) Inc., suitable volunteers were recruited into the hunting program of the Association of Sports Shooters.
Mick O'Flynn, who is temporarily in charge of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage Office, noted that comprehensive safety and training was provided to the four shooters selected for the shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore to a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
In four years, it's Martelly's fifth CEP.
Last month, a presidential commission advised that the previous CEP should resign, in the framework of a series of measures that seek to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way Martelly responded to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, sometimes violent, were provoked by the fact that no elections have been held, in some cases since 2011.
Approximately 60 iPod cases have been reported with problems of operation and excessive heating, resulting in six fires and causing burns of less than four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Commerce and Industry of Japan (METI) reported 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company listed as "non-serious".
The ministry spoke about the delay in Apple's report, saying it was something "truly regrettable."
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 a.m. GMT) on Friday.
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Agency indicated that there was no record of damage in the national territory.
The Pacific Tsunamis Alert Centre also reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer in that country abducted a bus and kept tourists from Hong Kong captive.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, photographers took the place of an old woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was cremated.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began studying medicine.
He received training in obstetrics and joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature delivery in his free time while working in the hospital.
His study showed that the fetal lung maturation of the baby could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators managed to recover flight recorders from the black box.
Luna's fellow fighters also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman".
Dustin Gold in Polvo Runnels stated: "The moon was as rare as me; even more. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she is in a better place".
Since 2008, among the 1,400 respondents in advance of the 2010 federal elections, there has been an 8% increase in those who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, Acting Prime Minister, argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic once Queen Elizabeth II's term of office was completed.
34% of respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last queen in Australia.
At one end of the survey, 29% of people believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other, 31% believe that it should never do so.
The Olympic winner of the gold medal had to swim in the free style of 100 meters and 200 meters, and in three highlights in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been put in doubt as a result of his complaints.
It has not been possible to take medicines to relieve pain, because it is forbidden to use in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known.
Many people checked the finding by using various types of hardware and software and at the beginning of February and released on Tuesday.
Possibly, comets have served as a source of water supply to our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists' expectation is to understand how planets originate, in particular ours, since comets crashed on Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a bill that allows people of equal sex to marry.
He called it "political talk and nonsense" to rumors.
It is speculated that it will be presented to the presidential elections in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances from air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It employs satellite technology, in contrast to the old ground radar technology, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate data to pilots.
No additional transport will be implemented and trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parking and dissuasion will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, the possibility of the game being held in closed doors without the fans of the team was considered.
On Thursday, Science magazine released an investigation that reported the appearance of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden reported that the new species was able to evolve in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, due to the reproduction between an endemic Darwin pint, strong Geospiza, and a migratory cactus pint, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take all kinds of forms and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into foils, but it is also possible to stretch it until a very thin wire can be twisted and braided.
It can become very thin and adhere to another metal. It is such the thinness that can be achieved that it is used to decorate the illustrations made by hand in books called "lit manuscripts".
This is called pH of a chemical. You can produce a pH indicator using red collar juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H at pH) present in the chemical analysed determines their pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of disposing of a proton from its electron.
Shake both dry powders together and, after doing so, with your hands hygienically and moistly, spread them out to form a ball.
There will be a reaction between moisture in your hands and its outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with discharge in almost all the houses, which connected with a sophisticated drainage system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, public toilets had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When you communicate with someone who's thousands of miles away, you're making use of a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent to space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, since the light of the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light and view we have.
A giant rocket, over 100 feet high, is required to carry a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most relevant thing it has done for us was to provide us with a much simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to it today we have many means of transport, such as railway or car, among many others.
Below, there are more moderate-sized cats that feed on medium prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (which include independent domestic cats) that feed on small species that exist in much more quantity, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each feline has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most socialized felines and their lives take place within large groups called herds.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, united with up to thirty females and their offspring.
Females usually relate closely to each other, making them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds have the same behavior as wolves or dogs, with whom they have a surprising similarity (as opposed to the other big cats) both in their conduct and in which they are highly lethal to their prey.
Integral athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not too well), swim, make extensive jumps and pull five times stronger than a robust person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as the lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four cats able to emit rusty.
The one of the tiger is not a fully sounding roar like the one of the lion, but rather as a prayer of words spoken to grunts and screams.
The oceans enjoy feeding on small creatures. As far as possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all their preys will be much smaller than their own.
Scientists believe that the oceans track and find animals to eat (takes) through the smell, smelling the soil where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places and, in addition, they move very quietly. The ocelots hunt their prey by mingling with their surroundings and then swing over them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) departs from the main one they come from (for example, if they move to a mountain chain or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily retreat) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they used to be used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it had before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still need the same adaptations as in the past.
As time passes, as the incipient population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to catalogue them as of the same species.
This process receives the name of speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inescapable consequence and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (that they fire).
The plants' food is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from the plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Musosaurus was the alpha predator of his time, so he was afraid of nothing, except others of his own kind.
His long jaws had embedded more than 70 sharp teeth like razors, in addition to another additional group in the palate, which translates into that anything that happened to him in front of him, had no escape.
We don't have security, but he could have had viperin. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurus and, even, it could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a dinosaur as huge as the T. Rex was a threat to him.
While most of that food would be quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate some unconventional items at banquets, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails and even a kind of rodent, the loron.
Another thing they differed in was that humble people and women ate sitting in a chair, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and throwing themselves away while they ate.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included food that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a central temple considered their home.
The people carried sacrifices for the gods and the priests sought to satisfy the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
Special towers with pyramidal shape, called zigurats, were sometimes built to form part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the midst of the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was no more important.
The Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just counters that gave to the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was extremely expensive.
Very few inhabitants lived in Greenland. According to the Nordic sagas, Erik el Rojo was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that he undertook more westward, discovered the island and gave him his name.
Even so, without prejudice to their discovery, the Eskimo tribes already inhabited the place by then.
While each country separately was 'Scandinavian', there were marked differences in relation to the people, monarchs, habits and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you may believe that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. While the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has in its reverse the phrase "Declaration of Original Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, face down.
Although it is unknown to certain science who wrote it, it is known that it was barely made, the huge scroll document (measure 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up to be saved.
Therefore, the annotation is likely to have been added only as a label.
While the landings carried out during D-Day, as well as subsequent clashes, had achieved the liberation of northern France, the southern side still remained.
His government was in the hands of the French "Vichy", who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the so-called "Operation Dragon" was deployed, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In just two weeks, the American forces and those of Free France had achieved liberation from southern France and were still on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of which a large group of people living and working together are part; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilization, which means civil, and relates both to the word civil, of the same language, which means citizen, as with citizens, whose meaning is city or city state and which, in addition, determines in some way the size of society.
The state cities are the forerunners of nations. A culture of civilization involves a long generational transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy and homogeneous propagation.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and fail to be recognized as civilizations themselves.
During the Revolution War, the thirteen states formed, at first, a central government indebted under the Articles of the Confederation, in which the congress was its only component.
The Congress had no powers to set taxes and, given that it had a national executive or judicial power, that function was the responsibility of state authorities, which often did not cooperate to enforce all their laws.
Nor was he empowered to annul tax laws or interstate tariffs.
The articles called for the unanimous approval of all states to proceed with their amendment, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives used to be absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the selected team from Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and skate racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
In Japan there are about 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the globe.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands it contains, Japan is often referred to as a 'archipelago' from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when the sailors of Europe who sailed the place recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, that is, beautiful island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, based in southwestern Taiwan, began a transformation into the Aboriginal grain production method, with the use of Chinese labor to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
The army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared it a province dependent on the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War, (1894-1895), Qing's government acceded to the Shimonoseki treaty, through which Taiwan's sovereignty was transferred to Japan, which retained its control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three capital buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been rebuilt at the end of the complex in order to allow tourists to visualize how they originally worked.
By 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had already been restored and the work continues today.
To illustrate, the most common fixed image format at the global level is 35 mm, which was the most used film size towards the end of the analogue film era.
Today it continues to occur, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship was transferred to the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Indeed, the size of 35 mm is somewhat confusing, as its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore it is said that the dimensional ratio of this format (dividing by twelve in order to calculate the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many typical formats (verbigracia, the group of APS formats) are the same or very similar to this aspectal relationship.
The rule of the thirds, which has been the subject of constant mockery and often ridiculed, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while allowing to give some order to the images.
It indicates that the most effective position where to place the central object is the intersection that forms between horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of Europe's history, the Catholic church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For over a millennium, Christianity had managed to unite the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the pleb.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are reserved for that specific function.
The church's central dome had remained in Rome for over a millennium and this concentration of power and money caused many to wonder if this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the hostilities broke out, the British began a naval blockade on Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, this measure violated widely recognized international law and was contemplated in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain extracted international waters from the entire ocean to block the entry of ships, even putting neutral vessels at risk.
Having received a reduced response against this tactic, Germany thought it would encounter a similar reaction to its unbridled underwater war.
Throughout the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, countries wanted to prevent that situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the U.S. in order to take a job at Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents, a book of poems and a recommendation note made by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each stage or every family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with divided provinces. The best known was that of the Three Kingdoms, which developed over 60 years, between the Hhan Dynasty and Jin.
During these stages, a cruel war broke out among many nobles who disputed the throne.
One of the most bloody periods in ancient China's history was that of the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many its political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to one sovereign.
Also, after the Revolution, the positions were open to all male candidates, allowing the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same is true of the military, since instead of basing military positions in class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people in the repressed working class in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which persisted in time, realistically illustrates Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
On the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, lies a totally abstract cave on the rest of the planet.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one was certain of his existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen more than the wonderful clear sky and the many mountains around it. From the inside of this cave, you can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that remains standing is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, raised by the Egyptian people in the third century B.C., is one of so many pyramidal and large structures built to venerate the deceased Pharaoh.
The Meseta de Guiza, or "Necropolis de Guiza", in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this type, tombs and smaller temples rose in honor of their wives and family.
The "arc upwards" mark resembles a V and the "arc downwards" mark is similar to a staple or square without its lower edge.
Upstairs means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down it means you should start at the frog, where your hand holds the bow, and throw it away.
The ascending movement of the bow generates a softer sound, while a descendant is stronger and sharper.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on the bow instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women in the market forced the terrified monarch Louis XVI, Maria Antonieta, her two young children (Maria Teresa, eleven years old and Luis Carlos, four years old) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to fully open the windows of his carriage.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a royal guard executed in Versailles in front of the queen, who was panicking.
The Philippine people themselves paid the war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime in order to pay most of the expenses and interests of the bonds that fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
From now on, the super gains derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of order.
The European historical period in which these events take place is usually known as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (i.e. between 1000 and 1300 d.C.).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends about 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that understands, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense that there is an underlying logic that drives the destiny of humanity and that relates to the laws of science and how they are shaped in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development itself is unfolded by an independent path of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has "effects" in societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one might argue that the existence of cars necessarily derives from the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a reduced volume of cars, and new manufacturing techniques are being designed to reduce the cost of owning a vehicle.
Massive car use also generates a greater impact on traffic accidents, leading to the development of new health techniques to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars such as Goether, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography developed that, in harmony with the localization of that society, were preferable to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was regarded as such in feudal Europe.
His fame of being an epicenter of luxury began at approximately 400 B.C. and extended to approximately 1100 B.C.
During the 12th century his status fell, mainly because, upon his return, the Crusaders brought gifts, such as silks and spices, to which they were given greater value than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "fashion capital" was then transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The dome of Gothic style took place in the period between the X-XI and the XIV centuries.
At first, the way of dress was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, Western styles could lead to a delay of about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, the product of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their garments.
Subsistence farming is defined as the one whose objective is to produce sufficient food to meet exclusively the needs of the farmer and his family group.
subsistence farming is a simple, generally organic practice that combines the use of stored seeds originating in the ecological region with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, much of the main activity of farmers was subsistence agriculture, which is still practised in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by social standards and give them the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender from its members.
The features that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or religious or political related, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to display features of their belonging to the subculture by resorting to the distinctive and symbolic use of style, such as fashions, gestures and jargon.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms to graph the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are referred to as "savages". Some wild children are confined by persons, in general their parents. In some cases, abandonment of a child is due to the parents' rejection of the child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have suffered trauma or serious child abuse before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals and some have lived on their own in the wild world.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, he/she has behaviors (within his/her physical possibilities) almost in a whole equal to those of the specific animal who cared for him/her, as well as his/her fear or indifference towards people.
Even though project-based learning should facilitate that process and make it more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, an assistance that provides support to those who are going through a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in both real and virtual format; otherwise, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but it is also the little animated clipboards of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is embedded in the software and its function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student alone.
Children are welcomed into foster care for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education; but it happens.
We can see that the family care system provides a safe area for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving guardians, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The aim of family care is to cover all the needs that were not met in the home of which they were previously collected.
Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different features presented by the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are mentioned as significant incentives for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study of users' reactions to websites led by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal participation" and "sustainable relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through video recording, there have been important findings in the interpretation of mycorepressions, which are movements on the face of only a few milliseconds of duration.
Specifically, it is argued that, by proper reading of their micro-expressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can, however, accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that the skills to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research work of the 20th century it has been shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The mutation process incorporates a new genetic variation; the selection process removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination sway the variation between one and another generation after generation.
In savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is equal to the human, to meet its amino acid needs with the plant resources available to it.
Moreover, it does not cause serious problems: slowing growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The proteins present in the leaves and legumes would have been the most simple source of plant resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except if cooked.
On the other hand, food derived from animals (hormies, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large number of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
In short, it should not surprise us if our own predecessors resolved their "protein problems" in the same way as the chimpanzees of the savannah today.
Sleep interruption consists of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and sleeping after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a more or less smooth alarm clock that makes it return to a conscious state, even without fully awakening it.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and address of your accommodation with local authorities.
Other options that are based on biological rhythm consist of drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before bed, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace enjoyed by a person is in contrast to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the force of life with which we count. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders the path is our tension and negativity.
While the basics of Tibetan Buddhism are Buddha's teachings, they were extended along the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In general terms, laism is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that covers everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (lighting) is activated with yoga positions, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels can be detached, chakras activated and the awareness of enlightenment developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the US was the result of confronting a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended by distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would extend for the next 40 years and would be truly fought, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other sites.
Because by 17 September 1939 the Polish defense was already broken, his only hope was to withdraw and reorganize in the extension of the Romanian bridge head.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost from one day to another, when more than 800,000 fighters from the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more effective way to move large numbers of people and goods through the oceans.
The role of the Navy has always been to ensure that its country retains the power to move its population and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II provides one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to move men and materials through the Atlantic Ocean in order to support Britain.
At the same time, the German army, mainly employing submersibles, tried to reverse this movement.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Britain, just as it did with the other European countries.
Apparently, the goats were first domesticated some 10,000 years ago in the Zagro Mountains in Iran.
In order to easily obtain their milk, hair, flesh and leather, the ancient peoples and tribes began to stay with them.
In general, domestic goats were gathered in herds that wandered through the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goats' shepherds who used to be children or adolescents, similar to the most popular shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
In England, the train tracks had already been installed around the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the wagons were made of simple parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that were pulling from them to achieve a higher speed and drag heavier loads than on the roads a little more slippery of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to keep the rails in place occurred quite early. However, gradually, they realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were coated with iron at their top.
This became a common practice, although iron caused a greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with other wheels made of iron and, in 1767, solid iron rails began to be used.
The first form of transportation that was known was walking. The human being began to do so in a position raised two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means man raised).
His predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking erect.
Although traces of bipedestation have been found in fossils of Australopitecos from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, the Sahelanthromus may have walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, be part of environmental movements or, even, we can become activists and fight to lessen, to some extent, future suffering.
It is, in many cases, like asymptomatic treatment. But if we do not seek only a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to disable them.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes, resulting from the technological and scientific advances of mankind, and the problems have intensified because of people's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent and signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are currently known as the "Dunlap copies".
It was John Nixon who first read the document and did it in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
On 6 July, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it to be read to his army in New York on 9 July. On 10 August, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and remains alive today.
Many people do not represent them as dinosaurs, since they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many features in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scalded limbs and claws, lay eggs and move on their back legs as well as the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers operate based on the manipulation of coded data under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1 and, according to the computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Your symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to give an immediate diagnosis.
The most clear indicator of internal poisoning can be found with an open bottle of toxic chemicals or medicines.
Read the label to have specific information on the first aid relevant to that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasite insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with the chinches, a species very developed to parasiticize humans.
Killers and bedbugs are nestling; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
Registered cases of multiple sclerosis (MC) in the US amount to about 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, brain binding, spinal cord and optic nerve, is the object of attack of multiple sclerosis.
Studies indicated that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from MS.
A couple could conclude that raising a baby would not be most convenient for them or the child.
These couples could choose to plan a baby's adoption.
In adoption, biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
It is not, however, an experiment, it is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was placed on classical works, especially in the Latin version of the Bible text.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially the questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the rule of the Greek language was declining, the West departed from its Greek roots both philosophical and scientific.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate self-sustainingly and have a period of free cyclical operation, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism often attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including animal and plant wildlife.
Some examples of possible activities on the site are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and ecosystem information study.
One example is to visit, take photographs and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and often cross over with others whose jobs are in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transfer shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Today, scientists claim that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the past two million years.
They all form part of society and make use of transport systems; and almost all complain about them.
In developed countries, similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapse are rarely heard.
What is the reason why transport systems give rise to complaints of such caliber and why there are daily failures? Are transport engineers simply incapable? Or is there something more substantial that is happening?
The traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not a simple task to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency on drivers to maintain relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to have logical consistency and may be subject to approximate mathematical representation.
In order to more clearly graph the flow of circulation, relations were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both the planning and design and the operation of road devices.
The first species to fly were the insects. This helped them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and couple more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to bend the wings backwards, hitting them on the sides of the body.
This provides them with a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, anisopters and ephemeropters are the only insects unable to bend their wings.
Millenniums ago, a man named Aristarco commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, as your movement is not perceived on Earth, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second most extensive river on the planet. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river on the planet, at some points with a range of up to six miles.
Of the total water coming from the rivers of the world that flows into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has an extension of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they could never be surpassed by those of Guiza, neither in size nor in the sublime technique of their building.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Empire were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time dated more than a millennium.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest.
Italian is used in Vatican City, both to draft its regulations and to issue its official communiqués.
The language spoken daily by the majority of those working within the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in Vatican City subscribe to the Roman Catholic religion.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since ancient times, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is formed by a combination of one or more of four elements: land, water, air and fire.
This was more similar to the states of matter (with identical order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, only at the same time had the theory that they are transformed into new substances that make up the things we see.
The alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements such as calcium and potassium. From now on, there are also metals of the type of gold and silver.
There may also be alloys with small amounts of elements, such as carbon, that are not metallic.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, composed of small particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so impressively small that the final point of this prayer could contain billions of them.
Therefore, when invented, the pencil gained many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computer screens. They don't even need to approach a sacapuntas.
You just have to wonder what's going to be on the keyboard when something newer comes up.
The atomic pump operates on the basis of the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when you roll a heavy cart up a hill. By dividing the core once again, it releases part of that energy.
The cores of some atoms are unstable, i.e. they tend to decompose with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon consists of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called bark.
The bark has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearby side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more seas on the nearby side because their bark is thinner, which made it easier for the lava to ascend to the surface.
Content theories focus on looking for what attracts or likes people.
These doctrines argue that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment force them to do or not to do certain things.
Two well-known theories are that of the need hierarchy of Maslow, and that of the two factors of Hertzberg.
In general, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to lead their former companions. On one side of the spectrum, there is an attempt to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
Managers in this category find it difficult to make decisions that harm employees, impose disciplinary measures, perform performance assessments, assign responsibilities and require accountability to staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, he moves into an unrecognizable person who thinks he needs to modify everything that the group has so far been doing and doing in his own way.
Ultimately, the ultimate leader of the team's success and failure is the leader.
This way of acting often ends up distancing the leaders from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that conventional equipment handle apply to virtuals, although there are small differences.
Members of a virtual team often operate as a contact point for their nearest physical group.
They generally enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, thanks to the fact that it is possible for their teams to meet according to different time zones that, for example, could not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual equipment.
The ‘invisible team' is the management group to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each member.
What could an organization have to submit to the applicant for the process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all available resources are used properly in an organization's operational departments, space is generated for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, it is possible that the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty of place to a new innovative process in order to meet the needs of customers.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. Therefore, they reduce the field of research and give it greater accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the power of new technologies, we have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes that occur in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material to develop simulation models, which favor our understanding of mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is highly associated with science fiction, it is a highly relevant specialty within computer science, which is responsible for behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are, among others, monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and consultations, as well as facial recognition, writing, voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The Artificial Intelligence system is now often used in the sectors of economy, medicine, engineering and militia, just as it was incorporated into various applications of video game software and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of any classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take his students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution comes from the hands of technology, through virtual excursions. Students can observe objects displayed in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also an excellent way to reflect on an exit and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital and each year the page is updated, but the previous versions that in the form of souvenir albums are kept online.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. Even though students usually start their blog experience with a poorly cared grammar and spelling, this usually changes in the presence of an audience.
Because students are usually the most critical readers, the blog writer begins to strive to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Also, the blog "requires students to be more understanding of the world than around them."The need to stimulate the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "may empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to internet content, can define their positions in the context of others' writings, in addition to setting their perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's captivating bilingual capital and has a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase Canada's history and current affairs.
The Niagara Falls are more south and the north houses the unexploded natural beauty of Muskoka and the extension that follows it.
All these aspects, among others, highlight Ontario as intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are wild, almost uninhabited.
To make a population comparison that causes great surprise to many: in the United States they live more African-American than Canadian.
The location of the islands of East Africa is on the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are popular for their luxury beaches and resorts.
Islam was also taken to land by the Arabs and was imposed, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial tip of European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route between Cape Europe and India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: All female visitors are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women must realize that cultural differences can cause what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, taken by the arm, etc.
Be round in rejecting men and do not fear defending their position (there are cultural differences or not, that is not right!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century B.C. and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenidas used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese under the name of Casa Branca, but in 1755 it was abandoned after an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan Sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who installed their businesses in that place called Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
In the vicinity of the ancient Medina, there are plenty of places where traditional Moroccan items are sold, such as clay pots, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole range of bagets, although everything is prepared for tourists.
Goma is a tourist resort in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern edge, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano lava destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city centre.
While Goma is quite certain, any overseas visit should be considered in order to learn about the situation of the ongoing clashes in the province of North Kivu.
In turn, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and its mountain gorillas sighting excursions are among the cheapest in Africa.
To move inside Goma, you can choose to take a wedding-boda (mototaxi). The regular (local) fare is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, in addition to being relatively inaccessible, has given "Tombuktu" an exotic and distant earth image.
Although today Tombuktu is an impoverished city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was incorporated into the list of places of humanity's heritage at risk, a result of the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops in the special Wonders of the African world, by Henry Louis Gates, in PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab-African style.
Kruger National Park (PNK) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, in each of which a different wildlife is developed.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all natural reserves in South Africa, there are daily rates for conservation and access to the park.
It may also be convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows you to enter park selections in South Africa or all the country's National Parks.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the homonymous island, which is the destination most tourists consider the main attraction.
The deployment of buildings delimiting the Hong Kong horizon has been compared with a luminous bar graph that is evidenced by the presence of the waters of Puerto Victoria.
The way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the riverbank of Kowloon, located in front.
It is in the recovered lands of the northern coast of Hong Kong where its urban development is densely concentrated.
This is the place the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of this region, it is a convenient place to start.
Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove chain in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans the heritage of humanity. The section of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Without prejudice to this, forests are not just mangroves, but possess some of the last remaining trees from the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans has an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its extension is covered by water or marshy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of wildlife and it is estimated that currently there are 400 royal tigers in Bengal and some 30,000 deer motified in the area.
Buses leave the station between districts (on the other side of the river) all day long, although most, especially those traveling to the east and to Jakarta (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Because buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is advisable to buy a ticket with a few days' advance.
Almost all districts have the Japanese Coaster bus service, which are comfortable and resilient.
Sharing a taxi trip is an agile and comfortable way to move to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River bridge is a drawn structure that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, a Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m wide.
Under the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not enabled for transit until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is for when Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The area that currently constitutes eastern Paraguay was inhabited by Guaraní, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as semi-nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence farming.
Each region housed other Aboriginal groups, such as the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who hunted, collected and fished as livelihoods.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of India", was born in the 16th century, as a product of the meeting between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the colonization phase, which extended for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its idiosyncrasy and Aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and the best polo players worldwide.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and lower matches can also be seen in other parts of the year.
On the website of the Association Argentina de Polo you will get information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The value of the Malvinas pound (FKP), the official currency of the Malvinas Islands, is fixed in equivalence with the British pound (GBP).
There's only one bank on the islands where you can change your money. It's in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Sterling pounds are usually accepted anywhere within the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There are chances that credit cards will not be accepted on the islands of the periphery, but you could use British or American money. Ask the owners in advance to be able to define which method of payment is accepted.
It is virtually impossible to change money from the Malvinas Islands outside the archipelago, so try to do so before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30°C during the summer.
The winter cold can be misleading: although it is very rare that temperatures are lower than the freezing point, the wind and humidity interact to make it felt colder than the thermometer points out.
There are no specific rainy or dry seasons; the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife does not cease to be wild, so it must not be fed or upset.
According to the authorities of the parks, at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from the rest of the wild animals should be kept.
Without prejudice to how meek they may look, the truth is that the bison, the uapaties, the moose, the bears and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Tens of visitors suffer injuries each year for not keeping an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially wild; therefore, respect their space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid having or cooking foods that release a lot of aroma and keep cleaning in the camp.
The capital of Samoa, the city of Apia is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
They sunk all the boats, except for a British cruise, and nearly two hundred American and German individuals died.
During the war for the independence of the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city had as balance the murder of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, because Auckland has two ports. The best known ones are in three areas.
In the North Harbour district of the Pacific Ocean, North Shore beaches are located, which spread from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
The beaches are almost all sandy with safe places to swim and mostly have pohutukawa trees that offer shaded places.
In the port of Waitemataas the beaches of Tamaki Drive are spread out, in the extravagant neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Helliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the thing. They are also safe to swim.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is the Manta.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better to transport.
The local tap water is completely safe for consumption, but, if you are concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
Australians consider the notion of "flat white" coffee foreign. A black coffee boy is called "spresso", cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but delicious.
Numerous trips to the reef are made throughout the year and, there, injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all signals and pay special attention to security alerts.
The cubemedusas are located near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers from October to April, north of 1770. Sometimes, they can be found outside this time.
Sharks do exist, but they hardly ever attack people. Most of them fear them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where the saltwater crocodiles actively reside. Its primary habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that are located north of Rockhampton.
The accommodation reservation in advance of the trip gives you the tranquility that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, but through them it is also possible to reserve other accommodation, such as camp areas.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.

Anyone who intends to drive in high latitudes or in mountain steps must foresee the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On roads with ice or snow, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as it does on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms a number of snow can fall so that it gets caught in very little time.
In addition, visibility can be reduced by snowfalls or by condensation or ice forming in the car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries the conditions of ice and snow are normal and transit flows almost without any interruption throughout the year.
The safaris are likely to be Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the most memorable part for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to land trips to see Africa's amazing wildlife, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach vehicles and the standard equipment will make a good view possible.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs and leopards can be shy, so you will have more chance to watch them using binoculars.

On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway, the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is one of the most challenging handling conditions and often runs loose and solitary terrain.
If you don't usually drive on rural roads, stay alert: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes and closed curves.
The established speed limits are notoriously lower than in the previous stages and in which they follow, usually from 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h), and their strict compliance is even more important than in any other section.
However, curiously, the signal of cell phones is much better here than in many other sections of the road such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is of good quality and, in Bavaria, cakes are quite tasty and varied, similar to those they prepare in Austria, their southern neighbor.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples cooked in their interiors throughout the year and cherries and plums that appear in the summer.

The stribos are the supports for the feet of the riders hanging on both sides of the riding chair.
While they provide greater stability to the rider, they may present security problems, as their feet may be attached to them.
If a rider is fired from the horse, but he has a foot stuck in the stride, he can be dragged if the animal flees. To reduce the risk, there is a series of safety recoveries.
First of all, most riders wear taco riding boots that have a ready and fairly narrow sole.
In addition, there are frames, especially the English ones, with safety bars that allow the leather of the stretcher to come out of its structure if a rider who gets fired pulls back.
The Cochamó Valley is the most popular climbing destination in Chile and is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of extensive walls and granite risks.

Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and plagenieve, are popular disciplines that consist of skiing or a table fixed to the feet, on a snowy terrain.
Skiing is a main activity of travel with many fans, sometimes called "ski lovers", who organize their holiday completely based on skiing in a specific site.
The idea of skiing is very old, since there are rock paintings representing skiers and dating back about 5,000 B.C.
As a discipline, alpine skiing dates from not after the 17th century. In 1861 the Norwegians inaugurated the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacker: also known as rural skiing, cross-country skiing or ski hiking.
Although they link, in general it does not involve practicing cross-country skiing or alpine-style mountaineering, developed on steep slope floors and with skis and footwear much more rigid.

Under satisfactory conditions, you will be able to travel a little longer distances than if you do on foot, but very rarely you will reach the speed of ski to the pass field without a backpack of good weight on conditioned slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling across several countries would mean having to manage visa applications and passport controls several times.
However, the Schengen area functions as a single country in this regard.
Usually, whenever you move within this region you will be able to cross borders without going through a passport control post again.
In the same way, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to manage permits for each of the member countries of this space separately. This will save you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion to determine when a manufactured good can be considered an antiquity. Some tax agencies have established that objects over 100 years of age are antiquities.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit could be more limited in places such as North America than in Europe.
It may occur that the products produced in craft form are classified as antiques, even though they are newer than goods of similar characteristics manufactured in series.
Reindeer breeding is a fundamental means of life between the lapones and the culture related to this commercial activity is important for many dedicated to other professions.
Yet, even traditionally, not all lapons have dedicated themselves to large-scale reindeer breeding, but have lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, using the reindeer, mainly as traction animals.
Today, many Laplands work in modern commercial activities. Tourism represents an important income in Lapland, the Sami region.

Due to underwater topology, the flow of return gathers in certain areas of greater depth and there can be a rapid flow with direction to deep waters.
Most of the deaths occur because of the fatigue caused by attempting to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back will not be more complex than usual.
Make an attempt to get to somewhere where you can't reach it again or, if you have the skills and someone has seen it, it might be convenient to wait for them to rescue you.
The impact of returning home occurs before the cultural (there is no period of happiness of 'myelmoon'), it takes longer to leave and it can be harder.
Travellers who were easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have many difficulties in adapting to their native culture.
When you return home after you reside abroad, you will have adapted to that new culture and lost some of the habits of your native culture.

People may not foresee that tolerance and understanding are also necessary for travellers back in their homes.

Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where there is a spectacular natural port formed by the flooded boiler of a volcano that remains active.
The Land of Ellsworth, whose boundaries are defined by the Sea of Bellingshausen, is a region that is located south of the peninsula.
In this place, the mountains of the Peninsula are mixed with the plateau and then resurface to form the 360 km mountain range of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided into two by the Minnesota glacier.
In the north, sentinel mountain range, there are the highest peaks in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a peak at 4892 meters on Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, where cell phone coverage does not arrive, a satellite device could be your only option.
A satellite phone cannot be matched to a mobile phone, because, to make a call, it must be outdoors and with a clear line of vision towards the satellite.
The service is usually used in water transport, including recreational boats, as well as for expeditions that require remote data and voice.
You can consult with your local telephone service provider for more information on how to join this service.
Combining travel and learning has become a very popular option among those planning to take a sabbatical year.
This is very popular among school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before college without putting their education at risk.
In many cases, enrolling in a study programme abroad for a sabbatical year can, in fact, increase the possibilities of access to higher education once you return to the country of origin.
A registration fee will normally be charged to enroll in these educational programmes.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing: the "land of the thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You don't always need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
While coastal archipelagos and more caudal lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks provide a different experience.
Sailing is a national recreational activity in Finland, with one boat every seven or eight inhabitants.

In the brochures of some cruises appears Berlin, Germany. However, as seen on the map above, this city is not located near the sea and its visit is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can cause fear in people of any age and place, particularly if they have never been through the experience or if they have experienced any traumatic situation.
It should not be ashamed for this: nothing differs from other kinds of personal fears and displeasures that afflict so many others.
For some, understanding a little how airplanes operate and what happens during a flight can make it easier to leave behind a fear that stems from lack of knowledge or the feeling of not having control.
Messenger companies are paid very well for making fast deliveries. Often, time is very important when it comes to commercial documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Large companies have their own planes on some routes, but there was a problem for smaller companies and other routes.
If they made an air freight shipment, some routes may have taken days in unloading and customs.
The only option to do so faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airlines regulations prohibit carrying baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come into play.
The obvious way to travel in the first class or in the executive class of an airplane is to spend a fortune for that privilege (or, what is best, make your company pay for you).
But this has a price: in general terms, you can get to pay up to four times as much the economic rate in business class and up to eleven in class.
Usually, it's silly to look for discounts for first class seats or business class on direct flights.
Airlines are well aware that there is a basic group of travellers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to a place quickly and comfortably, and to charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. Its regional language is Romanian, although Russian is also very spoken.
Moldova is a republic composed of many ethnic groups, among which such conflicts have arisen.
