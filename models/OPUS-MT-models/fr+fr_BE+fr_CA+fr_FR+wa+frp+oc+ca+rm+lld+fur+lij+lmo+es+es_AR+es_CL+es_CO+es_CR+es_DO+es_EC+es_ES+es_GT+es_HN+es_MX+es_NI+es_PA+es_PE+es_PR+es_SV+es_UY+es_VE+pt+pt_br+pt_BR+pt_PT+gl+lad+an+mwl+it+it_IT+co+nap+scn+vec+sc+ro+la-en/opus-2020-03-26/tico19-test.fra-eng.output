Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar developments in the EU/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a peak of patients with VOCID-19 requiring care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with VOCID-19 have a benign condition, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
In approximately 14% of cases, VOCID-19 causes a more severe attack requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a severe form of disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality of hospitalized patients due to VOCID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we assess the cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 in each of the EU/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with the evolution of Hubei Province in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of VOCID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, VOCID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the VOCID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are now following that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that VOCID-19 is a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of VOCID-19 confirmed in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 by people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of VOCID-19 had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom (UK) with between 31 December 2019 and that date 39,768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative number and cumulative incidence of cases of VOCID-19
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECPM), the number of cases of VOCID-19 reported in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities in different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of VOCID-19 within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare it with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of VOCID-19, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of VOCID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural evolution of VOCID-19, within each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of reported cases in each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8 a.m. with Italy's data for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Evolution of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The 14-day cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 began to increase around 21 February before a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This development was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom presented a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of VOCID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of VOCID-19 is increasing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in the responses of national public health services, potential variations in case definitions, and differences in the selection protocols for patients to be tested for VOCID-19 confirmation, including for catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, physicians in the affected regions of Italy indicated that approximately 10% of patients with VOCID-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of cases of VOCID-19 to hospitals and/or intensive care are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not presented).
There is, however, a need for systematic collection to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a significant difference in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care per 100,000 individuals in 2010–11).
Modeling scenarios related to the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalised COPID-19 cases associated with an &gt risk; 90% excess capacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECCPM rapid risk assessment for COPID-19.
Since the cases were so far grouped in some regions of the EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care services generally host a defined regional population, data on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be established at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the VOCID-19 pandemic is rapidly advancing in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 as well as for an increase in the number of patients with VOCID-19 requiring care, in particular intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent rapid risk assessment of CEPCM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not leave enough time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented upstream.
Rapid risk assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window in which each country will be able to strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Otherwise, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the days or weeks to come.
The 2019 Coronavirus Disease Epidemic (COVID-19), caused by Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which led to thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissive, and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this growing research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
While many questions are still waiting for answers, we hope that this review will help to better understand and eradicate this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, on January 25, 2020, has forever marked the Chinese, who have been forced to remain cloistered for the duration of the golden week as well as for many other weeks because of the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to coronavirus (CoV) which caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003; therefore it was baptized SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and associated disease called coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of VOCID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 studies have been published on VOCID-19, including in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 presenting the virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this emerging topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another Coronavirus disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that occurred in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and will address some outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, causing mainly about 15% of common colds 4.
However, during this century, we experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current VOCID-19 is therefore the third outbreak of coronavirus in recent history.
As presented in Fig. 1.1, then unknown outbreaks of pneumonia were first reported to Wuhan on December 31, 2019 with the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was revealed.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic had spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined with interruption of all public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, in 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan Seafood Market, considered the starting point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO described the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of writing, the disease had already spread to all of China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of VOCID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7 per cent) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men more (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 developed in homes, mainly in Hubei province and in the periphery.
The mean duration between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of VOCID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproductive rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until 23 January 2020, which coincided with the massive displacements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86 %), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59 %).
The three main risk factors for VOCID-19 were gender (man), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large wrapped viruses containing a single strand RNA.
They can be classified into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronavirus known to infect humans belonging to alpha and beta genera.
The glycoprotein Spike (S) of the envelope binds to the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) and to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then a membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples taken from the source site of the epidemic, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using electron microscopy in transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium in the respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by orf3b as well as a secreted protein coded by orf8.
The ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the ORF8 does not contain known functional domains or motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the complete human ACE2 cryo-ME structure at a 2.9 Å complex resolution with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediate host
It has been established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came from bats and that they were transmitted to Man via civettes and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect Man remains unknown, and the transmission path is still to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., hypothesized that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which would imply homologous recombination within protein S.
According to a study conducted by researchers from Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a long musk mammal feeding on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if it is judged by genetic homology at 99% between a coron virus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 per cent difference between two genomes is a significant difference; therefore, conclusive results should be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 could very well have similar properties.
It would appear that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays as well as to a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll type receptors (TLRs), NOD type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I type receptors (RLRs).
In different ways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Aid T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defense cells.
However, coronavirus may inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing apoptosis.
Humor immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a restored patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious injury to the lungs as well as other organs and, in the worst scenario, multivisceral failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by home onset, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, but generally more than 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 reported cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days, for a range of 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded a 4.8-day incubation period (3.0-7.2) based on a demography of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the actual duration of quarantine according to a period of incubation as precise as possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Does the quarantine have to be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of VOCID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, thoracic pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
Regarding serious cases, patients rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus in order to allow an early diagnosis.
A demographic study carried out at the end of December 2019 showed that the patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of the patients needed ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported by two recent studies on a family and a household that occurred following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, much more than patients with VOCID-19, which is consistent with higher lethality of the MERS compared to VOCID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with ESRM.
Regarding SARS, the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25 %) and sore throat (13%-25 %), and ventilation assistance was required for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
As at 14 February, the mortality of VOCID-19 was 2 per cent, for 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
According to a demographic survey conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 reached 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) at 95% of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only 2-4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much harder to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it was for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance of a home often occurs in a family or in a gathering or a vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often travelled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been demonstrated that individuals may be carriers of the virus without presenting symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have been re-established may be carriers of the virus again, which underlines the need to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a number of white cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, as well as a high rate of aspartate aminotransferase and viraemia were identified in 1,099 patients with VOCID-19.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the D-dimer rate, a product of degradation of the fibrin present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes was gradually decreasing.
There are chest X-ray abnormalities in most patients with VOCID-19, characterized by unequal bilateral shadows or depolitic glass opacity at the lung level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS).
In the case of ADRS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes results in a decrease in surfactant levels and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most disturbing thoracic tests often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of VOCID-19 revealed a dequamation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which coincides with viral infection and ADRD pathology and resembles that of patients with SARS and ESRM.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of VOCID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was then no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation was observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the CRISPR technology for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which identifies synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a reactive strip in less than one hour, without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is to be hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality, if its use on clinical specimens was conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide support to patients with VOCID-19, while attempting a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, restored patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma in restored patients was proposed for treatment.
The pharmaceutical companies are all working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OCEM), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolytic balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as protecting the functions of vital organs, are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Excessive immune response has been shown to result in cytokinic shock in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multi-visceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic shocks, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinic shocks include modulation of immune response by T-cells, blocking of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF, inhibition of JAKs, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 reporting suppressor and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high dose steroids did not have any beneficial effects on severe lung lesions in patients with SARS and VOCID-19.
Instead, they would cause serious side effects, including an avascular osteonecrosis, thus significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, careful use of short cycles of low- to moderate-dose corticosteroids was recommended for patients with a severe form of VOCID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous resuscisivation, a nucleoside analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remedisivir is a new antiviral medicine originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, resuscisor also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single-strand RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these findings, Gilead transmitted the compound to China to allow for a number of trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir combination and ribavirin were advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of patients recovered and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have cured a contagious disease in order to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the disease is an ancestral practice.
In fact, re-established patients often have a relatively high rate of antibodies to the pathogen.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from VOCID-19 and injected 10 seriously affected patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, in combination with decreased inflammation, reduced viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to be able to propose this method for large-scale use until any specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat severely ill patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and effective to isolate B cells from restored patients and to identify genetic codes coding relevant antibodies or to seek effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would rapidly increase antibody production.
MTC has been used for millennia in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on the MTC theories.
Most effective components remain little or no known insofar as it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific effective treatment for VOCID-19, TCM is one of the major alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or remission of a serious form of disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have proven effective in the treatment of VOCID-19.
The best rates of recovery for VOCID-19 were observed in provinces in China that used TCM for 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei, which used only 30% of patients with VOCID-19, had the lowest rate of recovery (13%).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison, since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, need to be considered for evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study comparing treatment using Western Medicine (MO) only and combined treatment involving MO and TCM.
It appeared that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to disappear symptoms and the length of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only.
Even more impressive, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%); similarly, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM remains to be clarified through more scaled-up controlled trials and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of VOCID-19 are generally deeply concerned about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those quarantined also experience a feeling of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion, and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact research and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt on the part of patients regarding the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of their families and friends.
For example, mental health care should be provided to patients with VOCID-19, to individuals identified as probable cases, to people in contact with these populations, and to any other person in distress.
This psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of infected animal reservoirs and humans to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines to produce powerful long-term neutralising antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and on models subject to lethal provocation and their protection from zoonotic virus infection remains to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS died 17 years ago and that no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge because of the significant delay (18 months on average) needed to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations in coronaviruses.
To the extent that it is an emerging disease, VOCID-19 is just beginning its clinical development through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, VOCID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most severe cases.
Therefore, establishing a forecast model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies conducted so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with VOCID-19 are as follows (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor for SARS prognosis, and this also seems to be the case for VOCID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals between the ages of 30 and 65, with 47.7% over 50 years of age, according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age of 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting age as a predictor for patients with VOCID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with VOCID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in patients with VOCID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the C-reactive protein (CRP) level in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage; it has been advanced as a potential predictor of disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between the CRP rate and severity and the prognosis of VOCID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also be involved in establishing the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released in case of tissue damage.
They are therefore traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: thoracic X-ray results and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other elements for the determination of prognosis and complications of VOCID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as supplemental therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high dose corticosteroids have been widely used in serious SARS cases, many survivors have experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent incapacity and poor quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with VOCID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the outbreak of VOCID-19 has resulted in a large number of exceptional stress cases, with patients often experiencing long quarantine periods, extreme uncertainty, and the death of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and recover a normal life.
According to demographic studies to date, VOCID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to being replicated in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also responds effectively in the upper respiratory tract and does not or does not cause symptoms in the first phase of the infection, like coronaviruses that cause common colds.
As a result, newly infected or incubated individuals can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly hinders the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by severely ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current outbreak of VOCID-19 is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than was the SARS epidemic.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost all the population with a view to halting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the phase of decline will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believe that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not be extinguished in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in samples of the middle nasal cornet and throat of patients recovered, 2 weeks after they left the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode like influenza.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with the gradual reduction of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to the initial forecasts, Ebola virus was expected to cause up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, thanks to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally placed under control.
It is possible, as for SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectivity to eventually extinguish itself or evolves into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with Man.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by cough or sneezing, and also possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in stools, thus revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
Precautionary measures should therefore be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of patients, and even anyone who may be in contact with infected patients or persons.
The first line of defense possible to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) participates in controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition to surfaces where they could be transmitted to others.
However, only the N95 (1860) masks provide protection against the inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions capable of entering completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, since both measure about 85 nm.
Because particles are able to cross five surgical masks stacked on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 (1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals must wear adjusted insulation blouses in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have penetrated its body through the eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, health professionals should also wear transparent visors or eyeglasses in contact with patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to wash hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to remain confined to the maximum and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
It is advisable to maintain a distance of one metre with the patients.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new human virus, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China in high alert condition after the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the population by stating that the new virus was not contagious, that it had limited interhuman transmissibility and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a remarkable relaxation, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
Chinese disease control agencies need to learn from this and take the necessary action.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, because each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official bodies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at its beginnings rather than trying to reassure the population; and (4) perform more targeted and relevant exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to test and improve the society's response system on a regular basis.
The outbreak of VOCID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing this report, it has spread to all of China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
To the extent that this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and that the symptoms of VOCID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the outbreak of VOCID-19 gives rise to an impression of already-vu.
However, there are significant differences between VOCID-19 and SARS, which need to be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
VOCID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women; severity and mortality rates are also higher among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than VOCID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Transmission of the VOCID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by severely ill patients; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the spread of VOCID-19.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 has spread much faster and much wider than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for some patients with VOCID-19.
On the other hand, re-established patients may again be positive for the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of spread.
Despite the rapid progress of research on VOCID-19, several critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 comes from chiroptera.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the initial host virus, e.g. bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively stop transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter respiratory cells and how does it result in pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to the ACE2-expressing cells of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and precise diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve in genetic terms during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or resurface regularly like influenza?
It is essential, even if it may take some time, to get answers to all these questions as well as to many others.
However, no matter what expenses this entails, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only a few immunocompromised patients experienced severe infection in the lower respiratory tract.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdong in China.
In addition to the supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases with a period of incubation between 4 and 7 days, with the peak viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, failed liver function tests and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory tests in cases of SARS suspicion.
Spread alveolar lesions, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20 to 30 per cent of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokinic shock, which may be fatal in particular in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal sampling of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in a 71-year-old man hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS resemble those of SARS and are characterized by acute evolutionary pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with SRM also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of SRM compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses known in humans.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid worldwide spread.
Comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of the other six HCVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of VOCID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four Community HcoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of VOCID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like the other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and its sustainable diffusion after transmission to humans, will have an influence on the ultimate fate of the current outbreak of VOCID-19.
The four community HCoVs causing moderate symptoms were well adapted to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
With this in mind, the more the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the greater the number of infected people, the more likely the virus is to fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by about 40 or other measures of infection control.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogenic, have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoV acquired in community.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCV and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among them without a tank or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoV.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of an HCoV if it houses a nearby ascendant sharing a high homology in the nucleotide sequence.
The original virus has often adapted well and is non-pathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a tank host houses HCoV on a continuous and long-term basis.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, given that 80% of the animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate host amplifiers cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
That is why bats cannot be the intermediate tank host of the MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies conducted in the Middle East have shown that dromadaria were seropositive to specific antibodies neutralising the MERS-CoV, as well as camels originating in the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also via faeces, which is also the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even less than the distance between beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from the pangolin.
Recombination is a common factor in beta-coV evolution.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could be derived from bat coV, whereas parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of bats close to the HCoV-229E have been found.
First, unlike alpaca, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpaca.
Second, the alpha-CoV of bats related to HCoV-229E are numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas the alpha-CoV of alpaca caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca's alpha-coV has not been found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogen viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit the HCoV-229E directly to man.
Another possibility, while bat-coV alpha-coVs serve as a genetic reservoir of the HCoV-229E, alpaca and dromedaria could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-coV.
The MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the interspecies transmission of bats to dromedaries and dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV found in bats is known thanks to its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been present in the drugstores for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels that have moved from intermediate host to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-coV is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats through scraping or coal mines.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the removal and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species having been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is under way.
Compared to other single-strand RNA viruses, estimated CoV mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per site per year, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to new hosts.
However, the rates of mutation of the CoVs are about one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
It can be assumed that he has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to the drugs.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, the CoVs randomly and frequently change their model when the RNA is replicated through a single "choice-copy" mechanism.
phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for coV observed in animals, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Transmission-related virus-host interaction
Beyond these three viral factors indicated above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in adapting the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
A study by electronic cryomicroscopy indicates a 10-20-fold affinity of this bond compared to that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and HCoV natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, dromadaries and rodents, could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Emergency of new HCoV: return to the departure box
The diversity of bat CoVs offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs are genetic reserves of HCoVs.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, since bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated but coded divergent ORF8 proteins.
This deletion splits the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is perceived as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the outbreak of MERS-CoV has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca's alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, generating a shift in the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their tank hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that bats had adapted well to the CoV from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the disease triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RODs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect "rereading" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombinant, generating new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They respond firmly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes cases of severe human infection reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammation is failing in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of VOCID-19.
While a bat-coV beta-coV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-coV has been discovered, there is also a bat-coV coV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-coV-2.
Pangoline beta-CoV remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangoline beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The CoVs returned under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the drugstore for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, together with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat coVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of the consumption of wild animals in certain parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of coVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses reservoirs.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under which circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical objective of handwashing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may be harmful or cause disease.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction of infant mortality during home births.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as soap-washing.
Pneumonia, one of the leading ARIs, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, accounting for nearly 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia lead to the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Handwashing also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive handwashing can lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common in health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
Deparasitage twice a year, associated with daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleaner for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic soil matter, are difficult to soluble in water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protector, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid with antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils with dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of warm water does not contribute to reducing microbial load on hands.
A hand disinfectant or an antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or with a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), and fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for the hands or hydroalcoholic solution must be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid removal activity from microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate handwashing unless you have any soap and water at your fingertips.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or moisturizing agents of the skin.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water products do not eliminate organic matter on their hands, but only disinfect them.
That is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for non-alcoholic hands depends heavily on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride had a long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases rather than stop them.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Moisten hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make any difference).
Sprinkle a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
The soap eliminates the germs of the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse abundantly with running water.
Rinsing in a pond of stagnant water can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and wet hands are more easily recontained.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the underside of the nails.
Artificial nails and scalded nail polish can accommodate microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or soap are not available.For example, pour water from a can or gourd suspended and pierced and/or use ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tippy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging crutch using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is to debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are often found in the toilets.
After the washing and drying of hands in the hot air dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194 per cent on the pulp of the fingers and 254 per cent on the palms.
Air-jet hand-drying led to an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After hand drying, the following changes in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Handwashing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during movement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
The medical washing of the hands shall last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hands mousse and rub.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
The objective of handwashing in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and to avoid their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/organic fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewellery must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for the hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of handwashing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of handwashing beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand-washing stations.
However, low levels of handwashing may also be due to tenacious habits, rather than lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to the final three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The World Day of Handwashing is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that aims to promote behavioural change.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap-washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the fetid odors called miasms.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand-washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports.
The term "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to take responsibility or to be accomplices to something.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory "purification" measures, such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam demand to wash their hands before and after each meal.

Because it's the flu season.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in virus genomes, which are most likely due to pressures during selection, particularly by the host's immune system.
For example, the loss of the complete ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E is due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca's alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, generating a shift in the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their tank hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that bats had adapted well to the CoV from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the disease triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low rate of expression of the molecules of the major Class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RODs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect "rereading" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombinant, generating new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They respond firmly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes cases of severe human infection reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammation is failing in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of VOCID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat-coV beta-coV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-coV has been discovered, there is also a bat-coV coV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-coV-2.
While cives and other animals on the markets have been found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Pangoline beta-CoV remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangoline beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has been designed by man, whether voluntarily or accidentally.
The CoVs returned under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coVs in bats and other animals has greatly altered our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HcoVs to humans.
Numerous factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from bats and are transmitted to man by intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and civettes on the markets, the closure of fresh product markets and the killing of civettes there could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
According to the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from fresh product markets to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, if so, how this transmission occurs will remain to be determined in the studies that follow.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the drugstore for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as was done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, together with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat coVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new more transmissible and/or deadly CoVs in man in the future.
The cultivation of the consumption of wild animals in certain parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Although bats have many characteristics favourable to the spread of viruses, the likelihood for humans to be in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are sensitized to the need to stay away.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of coVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses reservoirs.
Not all secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are known yet.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under which circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be performed.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Future research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of VOCID-19 in humans.
Updating the diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" of VOCID-19 is necessary
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Quick Recommendation Directive for the diagnosis and treatment of the new 2019 Coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to fight this pandemic globally.
However, the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "suspicious case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of VOCID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute coronavirus 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was posted online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It has attracted much attention since its publication.
However, please note that VOCID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge progress slowly on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for VOCID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were published in a total of seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which were substantially modified.
Our directive, which received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has brought new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We support their important work and thank them.
However, their work should also be updated according to the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for VOCID-19 (Seventh version trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspect case must involve one of the features of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological antecedents:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and neighbouring areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a confirmed case cluster (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in a reduced area such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging with the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case must be based on the suspect case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with known new coronary viruses; (3) positive serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody; or modification of the specific IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or titre increase ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or in blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic screening of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and to the fifth edition (8 February 2020) and then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of caution with regard to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classify people with no clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system should also be checked in clinical practice and future studies.
In conclusion, we hope for more direct evidence and ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that they follow and follow the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in a timely manner to offer its assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to VOCID-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to VOCID-19 in a single day.
The country thus records a record of mortality due to the virus in a single day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered infected persons included 114 active cases and 33 cured persons, who remained confined at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transportation of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still permitted.
On March 19, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Across the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the confinement of the city until May 1.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially fatal an infection with HCoV could be.
Most HCoVs come from bats where they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Studying the CoV-host interactions in animals could also improve understanding of CoV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The genus Beta-CoV contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, whereas birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The tracing of the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of the crossing of the species barrier.
It may also guide or facilitate the search for the tank host(s), intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the prevention of future contagions.
Animal coVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and subsequently adapted to increase in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of classical cold, including headaches, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough observed in 10 to 20% of cases.
Both the HCoV-229E and the HCoV-OC43 are present around the world and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter, in temperate climate countries.
Stores in Australia Reduce limit quantities of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian stores Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper to two and a package by purchase in all stores nationally, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a limit of a package.
These limits were displayed in the form of messages to the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
The buyers apparently raised reserves for fear of COVID-19 and the need to confine.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home deliveries to a package by order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of 8 March, said that with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are still out of stock within the hour after delivery," and called the request "unprecedented," while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, called it "unexpected."
Sales experienced a "high increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco store in Canberra also restricted the authorized quantity to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI provided earlier stocks for a planned Wednesday promotion.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailer Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make the task difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, while suppliers are trying to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some stores are unable to honor Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores restock every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a large item, resulting in stocks of a small quantity that, once exhausted, leave large empty spaces in rays, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
"Colles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, it will probably reduce panic," explained Russell Zimmerman to ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper who manufactures Sorbent paper, pointed out that they work 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to News.com.au's article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder during auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auction sales were organized due to the fact that buyers were on leave during the long weekend of the Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to ABC Australia's March 3 report in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce acquisition restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also experienced high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed Sunday night that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization qualifies VOCID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the current outbreak of VOCID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) as pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease, and not to the danger of specific cases, WHO indicated the need to move governments to action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO.
"We are deeply concerned, not only about the alarming levels of spread and gravity, but also about the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He stated, in statements published by CNN in February, that "apart from influenza, no other respiratory viruses have been observed since its emergence until its continued worldwide spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
What he added: "and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the epidemic: "To be short, the situation will get worse."
On Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of VOCID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an epidemic of coronavirus disease in progress since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of VOCID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The rate of lethality is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to cough, staying away from other people, as well as monitoring and confining people suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world have responded by introducing restrictions on movement, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has led to serious socio-economic disturbances worldwide, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information on the virus has been circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of Asian origin and appearance in the East and South-East, as well as against other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and closures in the heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported an outbreak of unknown cause pneumonia on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to Huanan's wholesale seafood market and it is therefore believed that the virus would be zoonotic.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first known person with symptoms had fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no obvious connection with the subsequent home of the fresh product market.
Of the first home cases reported in December 2019, two thirds proved to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could date back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old person from Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases appeared to decrease in China but suddenly increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong underestimation of cases, especially among those with benign symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, those aged 19 and under representing 2.4 per cent of the world's cases. UK Chief Science Advisor Patrick Vallance estimated that 60 per cent of the British population had to be infected before they could achieve effective collective immunity.
The cases refer to the number of people tested at VOCID-19, whose test was confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had the official policies not to test those with only benign symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, until 23 January, 86 per cent of undetected VOCID-19 infections were estimated in China, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79 per cent of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than reported cases.
The first estimates of the basic reproduction rate (R0) of VOCID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with VOCID-19 are cured.
For those who do not heal, the delay between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to VOCID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75% were suffering from pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official counts of death related to the VOCID-19 pandemic generally refer to deceased persons who have been tested positive for VOCID according to official protocols.
The number of actual victims of VOCID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include untested deceased persons - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy show that the numbers of overmortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of the deaths of the COVID.
A spokesperson for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is underestimated," a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of the under-assessment in the United States. Such underestimation often occurs in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica, and several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time since the outbreak began, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-death ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to statistics from Johns-Hopkins University, the global case-death ratio is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) to 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the case-death ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms that occurred between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms that occurred after 1 February 2020). Other indicators are the lethality rate (fatality rate), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with disease, and the infection rate (infection rate), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have disease.
These statistics are not limited over time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall pandemic infection rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for VOCID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of the tests on estimates of the lethality rate.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania said: "Without control, infectious epidemics usually stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease comes to lack of available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment when this will happen."
China's Chief Medical Advisor Zhong Nanshan said that "this could be completed by June" if all countries succeed in mobilizing to follow WHO's recommendations on measures to curb the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two."
According to an Imperial College study conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—for it is very easily transmitted—will disappear completely" and that it "could turn into seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year."
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of VOCID-19 are sometimes rather non-specific and the infected may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosity), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people are seriously ill and have respiratory difficulties.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC) identify emergency symptoms such as respiratory distress, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakenings, and the face or lips of blueberries; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. Subsequent disease development can lead to severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septicemia, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, then researchers issued recommendations that people who have had close contact with infected confirmed people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out the risk of infection.
Chinese asymptomatic ratio assessments range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is more often than five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people carrying VOCID-19 who lost smell was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly during close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking; this close contact corresponding to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by fine droplets that would remain in the air over longer periods, which could be projected by talking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected during the expiration, including by talking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
Postillons can land in the mouth or nose of other people next door or even be inhaled in the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and thus cause air spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it can be transmitted through the saddles, this risk is considered to be low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of faeco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however the spread may be possible before the symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People have been tested positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms occur suggesting that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
Only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during contact search investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if we do not yet know exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Domestic animals and other animals have been tested positive at VOCID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however the UK authorities recommend washing their hands after touching animals, as after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have affected.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to the acute respiratory disease of Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think he'd be of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B) associated with two strains from bats.
It is identical to 96% of the genome of another sample of bats coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid of difference in some parts of the genome sequences between pangolin and human-derived viruses.
The comparison of the genome as a whole has so far revealed a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolin is the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but final confirmation is done by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scanning.
A study comparing PCR and scanning to Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the scanner be not used to detect or as a first-intention test to diagnose VOCID-19".
WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test may be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours or days.
Generally, this test is performed on a rhinopharynx sample, but a throat sample can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them proved to be reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and tomography (scanner) of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral depoli glass opacities and a lack of pleural effusion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to the overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR-confirmed imaging is limited in accuracy to detect VOCID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of thoracic scanners to the PCR and showed that if imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its inclusion as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect characteristics of the virus in imaging both on X-rays and scanners.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include having overall good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
Those who were already contaminated were recommended to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission; many governments have banned or discouraged all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in vast areas of the planet.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. Health professionals who care for someone who may be infected are advised to take the usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and wear protective glasses. Contact research is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments in this regard raised confidentiality issues, with Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations publishing a press release calling for limits to such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been launched or proposed on the basis of volunteering, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the presence of a user near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive at COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, rinse the nose and gargle with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine against VOCID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having sucked, coughed, or sneezed.
It is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended using a disinfectant for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not easily accessible.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be decontaminated in several ways (within one minute of exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 % ethanol, 50–100 % isopropanol, 0.1 % sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 % hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5 % iodine povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a nursery, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouths and noses with their folded elbows or handkerchiefs when they cough or sneeze, and to throw any handkerchiefs immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by the projected postillons by talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO issued instructions explaining where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Bringing a mask can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene."The use of masks has also been recommended to those who care for a person potentially affected by the disease.
WHO recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they take care of a patient with VOCID-19, even if it recognizes that wearing masks can help people not touch their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their populations to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the wearing of non-medical tissue masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially in the case of proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to make facial masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned outings in public without masks or other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone would protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that anyone entering a supermarket wear a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the wearing of the mask on passengers of long distance trains and buses on April 1.
Panama has made the wearing of a mask mandatory for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of an artisanal mask to those who cannot buy it.
Masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also called physical distance) includes measures to control infections to slow the spread of the disease by decreasing contacts between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
The methods of social distance can be applied by staying at home, limiting his travels, avoiding crowds, saluting himself without contact and keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments are now ordering or recommending social distance in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum level of gatherings recommended by U.S. government and health agencies has been rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known VOCID-19 presence in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system were at increased risk of serious illness and complications, and they were invited by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in the areas affected by the epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the term "social distance" with "physical distance", to clarify the objective of reducing physical contact by preserving social ties, whether virtually or by keeping a distance.
The use of the term "social distance" suggested that total social isolation should be used, rather than encouraging people to maintain contact with others through other means. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sexual intercourse only with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus, or who does not have the symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for people diagnosed positive with VOCID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health organizations have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation. Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at-risk groups.
People who have been exposed to a patient with VOCID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where transmission is very important have been invited to place themselves in quarantine for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
Strategies for controlling an epidemic are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
The containment is introduced in the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other measures to control infection and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
Where it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are directed towards the mitigation phase: steps are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Mitigation and containment measures can be taken at the same time.
Removal requires more extreme measures, in order to inflate the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproduction to less than 1. Part of the management of an epidemic of infectious disease is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overburdening health services and saves time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and individual quarantine; public social distance measures such as closure of schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage acceptance of such interventions and participation in them; and environmental actions such as surface cleaning. More drastic measures to control the epidemic have been taken in China as the severity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as quarantine of entire cities and a strict travel ban.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced localized mass screening and quarantine, and issued alerts on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to those infected who took quarantine, and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and has sanctioned the seizure of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (the reversal of the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the demand for health care by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
Removal may be preferred, but it must be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this happens first), because otherwise, transmission bounces rapidly when the measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for VOCID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing treatment tests.
Taking medicines without a prescription against cold or drinking, as well as rest, can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of VOCID-19.
WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" may soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increase in capacity and the adaptation of health care for the needs of patients with VOCID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines to hospitals and primary health care services for the redeployment of resources to different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to the VOCID-19 tests, cancelling non-emergency interventions where possible, separating and insulating tested patients positive to VOCID-19, and strengthening intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories regarding the place of origin of the very first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus may date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are usually linked to Huanan's wholesale seafood market, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia outbreak was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Province Hospital, who informed Wuhan Jianghan's CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then published a public opinion on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to trigger an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by Chinese New Year's migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub and a major place of railway correspondence.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy by displaying the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364 000 healed.
Approximately 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted movement and introduced border controls.
National responses included containment measures such as quarantine measures (also known as orders to stay at home, shelter on site or containment) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are subjected to containment in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people in the world had a form of confinement, a figure of 2.6 billion two days later — about one third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of VOCID-19 was dated to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the very first case would date back to November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an unknown case of pneumonia on December 26, of which she informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on December 27.
Initial genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronary virus.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
The doctors in Wuhan received a warning for "propagating rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "obvious evidence" of human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the greatest quarantine in human history", a health cord was announced on January 23 to stop travel from and to Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles has been banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as congress and stadium centres, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to stem the outbreak of VOCID-19, including the issuance of health reports for travellers and the extension of Spring Day holidays.
Universities and schools in the country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
The control of population displacement has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have been involved in some form of displacement restriction. After the epidemic entered the world stage in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a quarantine of 14 days for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted inside the country within the previous five days, in this case via a traveller returning to Canton from Istanbul.

A CNN report indicated that the combination between the large elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all those with the virus to date could have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first appeared to be one of the most flexible among the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government did not impose any form of social distancing or quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for its manifest lack of responsiveness and vitality in response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement, disadvising all non-essential travel and social contacts, suggesting that people work from home if possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and entertainment rooms.

On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in the Latin American and African regions. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in the management and containment of the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004, where Chinese authorities had been accused of concealment that had impeded prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government "provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the Lunar New Year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban to Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea pointed out that although it was "not a WHO recommendation", it was, however, a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and he spoke of an "unprecedented fact in the history of public health." On 30 January, following confirmation of an interhuman transmission outside China and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO stated that the epidemic was an international public health emergency (USPI), the sixth USPI since the measure was invoked during the 2009 influenza A pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom stated that USPI was due to "the risk of global spread, especially for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros stated: "There is no reason for measures to interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel".
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to support strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgent need to support those countries that "do not have the necessary systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it is about to appear".
Tedros then stated that we were "as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more tomorrow." On February 11, WHO established in a press conference that the disease was named COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to include the "force of the entire United Nations system in the response".
A United Nations crisis management team has therefore been activated to coordinate the entire United Nations response, which according to WHO will allow them to "focus on health response while other agencies will be able to provide expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic".
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team was activated in China to dispatch international experts and WHO on-site in China to support national management and assess "the severity and transmission of disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with key national institutions and conducting field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including in urban and rural areas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic", indicating that although it is too early to speak of pandemics, each country should nevertheless enter "preparation phase".
In response to the development of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint on-site mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO representatives stated that the global threat assessment for coronavirus had shifted from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Management Program, warned in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to stand ready," adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan then indicated that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that "we accept that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus".
On 11 March, WHO stated that the Coronavirus epidemic could be described as a pandemic.
The Director General stated that WHO was "extremely concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction." WHO faced significant criticism of its management of the pandemic, which was considered inadequate, including due to the late declaration of public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative response was supported by a petition urging the Director General of WHO Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the VOCID-19 pandemic.

The experts stressed that each individual had the right to health, including persons with disabilities, belonging to minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are responsible for the economic and social impacts of the crisis of COVID-19.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on political responses in different countries of the world, as well as views and advice.

The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the British minister of the office of the cabinet Michael Gove and the son of the President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for managing the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) were relieved of their duties following their management of quarantine in Central China, a sign of discontent with the response of political leaders to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger over the Coronavirus epidemic.
Some senior Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the coronavirus epidemic would have started in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories arguing that the COVID-19 would have its origins from the United States or Italy.
Donald Trump's U.S. administration called the coron virus "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," stating that in China "censorship has now overpowered a virus that has become a global pandemic," which was then taxed on racism by some opponents and intended "to divert attention from the inability of his administration to contain the disease."
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government outlining the broad lines of a seemingly National Security Council communication strategy, the strategy of which is as follows: "Everything comes from China.
We are being asked to try to communicate this message in all possible ways, including during press conferences and television appearances." Press bodies such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg said that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus were part of a propaganda push to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy leader Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and "generosity policy".
Borrell also stated that "China aggressively insists that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while a priori sending aid to the latter two countries.
The 100,000 masks given by Jack Ma to Cuba were blocked by American sanctions on 3 April.
The US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own country.
Other mask-related conflicts have also been reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, which was affected by the Coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the EU, said that "only China had responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "highly placed political source" which indicated that 80 per cent of Russian aid was "less or less useful for Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive of "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft in charge of medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov said that "by offering his help to his American colleagues, [Poutine] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment have gained speed, they will be able to do the same if necessary."
The magnitude of NATO's "Defender 2020" military exercise planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, NATO's greatest manoeuvre since the end of the cold war, will be reduced.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized Exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of American troops and many participating European countries, but also the lives of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about 20 members of the parliament infected, as well as 15 other old or current political figures.
The President of Iran Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for assistance on 14 March 2020, stating that his country was struggling to combat the epidemic because of lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic generated calls for the United States to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare programme, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after it announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks on government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be indicted for mismanagement of the epidemic by the government or, on the contrary, for its reaction. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree until further order, suspend parliament and elections and punish anyone accused of spreading false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The Coronavirus epidemic has been accused of several cases of supply disruptions, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and a disruption in the operation of factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Agency issued warnings regarding shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and interruption of suppliers.
Several localities have also faced panic purchases that have led to the disappearance of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, rays, leading to shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has warned of delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment was increased by 100.
This demand led to a price increase of up to 20 times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and WHO warns that this will endanger health professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigos to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of children's milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of VOCID-19 in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products that followed, these two areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages that had been foreseen in Europe and North America.
Due to its large agricultural production, Northern Italy did not notice a significant decrease, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
Food rays were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while members of the Chinese government released pig reserves to ensure sufficient livelihood for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy so that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the world economy have been felt in China: according to a media report of 16 March, the Chinese economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales have fallen by 20.5 per cent.

The estimate of an expert from Washington University of Saint-Louis reported an impact of over $300 billion on the global logistics chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would have been "broken" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to declining demand in China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February as a result of a significant increase in the number of cases of VOCID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concern over the coronavirus epidemic, several U.S. stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Warning, have posted their sharpest falls since 2008, with a Dow Jones down to 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign debt rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions fell again due to fears related to the coronavirus, the largest decrease having been observed on 16 March.
Many think that an economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures put in place by central banks and states.
Central banks react faster than they did during the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations against travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe failed.
The impact on the cruise sector has reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year's festivities, and private companies have also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the Lunar New Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, the authorities extended New Year's holidays to 10 February, requiring most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has moved to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has declared an emergency, shutting down schools until March and cancelling its New Year festivities. The distribution sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store opening hours or temporary closures.
Visits to traders in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders saw a decrease of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also led to a drop of 33-43% in pedestrian traffic in commercial centres in March compared to February.
Trade centre operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning frequencies, the installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of customers and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional people in extreme poverty in Latin America compared to a situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak peak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of the 300 million rural migrant workers were blocked at home in internal provinces or stuck in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The Coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Containment in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paying a daily wage) unemployed. The Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44 per cent of Canadian households had experienced a certain type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement imposed in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for a temporary unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies pushed their employees to a partial activity scheme subsidized by the government called Kurzarbeit.
The German part-time work compensation scheme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the functioning of organizations and individuals, both employees and independents, at the global level.
Arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the State) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists to the extent possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions were closed to new order and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed throughout the world and to varying degrees.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of Holy Week in Rome, which took place in the last week of the Christian penance period of Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online, live or television, while others propose to practice their worship as a "drive-in".
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and chapels and the St Peter's Square, which was emptied of all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants to the sacred sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the largest disruption of the world's sport calendar since the Second World War.
The most important sporting events were either cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 Champions League, the 2019-20 England Football Championship, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The epidemic disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were initially scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but no later than summer 2021." Casinos and other gambling facilities worldwide have closed and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has led many players to register online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The world of the show has also been affected, with several music groups having suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many great theatres, such as Broadway, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in place of traditional live performances, such as live and online concerts or online festivals created for artists to produce, broadcast and promote their works.
Online, many Internet memes on the theme of coronavirus have spread because many prefer humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (while the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist sentiments expressed in different groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or received a justifiable punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the inhabitants of areas affected by the virus.
Following the spread of the epidemic to new sensitive countries, Italians, the first European country to experience a serious outbreak of VOCID-19, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens from countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese entry into their country to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan raged on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling the coronavirus "Chinese virus," a term considered by his detractors to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North-East India, who share a border with China, and study in large Indian cities, would have been harassed in connection with the coronavirus epidemic.
The president of the West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took his revenge on them".
The remarks were subsequently condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Kolkata, which calls them "false." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were fuelled by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign waste" that should be "deleted".
Many paid access newspapers removed them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the free access epidemic.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on prepublication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory screening of the 2019 Coronavirus Respiratory Disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods of virus detection and antibody detection produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both population diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibodies tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or asymptomatic people.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests conducted in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect reported lethality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (RTR-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or spectoration sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed from pharyngeal swabs is reliable only during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus can disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected persons tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken in the deep respiratory tract by aspiration catheter, or a cracking (expectation) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charity in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (RTR-PCR), and was the basis of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test on January 23, 2020.South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical quality SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a PCR-CoV-2-SARS detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC) distribute their RT-PCR diagnostic device in real time for the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the old versions of the test kits, one in three genetic tests obtained unconvincing results due to defective reagents, as well as a bottleneck of tests at the Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only at this time that federal and local laboratories were authorized to begin screening.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.The U.S. commercial laboratories began screening in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at the national level of the RT-PCR-based VOCID-19 tests.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed national testing of VOCID-19 on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced. The collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the VOCID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect infection with VOCID-19.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA authorization for a test that could be carried out in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4 128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use permit (U.S.A.) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA U.S.A. for a test taking approximately 45 minutes.
FDA approved a test that uses isothermal amplification technology for nucleic acids instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to step up manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, hoping it can deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes, such as a rapid influenza test.
A literature study in March 2020 concluded that "pulmonary X-rays have low diagnostic value in early stages, while the results of TDM [tomography] can be conclusive even before symptoms occur".
Typical symptoms visible on TDM include multi-lobarian bilateral depoli glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
A subpleural predominance, a "crazy paving" and a consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to TDM in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, several of its imaging results coincide with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommends that "MDL be not used for screening or as a front-line test to diagnose VOCID-19."In March 2020, CDC recommends PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to the infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after symptoms appear, to determine immunity and as part of population monitoring.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLC) or by patient's bedside test (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The automated high-speed systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of performing these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, only one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples may be used to follow the immune response.
For PCT, only one sample of blood is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the Agency and can, therefore, now distribute their antibody testing.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorizations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is much faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after the onset of the infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were effective enough to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan in which suspicious cases can remain at home, "emergency will provide the patient with a sample tube," patients crack inside, return it and later receive the test result.The British NHS has announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspicious cases at home, eliminating the risk that a patient will infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if used.As part of the COVID-19 test drive for suspicious cases, a health care professional will take a sample with appropriate precautions.
The "drive" centres allowed South Korea to carry out one of the fastest and most comprehensive screenings in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Physicians of Compulsory Health Insurance stated on March 2 that it had the capacity to carry out some 12,000 tests per day in outpatient settings, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are covered by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that, on calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested until week 12/2020 included and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of samples from 64 patients at a time, by pooling the samples and only by testing if the combined sample was positive.In Wuhan, an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese: "Uo-Yan" or "Fire Eye" in French) was opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, and can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
Thanks to its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modeling revealed that cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capability.
Wuhan's laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed free models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1 122 samples of patients for VOCID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without robot fluid manipulator.
In March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagent became a bottleneck for mass screening in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation has prompted some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes in order to continue the screening.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now the country that tested most of its population per capita for Coronavirus, and were in the process of intensifying screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were obtained through a combination of the ability to conduct test drives and the purchase of a population-wide high-speed laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this ability to be operational outside China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula to manufacture kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was only published on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations for screening of health specialists.
On the other hand, specialists indicate that the high availability of testing in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The screening capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of screening programmes as a better way to slow down the advance of the VOCID-19 pandemic.The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus led to the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and stockpiles of hatcheries and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects."The government then removed bureaucratic barriers that impeded private testing.Spain purchased test kits from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the erroneous results could be related to the inability to collect samples or to use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it will withdraw the kits that have given erroneous results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80 per cent of the test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic have provided false results. Slovakia has bought in China 1.2 million test kits that have proved to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought in China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them". The UK bought 3.5 million test kits in China, but announced early April 2020 that they were unusable.
The screening, followed by the quarantine of those who achieve a positive result and the tracing of people who have been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, has yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first death linked to the VOCID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Almost half of the people achieving a positive result had no symptoms, and all the cases discovered were quarantined.
With the restriction of commuting, this measure has completely eliminated new infections.
Thanks to aggressive contact tracing, incoming travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much faster than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened on the due date at the end of the holidays on 23 March.
Several other countries also managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with the highest number of tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower lethality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and with limited experience in national laboratories of COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive in % of tests" depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only those admitted to hospital will have a positive value as a percentage of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Handwashing, also called hand hygiene, corresponds to the cleaning of hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key times" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, e.g. diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fecal.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key moments of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing her diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you don't have water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after preparing meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing the diapers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the bathroom;
after it has dried or coughed/sneededed;
after touching an animal, animal feed or waste of animal origin;
Medical hand hygiene refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering drugs or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of handwashing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction of infant mortality during home births.
According to a study conducted in 2013, improved hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as soap-washing.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
The introduction of actions to promote handwashing could reduce episodes of diarrhea by about one third, a figure comparable to that obtained by supplying low-income areas with drinking water.
Washing hands with soap reduces diarrhea episodes by 48% and is the most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs). It is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the leading ARIs, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, accounting for nearly 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia lead to the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing your hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce by almost half the deaths from diarrhea and one-quarter the deaths from acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing is generally associated with other sanitary measures in the framework of the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Handwashing also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive handwashing can lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common in health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilet (mine, defecation), after cleaning a baby's buttocks (or changing its layers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Hands should also be washed properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, especially before and after treating a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing or getting wet, after touching animal waste or handling animals and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of soap hand cleaning is low.
According to a study conducted in 2015 with 54 countries on hand hygiene, an average of 38.7% of households washed their hands with soap. A study conducted in 2014 showed that it was in Saudi Arabia that the rate was highest (97%), the United States was in the middle of a table (77%), and China had the lowest rate (23%). Today, there are several methods for changing behaviours and democratizing the use of soap for handwashing at key times of the day. It is possible, among other things, in developing countries to propose to schoolchildren to wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day so that children make this act a habit.
For example, the Philipinne Ministry of Education has implemented a "Primary Health Care Program" to promote children's health and education.
Deparasitage twice a year, associated with daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate microorganisms present on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleaner for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic soil matter, are difficult to soluble in water.
Adequate water flow, however, facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely as bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also states that "liquid soap vending machines are preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended to people who are concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protector, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid with antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils with dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of warm water does not contribute to reducing microbial load on hands.
A hand disinfectant or an antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic hand hygiene products (currently called hydroalcoholic solutions, hand antiseptic solutions or hand disinfectants) began to become popular.
Most are formulated with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or with a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), and fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of the bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.99% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of the bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application.Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for the hands or hydroalcoholic solution must be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands and the interstices between the fingers and nails should be crossed for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or dry gel.
The tips of the fingers should also be cleaned by rubbing them, palm against palm.The American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid removal activity from microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate handwashing unless you have any soap and water at your fingertips.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or moisturizing agents of the skin.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than washing hands with water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water products do not eliminate organic matter on their hands, but only disinfect them.
That is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for non-alcoholic hands depends heavily on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride had a long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many people do not have the means to buy soap, rather using ash or land.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases rather than stop them.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends proper handwashing to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Moisten hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make any difference).
Sprinkle a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
The soap eliminates the germs of the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse abundantly with running water.
Rinsing in a pond of stagnant water can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and wet hands are more easily recontained.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the underside of the nails.
Artificial nails and scalded nail polish can accommodate microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or soap are not available.For example, pour water from a can or gourd suspended and pierced and/or use ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tippy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging crutch using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is to debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are often found in the toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper and paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and more modern air-jet hand dryers.
After the washing and drying of hands in the hot air dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194 per cent on the pulp of the fingers and 254 per cent on the palms.
Air-jet hand-drying led to an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the pulp of the fingers and up to 77% on the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment according to each drying method.
The air-jet hand dryer, which blows air out of the apparatus at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and the apparatus and possibly contaminating other users of the toilets as well as the toilet environment within a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer allows the diffusion of microorganisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by the TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following changes in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Handwashing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during movement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing in the medical environment became mandatory well after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use led to a decrease in infection rates.
The medical washing of the hands shall last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hands mousse and rub.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a hairbrush to remove them.
Since the germs present in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This helps to avoid retaliating your hands to contact surfaces.
The objective of handwashing in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and to avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that insufficient hand-cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, with a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before reaching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, proper handwashing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure to be followed for washing and rubbing hands in the field of health.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene prepared by the Organization can also be consulted on the website for feedback from Internet users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Devices available in trade can measure and certify hand hygiene if compliance with regulations is proven.
The World Health Organization defines "Five Hand Hygiene Indications" as follows:
after exposure to blood/organic fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
after having had contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap (soap "medicines" or "antimicrobials") gives the hand washing agent an action of destruction of germs.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very widespread. To "float" the hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a valve that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, a chlorhexidine or iodine-based washing product, sterile towels to dry the hands after washing them, a sterile brush to rub and another sterile instrument to clean under the nails.
All jewellery must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
Once the hands are washed, the hands should be dried using sterile linen and a surgical coat should be put on.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for the hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of handwashing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of handwashing beyond 35%.
Comparing handwashing with an ordinary soap with an antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, comparing handwashing with an alcohol-based solution and handwashing with an antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, the first reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce the influenza A virus (H1N1) and the difficult Clostridium spores present on the hands. In order to improve the hygiene of the hands in health care facilities, it is possible, among other things, to train the personnel in handwashing, to make more alcohol-based products available to them and to send them written and verbal reminders on this subject.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, soap-washing is considered a cheap and essential tool for maintaining health and even feeding properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash your hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal habits of hand hygiene.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand-washing stations.
However, low levels of handwashing may also be due to tenacious habits, rather than lack of soap or water.
Promoting soap-washing and awareness-raising activities can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of this practice and lead to long-term behavioural change within the population.
In order to achieve this, follow-up and evaluation activities are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. Regarding the promotion of handwashing in schools, one can cite the example of the UNICEF "Three-Star Approach", which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once the minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to the final three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The World Day of Handwashing is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that aims to promote behavioural change.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
Few studies examined the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries compared to the number of healthy years of life earned (i.e., DALY avoided).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap-washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, especially for vulnerable people such as mothers who had recently given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing care".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the fetid odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, food epidemics and nosocomial infections led the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more actively hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The emergence of swine flu in 2009 and the VOCID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to increased awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand-washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports.
The term "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to take responsibility or to be accomplices to something.
It came from a Bible verse by Matthew in which Ponce Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands compulsively to try to clean up an imaginary spot, a symbol of her bad conscience regarding the crimes she committed and which she encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that some people, after remembering that they had committed acts that were not ethical or considered doing so, tend to wash their hands more often than others and give more value to hand-washing devices.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory "purification" measures, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe handwashing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, which consists of using water and not soap to wash hands, is part of the handwashing rituals highlighted in many religions, including Baha'ism and Hinduism, immersion (vitelah) and ritual ablution of hands (Netilat Yadayim) in Judaism, the washbasin in Christianity and the wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe handwashing for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam demand to wash their hands before and after each meal.
Risk controls for VOCID-19 in the workplace
The workplace risk controls for VOCID-19 mean the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls vary according to workplace and tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs at lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including handwashing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are ill, the respiratory label, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Average-exposure jobs include those requiring frequent or close contact with individuals without suspected or known VOCID-19 but may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and certain high-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in case of encounter with a person with VOCID-19.
OSHA considers health workers and funeral workers exposed to persons with a suspected or known VOCID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, to be at a very high risk if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or samples of persons with a suspected or known VOCID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protective equipment adapted to the task.
The outbreaks of VOCID-19 can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, have to take care of others or fear possible exposure.
Commercial models may change, both with respect to the goods requested and the means to acquire them (including shopping outside peak hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of items from geographical areas severely affected by VOCID-19 may be discontinued. A plan for the preparation and response to infectious diseases may be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account the risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors related to the family and community context and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic diseases.
They also outline the necessary controls to address these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of responding to an epidemic include reducing staff transmission, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls forms a comprehensive framework used in occupational health and safety in order to group risk controls by efficiency.
When the risks of VOCID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on the behaviour of workers, which can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls refer to changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (IPS) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the worker's risk, properly adapted to the needs (e.g., respiratory masks), properly and systematically worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as required, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs at lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
The recommended basic infection prevention measures for all workplaces include frequent and thorough handwashing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, the respiratory label, including covering the mouth and nose for coughing and sneezing, providing handkerchiefs and garbage, preparing for telework or scheduled hours of work, deterring workers from using other workers' tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious people is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in a workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they no longer have fever, signs of fever or any other symptom for at least 24 hours without the use of fevers or other medicines acting on symptoms. They also recommend that flexible sick leave policies be implemented, that employees stay at home to take care of a sick family member and inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at risk of medium exposure include those that require frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1.8 m), people without suspected or known VOCID-19, but can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to a community transmission in progress around the company's headquarters or because the person recently made an international trip to an area with widespread VOCID-19 transmission.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and certain high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of highly effective air filters, increased ventilation rates, physical barriers such as transparent plastic sanitary windows and the installation of a driver window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include the encouragement of sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of meetings in person with virtual communications, the introduction of step-by-step working hours, the interruption of non-essential travel to areas with active COVID-19 epidemics, the development of emergency communication plans, including a forum for workers' concerns, the provision of information and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviours, workers' training against personal access and protection, the provision of personal clothing and protective equipment, the provision of personal clothing, the provision of personal equipment, the provision of personal clothing and the provision of personal protective equipment, and the provision of personal protective equipment, the use of personal equipment, and the use of personal protective equipment.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aeroplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: separating the patient from others by a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to take care of the patient and providing a protective mask to the patient or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when dealing with a sick passenger or touching organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, where possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items shall be disposed of in a bag intended for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces shall be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls shall include the carry-over of the journey in case of illness, as well as self-isolation and immediate information of the on-board medical centre if a fever or other symptoms develop on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolated person's cabin. For schools and childcare facilities, CDCs recommend a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of community spread.
In the event of a minimum to moderate Community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational outings, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical or choir education courses or canteen meals, increasing the space between offices, scheduling arrival and exit hours, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate infirmary for children with influenza symptoms.
In the event of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, an extension of school holidays can be considered. For law enforcement officials who perform daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by CDCs.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact individuals with suspected or confirmed VOCID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulance officers, including the wearing of adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt before reuse using a household wipe or detergent spray and follow standard procedures for containment and disposal of used PPE as well as containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health and funeral workers to belong to high or very high-risk categories of exposure.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to suspected or known VOCID-19 patients.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or samples from patients with suspected or known VOCID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure funeral jobs include workers involved in preparing the bodies of individuals with suspected or known VOCID-19 at the time of death; they move to a very high-risk exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known VOCID-19, including when performing aerosol-producing procedures.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain health and funeral settings.
Samples shall be handled using level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms according to the suspicion of VOCID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for those working less than 6 feet of patients with an infection suspected or known by SARS-CoV-2 and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 filtration respiratory masks approved by NIOSH or above must be used in the context of a complete and written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and better worker comfort. WHO does not recommend combinations, as VOCID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic fluids.
WHO recommends the wearing of a surgical mask only by screening staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take care of or transport VOCID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or a facial screen, a blouse and gloves.
In case of a procedure producing aerosols, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
As the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a room occupied by a COPID-19 patient to persons directly involved in its care, the use of PPE needed for the specific task only, the continued use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of PPE and deterrence of the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Relieving the burden and preparing the future
DATE/WIDE: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE : CC0 : No rights reserved
We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the type of global empathy, cooperation and community-building that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and kindness that we have observed among all our colleagues in emails, calls and instant conversations are a remarkable testimony of the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I could no longer be grateful and proud to have you all among my colleagues.
Last week, someone gave me their gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia right now, and the strong symbol of the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain the operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but also how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make substantial adjustments to the way we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and time jobs
As Robyn mentioned above, the C-team met last night to discuss our approach and time use in the days and months ahead.
During this conversation, we considered what we believe would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
Above all, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to step back, don't worry.
To all staff, subcontractors and contractors:
our daily working time target will be approximately 4 hours per day, 20 hours per week until further notice.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, do shopping or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without saying, but we're saying it.
No sick leave or leave with pay is required: simply notify your supervisor and help your team to review schedules and time schedules to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive at VOCID-19, please inform Bryan of the T&amp;C Ops department to help you and make sure your situation receives the necessary attention from management).
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our subcontractors and our colleagues on schedule.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual working hours under normal conditions.
This applies if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means of evacuating their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior, so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The SRE, Ops HR, Trust &amp; Security and Fundraising teams (among other things) are doing essential work that may require reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess current objectives and focus on supporting core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most indispensable projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to "work twice as hard to catch up on lost time" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to work overtime to meet now unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and will endeavour to establish new objectives and timelines where appropriate.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and to the objectives of daily working time, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, take care of them and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their work schedule reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps upon confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Location, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco might have been exposed to the VOCID-19 virus.
However, in excess of caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital quality antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol that uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return to it.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork facility, which shared with us and all staff members based in Washington DC its VOCID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration according to San Francisco's advice.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a premises in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but could be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who are used to distance work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider allocating them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Video the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchange.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or make a collective note).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your wellness refund for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support the increase in the distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the edit-a-thons, until the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized if these objectives were delayed or changed.
Next week, we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sad in the face of upheaval and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As far as the future is concerned, the CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communication with them.
Stay in touch despite problems related to VOCID-19
We will send an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
By then, you can always find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to the VOCID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and gather all information in the same place.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff members residing in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, significant workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help for anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and ensure liaison if necessary.
For confidential or sensitive questions, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, Director of International Global Operations HR.
None of these changes should be considered a abandonment of our work and obligations.
On the contrary, it is a matter of recognizing that, at present, our work and obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These steps are what we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to provide the world with the service on which everyone can rely.
Our planned work will be there to wait for the time to come.
For now, it is time to help each other and prepare for the important work that will come in weeks and perhaps months to come.
We need each one of you to do this, which is why you must preserve and care for your families in order to be able to give the best of yourself the moment that comes.
Finally, please: wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme related to the external face (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing the Ang (1-7) which makes it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing zinc located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an M2 domain of N-termination peptidase and a C-termination renal amino acid transporting collectrine domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane type I protein, the enzyme active domain of which is exposed to the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is related to the cell membrane mainly of cells of type II lung alveols, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial cells of smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of the ACE2 RNAm is also present in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus and cerebral trunk.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
ACE clives hormone angiotensin I in vasoconstrictive angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn clives phenylamine amino acid at carboxyle end of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also cleave several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghreline.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the source virus of SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the source virus of COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of the S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 to the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of both virus and enzyme into the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the initiation of protein S by host serum protease TMPRSS2, inhibition of the latter is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can contribute to the fight against infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended that standard treatment be continued using both ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 demonstrated that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who have a higher risk of pneumonia, especially those who have experienced stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less evident than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The human recombinant angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (rhACE2) is perceived as an innovative treatment of severe lung lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour effect duration.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people who are intolerant to conventional renin-angiotensin (RAS) inhibitors or for diseases with high circulation of angiotensin II. RhACE2 under infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The VOCID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracing of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of persons ("contacts") that may have come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the Government on certain territories and in certain jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, in particular those based on the mapping of the geographic location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of functionality to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with persons carrying VOCID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local computer community, it has been provided as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth application that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and communicates quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technologies and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracing application was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering implementing applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geo-check application for patients diagnosed with VOCID-19 and resident in Moscow, to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Safety Engineering at Cambridge University, referred to a number of possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and lack of potential effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronovirus" applications, Apple only allows "official" or generally trustworthy organizations to add Coronovirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists raised concerns about the implications of Coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the Coronavirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have set out eight conditions to be met in government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extensions of control and surveillance should include extinguishing clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating VOCID-19;
data security and anonymity should be demonstrably protected;
digital surveillance should ensure that there is no exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
any data sharing with third parties should be defined in law;
protection against abuse and remedies for citizens should be provided for in cases of abuse;
The "significant participation" of all "interesting stakeholders" would be mandatory, including public health experts and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Report ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the persistence of surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism of the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracing.
In Israel, network tracing was approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data have significant potential privacy concerns.
However, all systems based on central servers do not need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system has been used to trace contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking data for mobile devices and card transactions, which they subsequently associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to the use of this information to warn potential contacts, the Government has also made localization information accessible to the public, which was permitted as a result of the profound changes to the laws protecting the confidentiality of information after the outbreak of MERS that affected that country.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized privacy systems.
Details had not yet been provided on 6 April 2020.
The tracing of privacy contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data as of 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy solutions, including using Low Energy Bluetooth (BLE) technology to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preservation Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly named Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leaves the device and that all correspondence is made on the device.
The MIT Media Lab's Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy techniques when collecting and using localization or contact data to monitor the spread of VOCID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technologies originally founded at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive localization and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracing and alerting applications, an essential factor in their adoption by a broad public.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the BlueTrace protocol source code used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative, stating that it would preserve privacy and combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology with a confidential cryptography.
They also published the basic technology specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to allow governments to create official privacy-friendly Coronavirus tracing applications
Direct integration of this feature into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to resolve the problems of adopting the solution and persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system through updates of the operating system and subsequently removing it in the same way after the threat is removed.
The repositioning of a medicinal product (also called reorientation, reprofiling, reassignment or change of therapeutic indication of a medicinal product) means the conversion of a medicinal product approved for a disease or medical condition different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific research axis currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments against VOCID-19.
Other research areas include the development of a vaccine against VOCID-19 and plasma transfusion of convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides the realistic project to develop an effective antiviral drug against the proteins of VOCID-19.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papaine protease, dependent RNA polymerase RNA, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial medicine also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the New York State tests on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24th. On March 28th, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (UAE).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is permitted under the USA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Physicians indicated using this medication "when there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Wider studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a study on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen indicated that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 pneumonia patients, half received favipiravir and the other half received humifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the evidence in support of the medicine is thin and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug in Japan for its reserves and that it would use the army to deliver the drug to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with VOCID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for the Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug can be less effective in serious cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to procreate.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an association of antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded "no benefit was observed".
These drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado are trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would bind with SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for repositioning drugs specially developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
The resuscisor was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and viral infections Marburg. Gilead Sciences then discovered that rescisor had antiviral activity in vitro against several filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
An antiviral treatment problem is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies prior to the trial suggest that resuscisors may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by university hospitals in Cleveland, one involving people with moderate disease and the other on those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing intravenous vitamin C clinical trials for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with VOCID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The State of New York began testing for azithromycin antibiotic on 24 March 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) provides for a clinical trial of Teijin alvesco (ciclesonide), an inhalation corticosteroid used for asthma, for the treatment of presymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme, a Phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from the severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with moderate symptoms of VOCID-19.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who have been diagnosed positive with VOCID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or lactating women who do not have an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which prompts the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study of 300 patients and studying the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, many researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as the MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin has been recommended for treatment of VOCID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Directives
Umifenovir: Humifenovir has been recommended for treatment of VOCID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Directives
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as VOCID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many developmental attempts are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, a virus causing the disease, before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in the phase I safety study.
The VOCID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic was declared worldwide in 2020, generating significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Defined in April, the imperatives of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists indicated that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against VOCID-19.
The main platform targets in Phase I security studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenoviral vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, including 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed in planning or design).
A Phase I-II test conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, controlled against positionbo and performed in several centers, while determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the efficacy of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccine candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human assessment phase (always in "preclinical" research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically alter viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan's International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) announced that it had begun to work on a vaccine, whose human tests were expected to begin in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had begun to work on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen develops an oral vaccine in collaboration with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emerging BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that of neoantigen vaccination used for cancer treatment.
On March 25, the director of the research institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and that they were starting testing.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it had started a vaccine project to create a Ii-Key peptide vaccine against VOCID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St Louis announced its project to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both west of Maryland, announced working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emerging Biosolutions announced its partnership with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners also announced preclinical testing projects and a Phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in accelerated procedure, it would take about a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a Quebec biotechnology company, in Quebec, indicated developing a coronavirus-like particle through the partial funding of Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is being researched in the laboratory, with human tests scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian announced that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "strong sums of money to gain exclusive access to the vaccine against COVID-19", which prompted the German government's protest.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a RNA-based vaccine.
The vaccine candidate based on BNT162 RNAm is currently in preclinical testing phase with the start of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the human test of its final vaccine candidate could begin in autumn.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of US$ 4.9 million in a consortium to seek a vaccine against VOCID-19 including the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in developing a vaccine against VOCID-19 to US$ 29 million.
The other investment partners of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against VOCID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started testing animals for six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifier RNA vaccine against VOCID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days after the sequence was sent by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million C$ for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against VOCID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian societies and universities such as Medico and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $192 million C dedicated to developing a vaccine against VOCID-19 with plans to create a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported testing PittCoVac, a potential vaccine against VOCID-19 in mice, stating that "the subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines administered by micro needles triggered a significant response to specific antigen antibodies [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo pharmacy school announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with cloud-hosted computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia plans to include 4,170 health professionals.
Developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using specific animal models for VOCID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates the need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there are no curative or protective vaccines against SARS that have demonstrated both safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There is no proven vaccine against SRM.
When the MERS spread, it was thought that existing SARS research could serve as a model for developing vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were in progress; all vaccines were viral vector, two adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications have released a conspiracy theory that the virus that caused the VOCID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS's coronavirus.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
While the majority of cases lead to moderate symptoms, some evolve towards viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have healed. The virus spreads mainly during proximity contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Since these droplets are produced at the expiration date, they usually fall to the ground or to surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during subsequent phases of the disease. The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for wearing masks by the general public vary, some authorities do not recommend their use, others recommend their use, and others require their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for VOCID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and a face or blue lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, higher respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal discharge or sore throat can be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in various proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only thoracic pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, failure of several organs, and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The incubation period of VOCID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and under study. Korean disease prevention and control centres (KCDCs) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; out of 166 infections seen today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both expectoration and saliva can carry significant viral loads.
Talking loudly releases more droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore revealed that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not carried by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside the patient chambers produced positive samples at viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may disperse respiratory secretions and thus cause air spread.
Although there are concerns about spread by stools, this risk is perceived to be low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if we do not yet know exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and after four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products degrade the lipid protective layer of the virus, which deactivates and eliminates the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the beginning of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to the Wuhan acute respiratory disease outbreak.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by VOCID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) which is the most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called spicule (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been reported in 12% of patients admitted to Wuhan Hospital, China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be related to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and heart functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with an adverse prognosis. Autopsies of individuals who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for respiratory epithelial cells expressing ACE-2, patients with severe VOCID-19 have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
In particular, GM-CSF secretive T cells have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe lung disease in patients with VOCID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported at the autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, nasal or expectoration sampling may also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours or even up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain from the coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to independently develop chain polymerization reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which could detect active infections and a person's previous infection) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience of the test revealed a precision of only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test at the closest to the patient on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multilobarian bilateral depoli glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are typical symptoms seen at the onset of infection.
Dominance under pleural, crazi paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may occur with disease progression.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of VOCID-19.
The main pathological findings at the autopsy are:
Macroscopic: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, extensive atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRD) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the course of healing: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (IVCD); leuko-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequent washing of hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching of eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Correct hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered with tissue in public places, in order to limit transmission in case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce contact between people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel and cancelling large groups of people.
The distance guidelines also include respect for a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no known drug to be effective in preventing VOCID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 at the earliest, a key element in the management of VOCID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having sucked, coughed, or sneezed.
It also recommends using a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where commercial hand disinfectants are not available, WHO proposes two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is not "an antiseptic active substance for hands".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and support from other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of being carriers of the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal oxygenation by membrane (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analyzed.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet were recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments may be useful for those with moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for VOCID-19.
Reanimate physicians and pneumologists in the United States have collected therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there was no specific treatment for VOCID-19.
Regarding symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen in the front line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in conditions of care when performing procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health professionals who care for individuals with VOCID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an airborne isolation chamber (AIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions. The CDC highlights guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (IPS) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, breathing or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, the focus is on breathing masks (face masks).
The N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency use authorization (U.S.).
They are designed to protect aerial particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or as a last resort, artisanal masks.
The majority of cases of VOCID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with COPID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided by using a high-speed nasal cane or positive pressure of the dual-level respiratory tract.
It is not known whether either one or both generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-speed nasal cane. Serious cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the care system to treat a sudden peak of the number of cases of VOCID-19 severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with VOCID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRD) during VOCID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices with pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are being tested in clinical trials.
The resuscisor seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines may not be developed before 2021, several drugs being tested are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine can be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in trials on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorization to plasma of convalescent persons as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
He has not been subjected to the necessary clinical trials to demonstrate his safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "close contacts" using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend auto-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. Massive data analysis of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data of persons suspected of having coronavirus.
The purpose of the measure was to ensure that quarantine is respected and to protect persons who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German Federal Government Agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile telephone operators that "40% of people continue to move".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called on the world to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People can suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may develop moderately with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as cold.
Moderate cases usually recover in two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe VOCID-19 infection based on similar virus data, such as SARS and MERS, but there is a lack of data for VOCID-19. In some cases, VOCID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, VOCID-19 can rapidly progress towards acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with VOCID-19 include septicaemia, clotting disorders and cardiac, renal and hepatic lesions.
Coagulation disorders, in particular increased prothrombin time, were described in 6% of cases hospitalized with VOCID-19, with renal impairment in 4% of patients in this group.
Approximately 20% to 30% of people with VOCID-19 have a high rate of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples present diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lung resembles an acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest was observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized people had pre-existing conditions, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region may also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The under-reporting of moderate cases may lead to over-assessment of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of VOCID-19 and are at a 2.4-fold higher risk of going to intensive care or dying from non-smokers. Concerns have also emerged regarding the long-term sequelae of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital administration observed a 20% to 30% drop in respiratory capacity in some people cured of the disease, and lung scanners suggest organic lesions.
This can also lead to an intensive post-care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was not known whether an earlier infection had an effective long-term immunity in people cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of people cured of the VOCID-19 were reported following positive tests of the coronavirus at a later date.
These cases are considered to be a worsening of a latent infection rather than a reinfection.
It is thought that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by spreading the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost only led by a man-to-man transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of VOCID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms dates back to December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary by region and time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time since the outbreak began, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, gender and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the CIM-10 U07.1 emergency pathological codes for laboratory-confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for deaths of COVID-19 cases diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death/case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns-Hopkins University, the worldwide death/case ratio is 6.9% (153 822/240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the infectious lethality rate (IRF) that reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited over time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease has spread through festivals, and to young people, generating a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths related to VOCID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people may have antibodies, according to an evaluation of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as related to VOCID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different in both men and women.
Mortality is higher among men in studies in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among 50-year-old men, with the difference between men and women disappearing at only 90 years of age.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The precise reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors may be part of it.
Immunological differences by sex, the lower prevalence of smoking in women, and the development of comorbidities in men, such as lower age hypertension than in women, could have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died from VOCID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data associated with the type of infection with VOCID-19.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health personnel, particularly nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means crown, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), an animal species or a group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing VOCID-19 is called coronovirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in its public communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly referred to as "coronovirus".
During the initial epidemic in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended using the 2019-nCov provisional disease names and 2019-nCOV acute respiratory disease for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the Use of Place in Disease and Virus Names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Given the capacity limitations of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as hatches and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in due course, a local startup designed and printed the 100 valves required in one night.
After the initial outbreak of VOCID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to some other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drug or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against VOCID-19 is currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "SOLIDARITY" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are trying to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response of the human body in the event of a new infection with VOCID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the S-spin protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new vaccine creation technique).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an harmless genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are ongoing.
Seven trials evaluated previously approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials on resuscitating it in several countries with reports due at the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of vaccine and drug candidates for VOCID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of VOCID-19, including resuscisiver, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with interferon beta.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of re-suscisors in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with resuscisor for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some require an independent analysis of the research.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that twice that dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of physicians treating patients with VOCID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or humifenovir against VOCID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for continuation of an in vivo study after demonstrating a low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spiculus protein starting with serum 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have any known role in the treatment of VOCID-19.
Cytokinic shock may be a complication at later stages of severe VOCID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic anti-shock properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
Unrandomised phase 2 tests are being conducted at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Associated with a blood test of serum ferritin to identify cytokinic shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to cause the death of some affected persons.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of refractory cytokine reactivation syndrome with steroids induced by a different cause, treatment with CAR T cells, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence to indicate that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of CRS.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of people who have cured VOCID-19 to people who need it is being studied as a non-vaccinal passive immunization method.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with little conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the mode of action expected by which passive antibody treatment can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of serum of convalescent people, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of patients cured and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
