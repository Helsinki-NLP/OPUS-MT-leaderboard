A Republican strategy to hinder Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth and states that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, the American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in the same vein, a majority of American governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that hindered the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon has spread since the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Accordingly, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during 2011.
New electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, as well as proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the poll and withdraw their right to vote for citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to submit a photo ID.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
Therefore, the Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit a photo ID.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity card with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have a photo ID.
And there's still more.
In many states, students, voters who vote most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to submit such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of scrutiny in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to assist voters who wished to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of some 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators passed laws in five other states that favored the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the voters in the state.
In the case of Hispanics it was exactly the same.
These represent only 11% of voters, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, represent only 46 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
Democratic legislators and their supporters have, of course, strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
In this regard, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The United States Ministry of Public Prosecutions intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states passed the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they intend to influence the results of 2012 in the key states.
A report from the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this regard, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Detection: Do or don't do the test?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents wrong results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is a more than sufficient reason to make men doubt, already reluctant on their own, whether or not detection tests should be carried out.
Doing the test or not?
We've asked two experts for advice.
Studies in the United States found a high rate of contagion among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret such data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years of age, also demonstrated that there are between 30 and 40% potential for metastasis if the screening test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of his or her cancer. He or she must be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not affect life in the long term, in which case he or she should be chosen rather for active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer you treatment.
We increasingly determine precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether or not the test should be done.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society Against Cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesperson André Beaulieu.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced to half.
Weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
The risks of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus are increased.
"Research shows that the regular practice of life-long physical activity protects against breast cancer," they add.
Food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risks of having colorectal cancer.
Charcute products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting may cause the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, for the time being his investigations are not conclusive.
According to CSC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, Mr Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about each other's concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Doing the screening test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs' boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, indeed, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it's not entirely clear that it's Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it is much like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at an important physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there is still more data missing to be completely secure.
Anyway, we assume it's about Higgs, as the chances of being wrong seem few.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break that rule and don't try too hard, because it'll end up hurting itself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, in general, of some of its characteristics.
The physicists classify the particles into two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the beginning of Pauli.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Labs' web page The Particle Adventure which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of which we will not speak here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, I could underline here, are not the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone at a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the bosons "power bearers".
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it, it takes to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were an ice-cold pond in which only a thick rock could slide through the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like the CERN (the great Hadron Collisioner is a ring of 27 km of circumference!) to achieve such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to the door of a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not have it.
What, though, can you "contribute" all these investigations?, asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to examine the differences between observations and predictions of MS.
For their part, many fervently wish that they would find themselves, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that plugs certain holes in the model.
This, we have to say, still has huge shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (another ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Impacts
The impact of such investigations on our day-to-day lives is difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that you will have any.
For you to see: in the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution that their work would provoke.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked in the Bell labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pressed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light catcher in 1969 during his research on optics.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this catcher now serves as an "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That doesn't mean, of course, that LHC activities necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care, the best way to die...
In his Commission to Die in Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed soon as a draft law is prepared.
However, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer he was destroying had given him a two-year breath.
"They had given me five years of life, but I've been like this for seven years," he recounts, made a pass, lying in his bed in the palliative care center Victor-Gadbois de Beloeil, to which he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has caused him damage: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Valiente, even comes to smile, to talk to the unknowns who devote attention to him, bring him medicines and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to cure my diarrhea, it's humiliating," he confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the centre of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he notes.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care centre suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
Mrs. A.'s greatest 89-year-old fear is to die "conscious and drowned."
But the disease has made her children discover.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I have no more desires left in this life," he says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the next few days, a last visit from his son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, because we know that we'll all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The moribund is offered mouth rinses with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetes is no longer controlled by its sugar level.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, your son finished his beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the center Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man who enjoys his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed among his pillows while everyone drinks his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after trying everything to survive.
"Since six months ago, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 with cancer," said Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisacendt center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care problem
Seventy-seven per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of their life, either at home, at the hospital or in a care centre.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the home palliative care society in Greater Montreal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that great relative lack of health care in Quebec that causes many doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by the eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate its opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before he or she agrees to proceed with euthanasia.
"Recently," she says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in E.R. suffering great pains without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die only because they don't get the proper care."
And at the same time, many oncologists obstinate themselves with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard's survival hopes were already low when he left a treatment of exhausting chemotherapy.
"When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting," she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who request death thank their caregivers for not having met their demands once their pain has been alleviated by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at Grand Montréal's home, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his or her death, either sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same: "I want to die".
But that does not necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want to be relieved."
This report has been made possible through a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, BTP entrepreneurs, fund-raisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia count, day after day, what they know about a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafias are part.
A "industry" that was too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is curious how the system is sprayed once we have hunted the great media," he ironized Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former chief of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to an in-depth investigation into the embezzlements linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the Liberal Prime Minister of that moment, Jean Charest, had consented only to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, the clandestine financing of parties and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the ministry of transport would have saved billions of dollars in contracts", containing some of its instincts to keep a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, while hoping to be able to "demonstrate the existing stratagems behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also implemented with its team of government officials, researchers and analysts.
This unit operates in addition to the police officers of the "Marteau squad", who, since 2009, have caused the Montreal "storage cartel" to be moderated in terms of inflating contracts.
Over the past few weeks, the unit has registered allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal offices such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
Repeated bribes are suspected in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers of the Montreal road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambio, have been formally charged.
The latter has caused shock by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambiso distributed money to the right and wrong during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals in power.
It also admitted that it had organized a collection of illegal funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewage contracts
In Montreal, the corruption "system" worked effectively.
Gilles Surpreneur, former public works engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he incurred.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating invoices between 30 and 40 per cent for false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of having deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his pockets with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected policies that made the alarm sound.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to developers in full real estate boom.
70% of the money from election campaigns was dirty money
From the research that will finally be carried out, she assures that she pulls "from a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and fish the culprits".
And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We're cleaning up the wounds, but we'd need a clean investigation unit in Montreal and be very alert so that dubious practices don't happen again.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is concerned above all about the role of the '"elected politicians in the knowledge of the strategism".
Estimating by 70% the proportion of dirty money that was spent on the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, ironically: "I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100 parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "while election expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It calls for a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing the parties: "we cannot fall lower; going to the bottom of things, courageously, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger foundations, with more controls and laws".
If this story blurs the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who would laugh to look in the mirror.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Advance from day to day to his side.
Technical staff have also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
It's all going very fast in football.
But I don't calm down.
From my beginnings in the pre-formation center of INF Clairefontaine to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced to aggravated steps.
He will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me much in terms of my position.
It is supported by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect to all technicians.
Today, there is no one equal in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with great players.
I think he'll take other titles to Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken our leading position.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we've ranked for the eighths in style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
Let's try to get as far away as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
We want, to begin with, to finish the first of our league in front of the port so that we can receive the eighth round of finals.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He's already got the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long term.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the GSP is being given to its means for this project to take place.
Not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
We haven't gotten far in the last season.
In May we took a disappointment, as we had the best conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think he'll be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the guns to take it.
Do you think the media expect more from the PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We've totally accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, who still find themselves with things that reproach us is a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to start a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City that, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for eighths at the end, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the inverted sums, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "impressed" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
The PSG seems entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's successes.
Let's just say we have a Zlatandependence.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he has a lot of goals.
He's here to prove he's League 1 star.
And he's proven on all the teams he's been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What you've done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to make progress.
How did you experience the Eurocopa 2012 with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating gambling time.
I saw things there and got reinforced.
Today I manage to play good games in the selection.
That's what I expected from my baptism with the blues.
We have learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and we must have exemplary behaviour today.
What vision do you have of Didier Deschamps' first month in front of the blues?
He's getting results.
They are well located in the classification group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us for the Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the selection to Brazil.
Did the October 16 tie (1-1) in Spain serve to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
All the contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing burdens between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equal to the same.
Some 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
Bitcoin's contribution, after reaching the top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before today rounding the $10 (the contributions are counted on bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not impressive if we compare it with global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual coins such as "credits", used to advance in a video game and that can be won playing or can be bought (and even occasionally redeem).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and treats the changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both depositories of accounting books, verifiers, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is signed electronically through a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoins changes consist of the public account book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers and the winner, a sort of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file cutting, i.e. transformation of a large file into a shorter and more unique numerical footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "trace" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zeros at first).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, one user would want to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would stay orphaned, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regulars, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to a hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
"The fault used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the potential for money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Insitito in Israel, analyzed the book of accounting and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the "giant discounts" were launched.
"$30,000 has been changed," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogic book on this coin, believes quite in the potential of this technology in addition to the transaction network.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come out cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to start up in shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They simply provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to review hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to impose, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, in the event that this currency is successful.
We've left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished, above all, the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former chief refugees in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks join their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, they will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to the French credits, was done by order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, monitored by the helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a sort of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants surpassed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahidenes, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making them government land to resell them as solars for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
It will be necessary to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is avid with mobile phones. Television and its Turkish leaflets presenting a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with rebuilding the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, by abolishing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country had been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs or major irrigation systems have been fixed.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan had immense mining wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract the iron or copper minerals from the land and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mines, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to excavate the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country on which imports and exports are heavily dependent, will also need to re-establish their normal relations.
French troops left on November 20th.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: schools of girls, schools of children, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win the hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain localities.
These works, which are good at obtaining local labour, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased areas of cultivation.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very harsh in those valleys often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to free themselves from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civil aid and to reach them directly.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever with regard to the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he decided to play the whole game for the whole.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And almost two years ago, Egypt had used an interim text, several times modified, which weakened institutional stability and led to judicial tangles.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic deliriousness" and continues to "treason his word" and "feeling the right".
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that this is a step towards speeding up the institutional and political crisis and accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way of recovering popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy causes havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or they vote my text or I keep the full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist in its vast majority, voted yesterday.
Most Liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt that they could not assert their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be achieved, 11 people, substitute members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As could be expected, the articles voted were unanimously adopted.
The commentators were pleased, on the other hand, that one of the few discrepancies of the day had been expressed practically at the time of the prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the watch of the Constituent was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on late yesterday, consisted of 234 articles.
Article 2, which is the object of all eyes, remains at last identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "rules", which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing more than a publicity trick.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who must confirm its conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are further increased by the fact that the next rector of that university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of marital status.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulimas but university students, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But it recognizes that there may be some ambiguity about article 220, since the terms used imitate religious vocabulary.
"We refer in particular to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could be asked in the future would be to what extent are the competent civil judges to rule above all this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms regarding the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that there are few in comparison to those during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor will the prosecution of civilians in military courts, as called for by human rights associations, be prohibited.
They also showed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be freed.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
Moreover, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president had to go out on television last night, demonstrations were planned for this noon.
The supporters of the Head of State protested on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence on the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal cell" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking over the waters, the appeasement of the storm and the replete networks.
In this same place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But most holy places are found in Jerusalem.
The believers walk here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins in the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretorio, where the trial took place, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgota, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the Anointing and the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place there is also the symbolic Christian Ombly of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will then become reality.
Make a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great commanded to build in the year 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located in mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And getting there by their own means, can only those who engage in climbing.
The others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermón ski resort, where in the winter months there is a great influx of tourists.
From the foot of the hill, bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were supposedly inhabited on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
On a single trip you won't be able to visit them all.
But it's worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Rollos of Qumran, discovered in the caves of the desert of Judea, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In its exhibition of paintings it has canvases of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bath Al Basha, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Cesarea it is worth visiting the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops there.
Entry is free, and donations are definitely not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives ring out.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
Israel's three main tourist areas are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall by 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily hold even those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to go through treatment courses with salt water, brine and curative clays and to strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
It preserves the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
She passed through the famous maritime route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he had a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets that bear the names of the Zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your symbol "myself", fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find couples of newlyweds who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph themselves.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists Remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shekels (currently $1-3,8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly composed of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travelling in any kind of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transhipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night to Saturday sundown, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts its work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of salsas, Falafel, which are balls of ground chickpea, fruits and vegetables.
Streets in Israeli cities do not see street dogs.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats who "walk to their liking" in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The snoring machines love the crowded places and do not reject the candy.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost from 37$ (Hyundai Getz) to 188$ (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Besides the insurance, it comes out for $15 a day.
And the rent of a bicycle will go out for 15 shekels a day.
Museum entrances cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to visit the country and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount exceeding 51% at the same rate as in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
As deputies and human rights defenders discuss the consequences that the law would have on compulsory examination, timulators have already appeared in the country who trade with "false" certificates.
Every year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December a law has entered into force, according to which each immigrant worker must carry out an examination to check his knowledge of the Russian language.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, examinations will be made mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to give the examination of the language, if not also that of Russian history and that of the basis of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even in order to receive and renew the work permit.
The citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language are exceptions.
Persons who obtained their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The Network of Examining Centres will operate under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of People's Friendship, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants can be tested in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 centres of this type are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press this question: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
Firstly, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people who suffer from "labour slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of labour immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must be initiated before their departure.
Only an organised selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of the cases.
Problems are faced by immigrants without a profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, put a "paid trip" to a creepy and narrow cove, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they do not pay the promised wages," confirms the Chief of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Tajikistan Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be mad, boss!
However, in the meantime many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but also in their own language they write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: there are few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, not to mention wearing them, wearing them and buying them what they need for school.
When they reach adolescence, these boys venture to work for the first chance.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as the language law is concerned, defenders of rights point to an important point.
The examinations will only be carried out for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or forbid passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for just a thousand five hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and there are cases of extortion.
"We are being asked for a hundred or two rubles for cigarettes or tea," Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov said to journalists.
"Come on, don't be such a bitch, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was revealed that not only immigration registration documents can be false.
Several "false" certificates of language knowledge have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed in standard color printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is twice as expensive as the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, that government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they would not have been able to pass the exam for the first time more time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian-speaking immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite small
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to the owners of weapons of civil use.
This is the government's reaction to the recent incidents: Pressing shots during wedding celebrations where luckily there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which Pressing seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for licensing to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on possession of weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "sensible certainty" be abandoned.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, commented at the BBC news service of Russia, criminal lawyer Vasily Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, for six months of 2012 142 firearms offences were committed registered in internal organs, compared to the total of 1168 offences registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civil-use weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Providers: from factories to officers
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and in the High Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts orders for weapons
The first, "an army or military investigation," that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the same Caucasians," says Baranets.
The following type of "black weapon" is stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons come on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover the fault," says an ex-military.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sand granite.
"They have now proliferated private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute roped weapons to the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
Many guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological literature and public access data of portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the investigators, come from the armed forces and the security forces.
Half of the weapons in the black market have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons", it is said in the report.
According to investigators, 17 per cent of weapons come from places where armed conflict occurs, 14 per cent of cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5 per cent are "illegal archaeology".
The person who relied on one of the weapons stores, who asked for his last name not to be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a game.
Through an ensign, the supplier buys a unit, e.g. a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"This one takes the gun to the city and sells it at 900 euros per unit with two shippers," he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when we have to comply with the crime discovery plan, they are buying evidence from illegal arms dealers," adds the dependent.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed me to go to the "Begovaya" platform, where there would be a man who would take me to a "squinita" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I found out only there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the shop clerk. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there also has to be arrived, let's say "from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell him that his daughter had fallen a tooth."
I can even get a couple of steel handles through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not going to rat him out.
Novices look for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets tested himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was willing to publish an article on this subject.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there wasn't "everything."
"I felt like I was in a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets's words, is not offered a cat by hare: everything there is can be tested.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where you are offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This does not require any documents or personal encounters.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the ad "Buy a gun or a machine gun."
There users make their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course", asks the user "Iván" (orthography preserved).
"I buy TT. Moscow gun," laconically formulates his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures those who want to buy firearms with two hands.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
Military commentator and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: usually, the website is registered out of the reach of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to let you know where the gun is hidden," says the NGO's press secretary "The Right to Arms", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an order is made online, one is left without a gun and put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures those who want to buy firearms with two hands.
"And people go, as hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can be spent from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
A month and a half should be expected.
It's sent from the military warehouses by middle-ranking chiefs.
According to the Ministry's official statistics, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, representing 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the US are on strike.
Up to a quarter of American teens find their first jobs as cashiers in "McDonald's"
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has been launched in the United States at Walmart Corporation supermarkets and restaurants in popular fast food chains such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will come to the nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and to soften in its early stages.
Protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages received by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the aim of the protest organizers is to create workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." On that day, in the United States, the orgy of discounts that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by confrontations.
On that day, some Walmart Corporation workers, employing 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside trade unions and left-wing activists in the corporation's stores, whose products are aimed at low-income and moderate-income people.
Walmart sells everything, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in your stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the largest supermarkets.
That's why many underpaid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, partly because he pays little to his workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of mounts or hand scanners.
This "Black Friday" the participants of the demonstration demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 per hour, this spending is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary up to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase on consumers' shoulders, every visit to the store will result in only 46 cents more expensive.
In one year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart's supporters are satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" was extended in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight on the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers carried out the "Black Fridays" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post, that they left their job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had only been "another public relations trick," organized by the workers' union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the objectives were not precisely the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city have no appreciation, and that is why for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and then they don't even give you the sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York City.
No one wins less than they do in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers went through the McDonalds and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, even though they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to eat with.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks of fast food be started paying at least $15 an hour, i.e. that their current minimum wage be doubled.
They also demanded that workers' unions be established in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this right and punishing the activists of the trade union movement with harassment and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main factors is the excessive turnover of staff.
Disagreements
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, in which several local democrat politicians participated, in particular the City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says he's selling billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received the support of other prominent New York Democrats, for example the candidate for mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support workers in the fast food sector to achieve fair wages and the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves."
As described in the New York Times, this has been the biggest manifestation of this kind in American fast food history.
But in it only a few hundred people participated, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people in New York worked.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy"
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, has recently been perceived with normality mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual Google conference it demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, it was known that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it was diluted that for the scientists of that company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted to the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of your research group's study?
- We dedicate ourselves to the interaction person-computer, but we also try to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the work stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else is there for us in the future?
- Although Kinect has led the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not yet very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design.
The world must be freed from computing to ours, to the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, fuck those silly virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you cannot be considered a panacea, it remains pending to resolve the question of privacy, as it is not always desired that others learn about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet recording the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, e.g. gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this soda can?
You'll talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- I mean, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we will have to work mainly on designing new types of sensors that can accurately determine the person's reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good in-depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do you lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, the present generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps speed.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in depth.
From this latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
I mean, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on Z.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, of our lab in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects man-machine interaction.
It would be very useful to me for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that I do not require contact so that the tables per second are more.
- And you don't need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared transmitter and the second the signal receiver reflected.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible diaphragm.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the camera location curvature and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transmutable" when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smartphone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in that is your strength (private things only you can see them), but also your weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also for any mere mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile answer!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh burst in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth one might as well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangibleity to these "images in the air." For example, interference with several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a similar feeling to what you feel if someone was blowing it in the yolks of your fingers, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what he looks like he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is hidden another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe he goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as giant balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, we still have to work for many years.
That's what makes work attractive to researchers with virtual reality, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Personal taste subjective instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, to the avant-garde of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of the art and scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from above, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds wherever they show up.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosopheric accountants from St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg's vanguardism in the late 1980s - early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the smiling inhabitants and raises the mood of all.
Recently, he took in his hands an organillo and became the organillerus of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, because of his Bohemia existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you going around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, red is a commitment between the artist, image creators and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little gray provokes aggressiveness and agitation of ungood properties.
But my provocations are meant to initiate a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists from the new wave, with the later ones who were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I went into the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
And all this came together at your Art Clinic, and it was important for me to meet in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to gather.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical art club, a bohemian club, the bohemian house of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Names, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought the project to "Van Gogh's ear".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wearing tight pants, among them was currently the fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the time of Hali-galivskih.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There went our employees and regular customers.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was done in the press, the prize was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little worship.
- There's something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the current and the occurrence.
I'm going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in clowns."
The clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and terrifying.
But in the clowns everything gets drunk and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothes.
Now one is being followed by clothes, orienting himself on the outside, but not inside the person.
And maybe that person shouldn't be given a hand, but spit in his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change your clothes.
- We saw you recently in the role of urban organillero.
Who better than me to be!
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
People used to be grouped together in herds, bohemians wanted one thing, simplones, others.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to like everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to hear Stas Mikhailov come for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned, there's the sex-social sphere.
And to a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything fades.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to lose what you've achieved.
When he was young he made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end up.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money only to paint paintings.
I am in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: an official of culture.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When kings were the right ones everything was otherwise, kings might not understand culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow now there are very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a higher level who properly evaluate these and open their way.
Now the subjective personal taste is flourishing.
The same thing Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you, St. Petersburg?
St Petersburg is not a cultural capital. There is much more culture in Moscow, there is ground.
But over our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural terrain and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people going to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Give birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a murderous asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board leave in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is asked: How to continue the species in terms of pregnancy or on the same spare planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the chief investigator of the State Astronomic Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The reproductive problems in space with the flora began to be addressed.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out with plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit differed in nothing from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, drosophiles.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to the space to check how the embryo develops under conditions of pregnancy.
We get as a result a normal chick.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this kid has to find support, he has to stay on his own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they couldn't find support, the chicks turned randomly.
And after 10 hours in newborns, there was a total atrophy of instincts.
The chicks didn't react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we got the chicks born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," comments Vladimir Sychev on the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological miniarch flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 the experiments will continue.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" will only travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot carry out their sexual instincts.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for 50 years now.
The biggest risk was that of Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that mankind has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it's after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," says the veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of space flight, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are counted to whom after long flights everything has worked out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even on orbital flights," summarizes the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The cosmonaut preparation centre's hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
Under conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates pregnancy.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable, though still hostile, environment for a newborn child is its birthplace.
Small amphibian men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the time of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
"This is very little to forget," says Marina Aksenova, newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, gravitation is necessary for women, the force of gravity.
In pregnancy, the abdominal and pelvis muscles decrease very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we missed that, trusting in the act of birth-stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, it will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sensation of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear in a special training suit, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead us to bring to Earth a disabled person, a totally unfit person," said the head of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships turn to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Head of NKU: The inspection of the system "švarc" has not given with the guilty politician
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is poor.
This is what Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Office of Supreme Control (NKU) says in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This, in my opinion, is what we lack," this describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the SDG (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with inspectors. So is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has an obligation to carry out such controls nor demand obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee at the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the common project between the Czech and German teams, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
It is a parallel control that we began to carry out about two years ago.
Simplifiedly speaking, European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, following the legislation in force in each country and then applying it in itself.
We have joined everything and, although the control has not yet finished, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "more strict and more complete", however, concrete praxis in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate ever stricter rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think the conclusions are?
Precisely a common control of this kind could help us to stop investing efforts in the implementation of laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of savings means getting an appropriate thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not because of the fact that we're reducing the tendering limit, it means that we're going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork" that those who want to look for faults in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits remained as high as now.
You talk about our country's problems with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized differently?
As for the offices, like the NKU, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a school as well, the only thing is that in your case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve parallelly.
The powers are also to some extent analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of account are even at this level. In this aspect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds here.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled in the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would generally not like to draw up a comparison without specific data, but Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be accurately explained what is best.
Could it be better, for example, with regard to the quality of inspectors?
That's for sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make these kind of comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it weren't, it wouldn't be beneficial for you to work with our office, would it?
With regard to our country's legislation, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean to your Office? Is it in any way manifest its impact?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been stated in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex post controls, there is a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new tool of "non-economic risk detection", which we have put in place almost 14,000 public tenders, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified and similar.
Do you consider the adoption of this law to be beneficial, or rather, a hindrance to the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that regulations "harden up" and that it is impossible to comply with them.
Under previous regulations, controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the Regional Council), and each law not respected in the area of public procurement meant a breach of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to harden the law this way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal decision, which has no impact on decision-making.
A system of this kind will only be able to create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how does he get out of this?
We'll see where this started road leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDG would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be regulated in some way, and if it prohibits anything, then even the Prime Minister of the Government cannot prevent the Office from acting, which is under an obligation to carry out such controls and to demand obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say we'll do anything.
In the Public Procurement Act, the rules are quite strict as to how to act formally, and that is how it should be in order to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded from meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This, in my opinion, is what we lack.
Roads have ice plates, although most are passable
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are passable, caution must be extreme in some.
Karlovy Vary region
Today in the morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but they had ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will fluctuate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is thin.
On the other hand, in the crests of the Metal Mountains, snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the regional road operations control centre.
The R6 rapid track and the first-class road in the region are now unrestricted.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be frozen and slippery.
Also, all second and third category roads, including mountain roads, can be transited.
However, in some of them there are still sections with ice and snow debris.
Attention needs to be increased on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in Eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frosting and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the tracks, reports on its pages the Roads and Highways Directorate.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice plates forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice cream can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ustí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on the second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the mountains from Krkonoše to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of snow apsonated in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemia area, the sky will today be between clear and partially cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually fluctuate between three low zero and a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region can be transited this morning, although caution must be increased and adaptation to time will be necessary.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees under zero.
After the snow and the subsequent fall in temperatures, some tracks could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will find themselves in fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is the result of the information provided by the road operations control centre in the region.
The D5 motorway is passable almost without restrictions, although it is recommended to extreme caution, especially on the road between the kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most of the first category roads is dry and without ice.
In the area of the road of Pilsen and Tachov border with Germany there may be sections with ice plates.
The second and third categories are wet, so in this case, you also notice sections with ice plates.
Drivers should be more prudent, especially in the less-traveled routes in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will find themselves with partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road operators took off the snow during the night; on the Šumper road they accumulated about three centimeters of snow, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most of the routes are unrestricted.
"In the highest areas of the Šumper road, remains of snow remain.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will meet with half-waste snow in the direction of Jeseník", confirmed today an operator of the administration of roads from Šumper to the ČTK.
On the ground and at night they also came to the Jesenicka and, after the chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the tracks are unrestricted, on the Šternberská road the drivers should drive with caution in the forest sections, where the tracks are still humid.
Region of Ustí nad Labem and region of Liberec
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported on complications in different sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or iced, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures remain low, even in the lower areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road. Instead, in the lower areas, especially in the south-east of the central Czech massif, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
There have been no service complications due to the memento.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
From the general roads, unfavourable conditions have been announced on I/13 road, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the track with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarmist news that we like to grab.
The Tap Tap music group likes to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
Also, in December you organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state charity we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar stated for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The previous day, on December 20 at 9 p.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time that the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea come up with?
Initially it was my idea, then we went forging the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is titled "End of the World, cancelled".
Today it is very popular on YouTube, will it be possible to hear at the charity concerts?
Of course it will, and it will be just the last, well, whenever everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All the performers will sing it at the same time at the three concerts.
The hymns will link together simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the video, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charitable events and concerts...
We are committed to participating in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and have fun working with us.
To what will the money collected at the concerts against the end of the world be used?
To equipment for the educational centre without barriers Studeo, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkýv ústav.
Students at Jedličkýv ustav school regularly receive visits from teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers, and we make an effort to make it possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkýv ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert, several groups and interpreters perform.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratedsphere with Dan Barrta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will act.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar "spectacular action" planned in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the festival Pražské jaro, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself, personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of persons with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as hard as it can look at first sight.
There are five electric wheelchair members, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which keeps me surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we've just returned from, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the departures abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you found yourselves with so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it is not often that a person moves alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil association has been established that strives to thematicize the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what areas should we take an example of more developed countries?
There are many aspects in which we go behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people to whom it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal that people with a serious disability move on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to take an active part in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes for eminent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers to change everything really.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look at a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I went as an educator to Jedličkýv ustav, where I had many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator says, there's Angelovič, we left a little bit of hands (Laughter).
However, popularity has not reached these last few years, or am I wrong?
It's true that it helped us a lot by connecting with famous singers and also working actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen, is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something else can be done.
The world of show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it is not just a step forward for them, but for society as a whole.
Did you help the fact that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe to you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria abandons them quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap Group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already in early 1998?
Only one: Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever has will and will will will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena of Prague, in Brno Fleda and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected at the end of the evening via video conferencing to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap Tap "End of the World, cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrier-free educational centre in Jedličkýv ústav in Prague, whose cost amounts to 25 million Czech kroner.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry in the pre-sale option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At last week's meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second member of ESA of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during subsequent years participated in the agency's project commission.
However, Poland's path to the cosmos began long before.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. Šternfeld's conference at Warsaw's astronomical observatory in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Award for his "Introduction to the Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a major driver of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name on one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Already in 1925 a drain was built in Poland, which was to be supplied with a rocket engine.
Regrettably, the author of the proposal is unknown and the details of the project are not known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the dresin or for its braking.
The information about this dresina is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 Polish artillery began to engage in missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the material preserved, it is evident that the investigation reached the stage of the practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpedoe powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile technology projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problemmy refers for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronomicals.
One of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of the same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He served this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM probe rocket (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was released for the first time on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had a height of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 aerial tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets were initiated in the Błędów desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was to be the subject of a real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built in 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The highest peak in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km height.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined in the research of cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court suspended the law on social work.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic and less regulatory competition.
Consequently, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to do so "provides a decrease" in the price of the competitor with the aim of making it with most of the market and thus increasing its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where labour prices, compared to other economies, are higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, by doing so, is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
This whole situation encourages the total disinterest of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and compensate for the economic and social damage that they have caused in their desire to gain benefits.
The situation is universally known that there is no need to submit specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations in certain economies in which the Governments of these countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own people without taking into account social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes in existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictation of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees to work rights.
The result is growing poverty along with the widening gap between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot afford their own work.
The number of people receiving this kind of help is already at one million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed with such low wages that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of auxiliary employees in the German federal parliament was made public.
The savings measures of virtually all the states in the south of the EU lead, without a doubt, to the same situation. People, under pressure from an abyssal decline of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live badly on the edge of society, hoping that one day they will arrive in the private investor capital country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty goes from one country to another or never arrives, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a small part of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media affirm until the satiety that the state should not bring capital to the economy, that leading the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by interfering in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence with its selfishness the political march and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case the answer is clearly affirmative.
The test is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, in mutual favours, in legislation that is practically reprobable everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, are responsible for drafting bills to private legal enterprises, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is later passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation such as the one described by Appiános in his work The crisis of the Roman Republic in the times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had long been disintegrated and the administrations were busy with force".
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unimpededly and people went to the polls with the pulverized vote beforehand"... "there were no people in character who aspired to a post in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "He began to seriously speak of the fact that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appiános thought of Pompeii, Caesar went up to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way as in ancient times, is that the present society is based on disregarded preferences of individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is unable, in essence, to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as that of then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite, without any effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The real demolishing fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the Public Procurement Act is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at international and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The lab of chaos.
"That noting comes from violence and noting ever could" (Nothing emerges from violence and nothing could do so), Sting in his song Fragile and whose stribillo reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (Let's not forget how fragile we are).
"If my children did not want wars, there would be no" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged as usual.
One, on the Israeli side, argues in favour of the right to self-defence and encasing Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports Palestinians and claims racism by the State of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and marks Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the massacres that are repeated regularly and who is the victim. Ultimately, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to find out who takes advantage of the tensions that have been dragging for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have come to on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, on who or what group of people is the main driving force behind the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of power struggles is in the front row.
At each time we can find a Great Alexander or Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or whether behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions towards a particular objective.
We must accept that we live in a time that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this implies, it has not been possible to arrive in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don't know, but I don't rule it out): the Rothschilds.
You don't write much near them.
Of course.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have important stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the Iraq attack there were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi there were only four left, but Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Rothschild Bank of America central bank, began during the Secession War to print money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the EDF for unleashing the great economic crisis of 1929.
His desire for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, decorated with grade 33.
The first war marked the goal of eliminating the great monarchic states throughout Europe; the second one wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third one intended to reduce the earth's population between half a million and a billion people (a similar number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a preliminary draft for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method by which the group of the richest families operates, together with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of the crisis triggering and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. Otherwise, just remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis such as that of 1907 could not be repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo, and after the outbreak of World War I, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended suddenly and unjustifiedly from a military and economic point of view, Germany's capitulation (the wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
To prepare the ground for World War II, bankers and politicians were allowed to create, in a covert way, a conflictual situation following the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thus creating the optimal conditions for radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, they were able to serve the German solution of the Führer, which was strong enough and simple and pointed to the culprits, and then build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that had to represent and represented so well the role of the fifth column, which caught the flame and caused the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks were taking place on both sides.
The Second World War broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope to which international bankers had tied him at first or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way in which the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus for a third war was created.
If international bankers were able to start it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the front line of combat, now along with the Arab population or, generally, Muslim of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also internationally. Let us take as an example how Israel's sympathizers and detractors are cut off.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where injustice engenders injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of all there was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz, where 20% of all world oil passes (the corridor of navigation is only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light now are the words David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-accommodated financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls his whole being.
"And it forces all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on the right hand or on the forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand: whoever has two fingers in front, adds the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six."
Argo Movie: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group from the Islamist student demonstration occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration the situation did not offer any positive perspective: throwing the Shah over the edge could not be allowed, since, if it did, it jeopardized the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of hostages in Iran, where revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later intensified even further with the failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The diplomats imprisoned were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian government.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and cheering against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in front of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The director and actor Ben Affleck's film "Argo" themes an episode of this story, which sew a little success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated peril, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, to help a covert story an extravagant point: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team examining the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction superproduction.
Gender combination
The plan drawn up by the "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the cinema project in specialized journals, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines the moods. On the one hand we find well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits, emblematic photographs of the era of events are shown, which were similarly depicted in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And in addition, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: brought men who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the hallways of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Goodbye Little, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film in which the action doesn't take place in Boston City, where it grew up.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran turns out to be in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the taking of the embassy is impressive because of its synoptic ability that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of the disconcerting and the lack of prediction that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the imposter team in Tehran's bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And he does it pretty well. Sometimes he adds something to reality: here everything doesn't come out so elegantly (the scene where the crisis is stalking at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search behind his track become madness).
Argo's weakness is the discontrol that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserve more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a little dramatic trace, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, evaluate its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it collapses, that'll be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services may be, it is sufficient.
Rules for balloon, banana and circus inflation
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey of the most absurd banking rates, has now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent quota of women in leadership positions in large European companies," said Právo Patrik Nacher, the survey organiser.
Among the absurdities appointed is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women have been at a higher price in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Another incredible idea of the EU workshop can be proposed by people by the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of life-long mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline obscures the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to a considerable increase in egg prices this year.
The factual prohibition of using the term "untar butter" or the removal of the classic light bulb from the shops has been criticized.
A quality banana must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus makes such decisions often under pressure from one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the highest quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "abnormal curves".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that this only seeks to harmonize the national rules which have not been homogenised to date, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of food.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU's prescription last year that in inflatable balloons that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years of age are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The U.S. referred here to an American study that, when talking about toys, balloons are the main cause of infant death by asphyxiation.
A similar restriction on the use of matasugras by children up to the age of 14 is also in force.
Curious events are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation on European officials: anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia. In order not to hurt Greece's sensitivity, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Leave Fare, appointed in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume established for preserved mushrooms, which posed a threat of substantial fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the grant application.
This kind of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation," said then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued this with the fact that a lot of cereal was produced in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was prepared to assist the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereal from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended to draft applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The directives of the Member States are often the target of criticism, the EU's regulatory efforts and also more effective operation and development throughout the Union, according to several experts, deserve our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but that Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also affected by the sensitive fibre, just like other countries in the Union, the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always emerged victorious from these fists.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of Olomouc's requisition, but had to change its name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and became called "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate may be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with the feta and gorgonzola cheeses known all over the world, the Mazapan of the German city Lübeck or the ham of Parma, are already found for example the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the tent of Pohořelice and Třeboń and, even, the variety of hops of Žatec.
As EU protected marshes, you can be proud of the Pardubice gingerbread and the Hořice v Podkrkonoší barges.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how did you come up with the president's election?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If it were all right in our country, then I wouldn't submit my candidacy.
But I can't stand to see how it's stolen in the last 20 years in our country, how thieves get away with it, tax increases and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I'm already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon thereafter it has set itself on its way to the presidency.
You're not turning your back on those people who voted for you?
I always said my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
I later specified that if I was elected senator, I would present my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That's why I need as much influence as possible and the strongest mandate as possible.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize at the bar or in front of television, but we trample on anyone who wants to start a change.
This is complemented by the media, which discredit you and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
From me it is said that I bribed journalists or that I was an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It presents itself to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property over twenty million.
To do so, it must change the law.
As president he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a lobbying group for the guideship to be recognized as self-employed, and we have done so.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, either from the right or from the left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary groups.
Without any boxing or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is he considered rather a man of the right or of the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more lefty.
It doesn't matter to me, either a little left or a little right.
What I care about is that we move on.
I don't care if someone's right or left, I want to join people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the SDG and, in the same way, I will be against the bad ideas.
He's joking when you're told he's a populist.
But you're not demonstrating it with what you're saying?
When a business plan is created for the company, you also have certain objectives and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of already work in the world or known experts talk about them.
But without the support of parliament, he only has slogans left.
And with this he cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you talk to people and talk to them, you will, for example, get a criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors of the state.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character pointing to disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Let us take, on a case-by-case basis, the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I say I'm just an amateur, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies.
I just started in politics and I'm trying to get as much support as I can for my program.
I'm trying to get things going myself, but in case it doesn't go well, I'll leave it in six years and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura's going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I don't do anything with a person, so I've visited a number of known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to run their candidacy for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I have supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the frauds with light heating oils.
I introduced myself from the base that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two from the independent sector.
People chose the senate, so it will be complicated to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the unspeakable past of every potential member of the party, nor have I got money.
I don't have any money for the presidency campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about property statements, how's yours?
I value my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot valued at 25 million, a flat valued at 10 million, another flat rated at 8 million, a collection of works of art worth 10 million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at a million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youth dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evils and injustices.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don't have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to owe myself?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that there's not too much interest in my program.
And I don't have the obligation to pay the campaign with money in my pocket.
The campaign costs essentially cover what I will receive as a senator's salary.
But I couldn't live from it. For example, I couldn't afford my son the English school, which costs 30,000 kroner a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run for a candidate.
So you're going to go on with your business so you can live?
Didn't you say before you left this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I have partly left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in spring.
People would want me to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I keep winning.
If I were president, then I'd quit business.

The architecture study MVRDV shows that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the newly finished "book pile"- 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and finally there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is beautiful".
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one gets into those old-fashioned libraries for pleasure, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town located at the gates of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, has the dubious honor of having stood up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges represented on euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that's how the political leaders decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings as well as cynics, took the theme with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury watched perplexed around him and shrugged his shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Estimated fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain rises in the planned location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and townhouse buildings.
In early November, the book mountain was awarded the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town without history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather sense a central milk mill, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it's a book paradise under a cheese.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountain massif, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of its climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the brick floor and the elegant headlights unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you look up, you can see the banks of the park, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books, and more books.
"Normally book shelves are arranged along the façade and in the center there is a huge dark room that is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we've done is put the classic spatial configuration up and take out the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserve the black shelves that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, the touch and the smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers more a day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that's how one day, on a frisian farm, we encounter the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years now, in the greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of scarce millimeters of thickness has been used as a basis for holding the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library, this fabric was taken, for the first time in such quantities, until it obtained plates of four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a new car mix and sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous road of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but also you can enjoy some tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant environment at the same time that maintains the air humidity suitable for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although it is hard to believe it given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is situated under a huge pyramid of crystal, even on sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden fences located across the glass facade serve to give shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is a thing of automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptic worker in the Information Technologies sector, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Also, Chinese traditional medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has shut down deep.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than an empty medium library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows his book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to adorn.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved quite a success in that discipline reigns which in the specialized argot is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
No matter how young and unbelieving it may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a more prominent role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in US-Europe relations, this places Berlin in a rather dangerous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer status for the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I don't think he supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about establishing a flight ban zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is currently reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes it even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they're still taunting what their role will be, but they've already started the path towards a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, stands ready to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers, and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason it must be careful and not alienate itself from Arab public opinion or from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn't give it that much importance because it's not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by refraining from voting in important decisions such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic break-up as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has managed to gain some respect for this.
After all, all of this has done nothing but show that it is a country to which they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the US has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of American domestic policy.
I believe that Obama's government secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the real disparity of opinion does not really have the extent to which it is attributed.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher body, but they must push things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a pelagic subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or is it still difficult for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always a bit uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as the main actor, certain anti-German feelings are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Given this, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the US on European policy is diminishing more and more, but the EU does not at the moment cover that vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if it's unpleasant to them or if it makes them an even more unpopular town, it's life!

"brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name is hidden a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection until the real eponyms present a claim.
And even then it is not clear that they will be given reason.
"Foreigners are becoming increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing's law firm specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case arrives at my table.
Impersonators simply add a couple of letters to be able to record their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the manufacturer of Puma sports items.
Pattloch opens an archive where he keeps seats from Beijing's brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. On the charge of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
Chinese authorities don't feel guilty
"It's harmful to the business, we have to fight it," says Pattloch.
"The brand makes water, the monopoly position disappears and the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millionaire, especially in the case of luxury flagship products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year China is, in size, the third market for luxury goods and the one that grows at the highest rate.
However, achieving the annulment of dubious registrations in trademark registration is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Processes can last for up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long since the name in question had already become a "market reality".
"If the plaintiff is in bad luck, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged his brand in China," says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the manufacturer of Sany construction machinery, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German manufacturer of Putzmeister concrete pumps.
That's why today the Chinese can still use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that largely reminded BMW; the case was settled in the courts and Geely had to change it.
Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the situation of work emergency returned to normal".
Thus, the amount of unprocessed claims has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain outstanding.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, as the trademark office points out.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been paid for rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting a Chinese imitator in court.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the imitator has managed to secure Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have provoked this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO branding office also dismissed the use of the muniques.
In the following two instances Freudenberg has been given reason, but the opposing side continues to fight today.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where it is still pending resolution.
Wentzler hopes to be able to resolve the matter favourably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review files up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite side a "six-digit sum in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was not successful.
"This shows how much we care," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
specifically if imitators are guaranteed there rights over unprotected marks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group had long abandoned this commercial area, but had been able to prevent registration.
"We must be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend to German companies to be extremely prudent in doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what needs to be done is to "record also in China all that can be protected", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the subject can be much more expensive than just a record.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license fees for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: dancing, singing, helping
In Heidelberg try the Imbongi choir and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The history of a link capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (contalt, bass, tenor and soprano) begin to rise slowly, groaning, numbing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his quarters almost by trying to put order with his energetic and soft gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers, aged between 23 and 69, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a hardly known foreign language: the zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations AIDS Programme, around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found in Germany godparents for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover the school registration, the uniform and guarantee you a hot meal per day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in zulu "narrator of stories" or "panegirist".
No one in this room can speak this Bantu language fluently, but sing if they do.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometers of straight line distance from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying with just over thirty years has become something common.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this small town, but what they saw above all was many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally occupied with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the STDs of bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common STDs of viral origin are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Lads and sarna are found among STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected people?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more often found in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the basis that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany originate in sexual contact between men.
For heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, tricomones, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (hungo) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were registered.
This is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urination discomfort, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one be protected?
Condoms may reduce the risk of contagion, but they do not offer protection to one hundred per cent.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend that they undergo regular medical examinations, especially if a sexual partner is frequently changed.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for their performances throughout Germany, they come to raise a lot of money.
"In total we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the Zodwa Dlamini village itself a woman who is self-confident and with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
She is working to ensure that orphans find a good place to stay, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogogos", as referred to as older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in charge, offer them a roof to live in and take care that children go to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chickens and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, has managed to have many of the people tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the obvious fact that this disease is throughout the country, it is not usually openly spoken of.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and overcrowded lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This form of life not officially accepted is largely responsible for the rapid spread that has experienced the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless timers that travel the country from one side to another and take it where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get condoms for free, but these are barely used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact."
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years in southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many at the southernmost end of the African continent still remember from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to tear a couple of tears from someone else's angry border soldier.
The journey always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small population barely appears on the maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is well known.
"Come near Esitjeni, there shines the light," says the locals.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms on Bergheimer Street filled with singers marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see your light shining from there.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice in Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Probably the ice cap has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also iced water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has been formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shade.
It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
Water is presumably derived from comets or, most likely, asteroids that in their day clashed against Mercury.
No one relates the ice finding to the possibility of life on the planet, says the chief investigator of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Fully unannounced for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots such as the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the older stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the newly born stars.
This region of star formation, not romantically named by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This tornado image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pleyades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object at simple sight in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can appreciate the colors better.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation of Aquarius.
His similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned him the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.
This star in cernes could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It's probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Remolino Galaxy.
Depending on the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the Southern European Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since some dark lines of dust divide the burning heart of this star formation zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco astronomers were able to photograph the clues of a cosmic carambole: 400 million light years from the Earth the nuclei of two fusion-prone galaxies leap towards each other to end up clashing irreparably.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname of Southern Molinillo.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula located at 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and a hundred times smaller than the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located at 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a model moment for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the group of brightest young stars in our Milky Way.
This area of star formation constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars are also continually emerging; 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found mainly hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
This allows to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescope Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capability is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) you can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors his name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or Extremely Large European Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018, it is not expected to be able to take images.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a diameter of mirror of thirty meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes to us from the hand of the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched into space on an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers are based on the fact that there is also ice in the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable evidence, as the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north pole.
For decades radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first that orbits around Mercury, scientists are now certain that it is.
Drinking butter daily and living 168 years

A footprint search in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour of the Talysh mountain region could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus progresses with great strept through the winding road that passes alongside woody hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it's in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a town that is not known much, apart from the fact that they perfectly dominate the Persian and the Azeri and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts an architecture perhaps too massive designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit entirely into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists hardly get to this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban nuclei, it takes eight hours because the road is of one sense.
The amazing wealth enjoyed by the country by the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May for the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
This is the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis from the place who have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son of his died at the age of 136
However, the museum's indisputable star is the sheep shepherd Sirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we consider that the documented older man lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive a daughter at the age of 136.
Did you then make a mistake at her age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; especially when there is no civil record.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azeri tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause resides in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich diet of talyshi, who worship meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, be so healthy.
Or maybe it's the natural way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97 he is relatively young for what is stretched out by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, he tirelessly moves a huge bowl of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and daughter, both of whom became grandparents long ago.
They also play from one side to another two young children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea that serves in typical glasses with abhormated shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief hides two long braids of dark blond hair that your son discovers proudly.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so I've never fallen and kept its color.
"I've never used a shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced in his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never been shopping for a supermarket in my entire life.
Then tell us about your husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything returned to its path when the "Dear Father," Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan, the cult that professes to the paternal figure of the nation, which directs its country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when the witness handed over to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) for monthly pension, a amount with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's canous son is right: "in our culture the elderly are very respected".
They live in a great family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the term "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Manifestations that rival each other in Cairo reveal the tremendous division in which the country is plunged.
The future constitution, with sharia as a basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare in pathetic.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that that happens is my responsibility, to the people and to God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially to Christian Coptics, Liberals, Illustrated Muslims and seculars.
All of them, who have been left without a remedy so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily nullify the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his "to be able to save the revolution".
However, neither Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose adoption has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrisome.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What does that mean, "principles"?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation, and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal maneuver that it brings together, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a new article suggests: in all issues relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great power in all Sunni Islam.
It does not have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the incapacity of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts served to exert harsh repression over the opposition.
Following the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As stated in the draft, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
This is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that, with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, this is nothing but censorship.
Indeed, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, another prohibits offending or slandering Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offence is and how it is to be punished.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that prohibits "offensive to people"
Is it enough for the president's cartoon or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been closing ranks in front of the superiority of Islamists for weeks.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at Tahrir Square in Cario and swore to make the Act fail before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who takes third place on the list of presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be "in the bucket of history's garbage."
Through Twitter he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "state coup against democracy".
"When he convenes the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow him," says oppositioner Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiated", quoted in the Egyptian media the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to supervise the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Quran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community made an appeal to celebrate a counter-demonstration; in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in the cry: "The people demand the application of divine law."
They demanded Mursi "clean the country", while proclaiming: "The Quran is our constitution".
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi's supporters did not want to risk something like this happening.
The Muslim brothers stated that both those opposed to the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would have come the time to let the people decide in the polls which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamist draft has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear in the new constitution," laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Mursi's powers to the three powers of the State made this lawyer resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of democratic play and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protestor at Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster you cannot control."
Norwegian Rakfisk: The world's busiest fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success has any connection with its greed for a highly oily fish?
Take a series of excessively cured cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
Then you can smell the paralyzing aroma of Rakfisk, one of Norway's exquisites.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salad trout that is fermented in water for a period of time, depending on how bad you prefer it, up to a year.
As it gets darker and colder, the Norwegians go to a festival that is held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this eating of the most, so to speak, captivating.
"It eats raw and then drinks an aquavit glass of a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also what is known as the "General of Rakfisk", who organizes the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking from a drink important quantities of the drink.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink can kill the smell.
I'll try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it's not bad; it's not very different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty struck Norway and where, before refrigeration, the fish was stored during the fall submerged in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it comes out and, obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and even makes not too much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, an essential part, albeit rather ill-fouling, of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you the fridge of 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it to be so.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of July 22".
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's present wealth, one of the world's largest oil and gas industries has grown since the early 1970s.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, as she goes through rakfisk trays and that, with her long blonde apple and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn't have during the years preceding the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
"While we can ski in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk", adds with an unwrapped carcass.
I'm in the snow doing queue to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now an elk burger is definitely something different and quite juicy to taste.
But at night, it's that stinking fish back.
The hotel I'm staying at is one of many places where a rakfisk dinner is held where the diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nose pits most.
A television has connected live with a presenter who wears straw and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
Looks like the Eurovision competition.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There's laughter and applause.
A man falls out of the chair, maybe beaten by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto Faces a Hard Start · Global Voices
As the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant analyses the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad today.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and that is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their place of work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the nation's management.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is plunged into a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Mr. Peña Nieto earlier this week to US President Barack Obama at the Oval Dispatch.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Prior to coded with the president of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his native state, Mexico.
A very populated state with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; The opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, you are reminded with affection.
Its residents give it the credit for the growth of tourism on site and for the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive along one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and filled roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with its name at the entrance to a modern sports sport and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he can make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, MP of the party of Mr Peña Nieto, the PRI.
"In particular, in terms of security and economy, we look forward to the interesting and true change that our country so much needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was disbanded by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The MP Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition's lack of essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic statesman and, above all, he's a person who knows how to listen."
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the crowded streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high highway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, military intervention was called for to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, at best, that he was unable to address the problem of femicide while in office.
The most critical accuses his administration of making a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the damaged neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I got to her house, it looked like they cleaned her body," recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."
While his mother recounts the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, next to a cross on which a single word is read: Justice.
However, that's exactly what the family says he's been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old gossip, a rioter, a complaint.
What they want is for one simply to accept what they say and to shut up."
"But that cannot be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico for the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office.
"I hope it's the same kind of president that it was when I was governor," says PRI Olvera's deputy in Bravo Valley.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, according to prosecutors
Prosecutors try to deal with Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse while in prison
The trial focuses on Manning's period at Quantum Military Prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning's incarceration was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest leak of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now claims to have suffered while in military detention.
During the interrogation that the prosecution conducted to Manning in a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that the records of the weekly visits of officers of the unit Manning received for nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence's request that the case be dismissed since his imprisonment had been harsh and had already meant sufficient punishment, arrived one day after Manning had testified that he had thought about suicide while in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks posted the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In Friday's view, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the officers filled out after the visits to Manning during his arrest at the Quantico military prison, where he was imprisoned in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning questions and written down his answers.
When Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning recognized that he had qualified the treatment given to him by the censors as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the visiting officers had spoken to him about those problems and had indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they did not record those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after talking about problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean that I wouldn't have mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Denise Lind Army, also asked Manning why she had not reported the treatment she received during the January 2011 meeting with a council to examine the suicide intentions she had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime under which he was under.
The military said that they had placed him under this restrictive regime, which is below the level of surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure their protection and safety for others.
"I wanted the older state to know that I was okay and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... so I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness due to heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Aafjon, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning stated that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a blouse, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming from outside pointing to his eyes while sleeping.
He said that if the censors couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so he could turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed in January 2011 a formal complaint about Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation she had made in her Thursday statement that, after being forced to sleep naked in her Quantico cell, she was forced during a morning count to remain barefoot in front of the jailers and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said that he deduced from the order given to him by the jailer that he had to drop the blanket with which he could have covered, but recognized that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning stated that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his chanclas to self-injure himself but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night they had removed from their cell their underwear, their chancles and their glasses.
His lawyers were hopeful that the judge would at least take into account the experiences he had spent while in prison and drastically reduce his sentence in case he was convicted on the war council, which was expected to begin early next year.
The defence stated that it intends to cause Manning to plead guilty to minor crimes and to defend other allegations considered too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was held in accordance with the rules of application to any detainee in maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawfully provoke the publication of information on the Internet, leaking information from the national defense and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely come down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and was already completely confused.
Some posters indicated the way to two tails: one for "Mexicans" and the other for "Extranjeros".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I was supposed to go.
Having grown up in Central California, I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
It's ethnic tachygraphy, just as my Boston friends refer to themselves as "Irish" or my New York friends call themselves "Italian".
Later I decided "Mexico-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, tachographs or scripts were not necessary.
He was just American.
I speak Spanish. I speak Spanish well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the foreigner's tail.
I thought about that moment this week when Mexico's elected president, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always as the leaders of these two countries gather, it consisted of immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also looking forward to talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment a Mexican is so likely to stay in Mexico as to venture to go to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of grudge.
Probably most Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of its territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So, at the moment when a U.S. official says anything that carries the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Moctezuma stand in war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a whole challenge is that which they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking grudge?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or any of the grandparents, who was locked in the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a particular profile: dark skin, a low level of study, coming from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And, even though we may now be living the American dream, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican one.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and they look at us over the shoulder as if we were from a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn't be trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that there is this rock between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter it bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered to be part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to further complicate things, so I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised Mexican ambassadors, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American comrades how fantastic it is to visit that country and pressure the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much grudge.
And, with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us aren't so sure it's a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna be alone with this idea, folks.
It's fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resented for how their family members were treated a lot less time ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the futile and usual discussions about who started first, many buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has left it all torn whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional turmoil.
Maybe this will make your fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their lethal standstill situation could disembark.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November is maintained, this week's clashes have reinforced the hawks on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza under pressure in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its ruthless rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could conclude that time plays in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renaissant regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf, has also done so.
The exulting Hamas members say that the half-Islamic moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbulah militia party dominates, passing through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas' allies are threatening the king.
Above all in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populated and fundamental of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas brothers' cousins and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist to which it cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel's hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in place.
Israel's anti-missile system Iron dome has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more calmly... for some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for having begun the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, partly thanks to the barrier that runs across the West Bank, the main piece of an aspiring territory to become a state of Palestine, and it protects the Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite the fact that, according to international law, they are illegal.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even tougher line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why spoil those Palestinian torments by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets like their fellow countrymen in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing is imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good wish and could mark the start of something.
Israelis should also think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder that one day will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, the same way that this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as the Arab population increases.
The cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one that calls for sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and Israel's transfer of territory for security reasons.
Hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire gives a little more impetus to the others who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to curb the entry of weapons into Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the issue should also press Hamas and Fatah to unite.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Again in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to devote its attention to it.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.

Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases appear on boxes of a green off color, which are the same for all brands of tobacco
Australia's law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colours of the brands with an envelope of an olive-green blackout, horrific images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of sick children and babies as children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the various images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small font type.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia states that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamorous.
Trusts in studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% chances of never smoking.
"You can see that children, even from an early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco, Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that will be brought by counterfeiters from China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Other people say their business has benefited after the passing of the law.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, stated that the demand for pickles and silicone covers to cover the unpleasant pictures of the boxes had been shot almost from scratch two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a denial of the law at the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was expecting more stocks.
"It's a good business for us."
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertising on television and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has begun to take place online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
"If you sell tobacco and you only have this small window left to promote your products, online space is the most convincing place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in reviews of brands from "footed citizens" published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders whether it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or whether any marketing company is behind it all.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what new regulation implies than on marketing.
Industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are asserting before the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering implementing similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the mandatory inclusion of images in the boxes.
They are now compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
Many smokers in Australia are challenging.
"Photos don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them."
"Take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Surely, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking, because of my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in central Sydney, indicates that uniform boxes make it more difficult for him to place them in shelves.
"It usually took an hour to unpack a delivery; now it takes four," Yu says.
"The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, it's, okay, it's over and we shut down the store," he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get a little bored
During this year's Thanksgiving parties, unexpectedly I had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying in suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is rather boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops.
But there are more and more scholars and experts in child development who praise the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it is good that, both we and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Aborting forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in good spirits?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The boredom, an animated story") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
"In fact, the story of boredom is very extensive," he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about boredom dating back to the 1st century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a variety of ways," says John D. Eastwood, Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and putting the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "desiring, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you".
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person doesn't do anything but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly."
boredom can sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider it to be the problem they have.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what happens to us is that we have problems concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September edition of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person who read the article of a journal.
Some groups listened in the adjoining room to a television program with all volumes that had no relation, others listened to it with the low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, altered attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective parts in a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored."
"In fact, we now know that moving or squeaking, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help to fight it, as they make that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to be quiet," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale of tendency to boredom".
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at West Florida University, says that, using these scales, researchers have discovered that boys are more likely to get bored than girls, and specifically need more external and varied stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a kind of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which 400 adolescents and their parents were contacted seven to eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers said he was bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said he was bored when he was not in school.
On the other hand, 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he did know was that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest levels," largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: Is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as gambling or falling into substance consumption as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way the brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to play guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you see television, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So if your son is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to dose himself," says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dose applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need to get more bored, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing to relate it to something that is worth it," he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it's hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado: No Book of Instructions for the New Marijuana Consumption Act
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community college and footballer in Southeast Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe that he used to smoke.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and a time later Orozco received a judicial summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor crimes each involving a fine of $100) informing him of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," says Orozco.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado on the legalization of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of smaller causes for drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor marijuana possession offences are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have ceased to press charges against those over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be passed legally once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the most conservative district prosecutors in Colorado have committed themselves to moving forward with cases opened for marijuana possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent newly authorized marijuana shops from opening up in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the matter around.
And they continue to seek advice on establishing a system of licences for production, manufacture, distribution and sale, all of which before the deadline comes on 1 December 2013.
They say that, for good or for bad, Colorado goes ahead of most states in regulating the use of marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so he will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what could work.
"There is no real precedent that serves as a model," he says.
The Washington Act, known as I-502, comes into force on 6 December, leaving also a year during which it will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to provide "adequate access" to licensed marijuana and its prohibition of carrying out cannabis businesses on a radius of less than 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Centre for Legal Cannabis, a recently created research group.
On 21 November, Oates, Aurora's chief of police, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would stop bringing lawsuits for minor misdemeanours for possession of marijuana to persons over the age of 21 and that the police would stop filing charges against those crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said that they would be responsible for enforcing the regulations of the city that regulate marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stronger view.
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers and to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those offences that occurred at the time they occurred were a crime," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer quotes adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district prosecutor, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases for possession.
"I don't think she's wasting her time keeping law enforcement until it changes," she said.
Although 55 per cent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
"It's a cultural barrier with district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents those accused of possession of marijuana and who is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of the Marijuana Law.
"They've spent so much time bringing people to court that, in fact, they still can't accept that it's legal," he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become national testing cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal sales border, they also look forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still provides for consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana are hopeful that the Department of Justice will give in.
Although there have been some notable arrests of patients and marijuana sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales for these purposes to exist in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
"Although drug agents are likely not to throw doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will likely be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores to sell marijuana for recreational use, permitted under the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an Obama administration's drug policy ex-assesser.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will be around a year before any one of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying for what the community voted against voting for what the state voted for."
Many questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I got kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory"
You don't attack college students from their point of view just now.
I don't remember any moment in my life when I haven't been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, after two weeks of occupying my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the history career, I had already packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were disconcerted.
The Evening Standard stated that I had left because I did not tolerate some college colleagues having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced jokingly that I had left because I was forced to drink in unspoiled cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I ran away, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
They harassed me for one reason only, which in the cradle of the so-called illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they're wondering what that's about now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-wing students are suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative party students is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (a group of graduate students) at Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as unthankful people" for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on their college's equal opportunity committee to make sure they can express their opinions freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" on student politics, which presented the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
He showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Party Association of Oxford University (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a stick with silver handle.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish Head" by introducing higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, 20 years old and vice president of the Conservation Party Association of Nottingham University, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of leftists in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other."
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student in Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, states that this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, a 19-year-old and elected president of the OUCA, affirms that the attitude of JCR members towards people who are from the right center has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, she was an extremely shy 18-year-old.
The hatred for the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honoris causa" after cuts in the funding of Higher Education.
The atmosphere would have shocked any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students know and know the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I discovered that not only did the professors take a big look at the mold that was made of conservative university students, but they took part in it willingly.
The policy of the strike of miners, the privatization and the opposition of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the wooden halls of the seminar.
The first I attended was to translate French texts from the 18th century into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I didn't say one.
Pitt, a low-end man with a face that looked like bizcocho dough, knew how to get rid of bad bile.
"Is it that the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they simply fools?" he asked.
The other college students laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt grunted.
I went back to my room like a feathered soul.
That night I sat alone at dinner in college; then I felt a slight slap on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he kindly said.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They mess with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories seem to be laborists."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardly to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" one asked.
"They beat each other, don't they?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who would think like me only after dark?
Would you have to make me a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years I was expected were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History destined for my college.
They hated him for being not only of the Conservative party, but also advisor to Thatcher in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was barely there.
He hated the place he considered him provincial and insignificant and his adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a Chair at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said.
I began to travel daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding shelter in my most open metropolitan family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he saddenedly said.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
I'd break my heart if you left it."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had insinuated, speaking totally seriously, that I was a "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "stupid old men."
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my university career in Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked.
I was trapped in fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak crying.
But no person aged 18 should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only trained 14 prime ministers of the Conservative party, but, to this day, is hiding behind a reputation that is not deserved by equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentine prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer clients
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentine: Master of Sewing", a retrospective apotheosic that brings together more than 130 high-sewing dresses created by his "house" for the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the colophon of a story whose only protagonist is "the gentleman" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always felt fascination with the far-fetched world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until next March 3, abound private letters and photos with the signature of the most garnet of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social promotion: from humble modesty of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to idol of the international jet-set.
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
"At least they don't turn off the collars on your gorgeous carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities do," said Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and maintains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to your chalet in Gstaad," explains ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charism of the fashionist.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything looked and felt its spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and dear," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the Paris High-Costure Week in 1995.
"It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art," he says.
Alcurnia parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-recorded love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre-long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the walkway to contemplate a "heart" of dream that looks at Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the wardrobe that Monica Vitti used in "La Notte", or a wool and skin coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this mannequin audience, names such as the one in Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sofia de Habsburg are highlighted.
Naty Abascal and the Modesto, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty," adds the former duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and they are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Gioppaola d'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting to be the age and opportunity to wear one of his night suits...
The time finally arrived at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine's dress to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with skirts of fliers, "corsage" draped and carved word of honor.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her fashion party dresses with "the utmost care... because a dress is not just a dress, it's also the set of memories she carries."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding costume at her wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "gagazze" (as the fashion designer calls his seamstresses) to make that ivory silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different lace types and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone in the high seam of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Stuck for years with the elite's "knowledge-being", Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest-ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of her clients' husbands.
"I have always been alert to its refinement, its calmness, its pristine and perfect appearance," admits D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was impeccable, time does not pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The hardest job in the world: Kawah Ijen's human mules
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is a hell and another who literally works in hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make their lives by taking sulphur out of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, you have to go down every day to the bottom of your crater, where the sulfurous gas that emanates from the Earth's bowels is solidified when you come into contact with the air.
After tearing off large sulphur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, carry them in two bamboo baskets that carry over their shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to ascend to the tortoise step, keeping the balance and trembling their steps in order not to slip and fall by the cliff.
They know that any trepee could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who took the risk of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euro for each kilo of sulphur they extract
Once up, they open up among tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, fatiguedly loading the heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has located a little below, at 1,850 meters high.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating since 1960 the volcano and, never better said, its workers, paid 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) for each kilo of sulphur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is generalized in everyday life and is used to make matches, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As usual it is to carry 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily doors.
It takes three hours for each one and ends up grinding, but they allow him to gather 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such an inhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would gain in the field.
"The newspaper of the miners is very high here, where the collection of coffee is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)", the carrier explains, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the size was not as hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a people close to the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, is as sharp as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to become Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing the skin on the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to pay his bill despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
It has asthma, it breathes with difficulty, it coughs constantly and its eyes are irritated by toxic gases that fire the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
Wounded by life, this nice and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cabin with other carriers, it rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop manning at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater lighting himself with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself bought with his money.
About 400 carriers carry the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its small profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs or supply any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and so much weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) charged per camera that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for the beasts and not for the people," protestes Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been in the Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving school.
Capable of raising up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will endure working "all he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and listens to the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and catches the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains about suffering from serious diseases... beyond, of course, their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, knee pains and sores on their shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Swinging the basket over his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his companions start 15 tons of sulfur to the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat's path between the bush.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims opening his mouth well, where he lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the elderly, aged 30, also works carrying sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest jobs in the world: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore Seeks Babies to Save the Economy
Singaporeans blame race, stress and the cost of property and education for having no children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of a mint pill ad, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (bollo) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, holds the hope that with the ad they get to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to keep people "their national duty."
This is purely internet stuff, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was an issue we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing quick dating evenings (speed-dating).
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do as creatively as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one that doesn't take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, state-of-the-art city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2 - known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Ms. Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, said that she was due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increased singleness and delayed marriage and birth, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aims to dramatically increase immigration in order to deal with the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia abounds barely disguised against many new immigrants, in particular Chinese, who criticize for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest fees and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company EL Developers, says that their "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers, who were previously put to the test if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed.
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking with Singaporeans working in the centre's financial district seems not to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it," says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But for me it's important to have my own money and time," says another young man of about 20.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private off-line is private on-line
Privacy.
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary it is about the quality of private or "the sphere of private life that is entitled to protect from any interference".
What's private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply to your daily life and social networks?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed to ventilating situations on the Internet that you probably wouldn't share offline?
The newspaper interviewed five boys aged between ten and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine," on the personal level, and "in the user's key and name," when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets wouldn't raise them to a post," says ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone," she says.
In FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I'm also having fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who's making the ridiculous," he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked persons, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're answering me, I'm just bringing them up," he adds.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
There is no doubt in reply that he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even pay attention to someone who recommended a stranger.
Joseph's 14-year-old case is different.
The teen has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, the latter admits not knowing 20 of the people added to their friends list.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for the address of his home or his phone number.
"If they pressed me or demanded it simply the sacks of my account," he admits.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A acquaintance of a friend of mine was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was," he says.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
"He just gave her privacy."
Then explain a series of steps to configure the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I fell ill or I wanted to.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents it should be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means to seek information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game," he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a master's degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He comments that the issue is complex, "because we are asking you to have a definite criterion on what is appropriate or not to disseminate, publish or say to an age that maturity does not give for that."
"They are also selective when what they care about most is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to," he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to publish a picture of you like the one you published of a friend?
You know what the others publish about you?
When you label holiday photos, did you ask other people for permission to label them?
And one more, do everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act on line as they do off line.
They're the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential for parents to read the policies of social networks to their conscience.
By understanding each of the paragraphs they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "do not talk to strangers".
Finalize Unasur Summit without making public the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant presidents.
Efe repeatedly attempted to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources of Chancellery and Presidency pointed out at an early stage that they would deliver it after the closure, but later stated that it would be posted on the Peruvian Government's website.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists ' access to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day only the soundless video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, but not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more data.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is the pronouncement of Humala, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South American Arab Summit (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being strongly demanded by the press, neither was the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced disseminated.
On the official website of ASPA it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities worked to ensure that there were secure transmission systems for all journalists, but to the maximum extent limited the availability of information.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a decision of the Court of The Hague that addresses a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will act and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today," Humala said, along with his Chilean pair.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will be submitted to the ICJ took place after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact for which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the inattentiveness of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 following the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will give "significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for what we are expanding the residency agreements".
It reported that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, access to low-priced internet in all corners of South America, and to address the risks of natural disasters jointly and efficiently".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and glimpse a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although it did not give more details.
The outcome document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reincorporation to the Union of South American Nations", which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, Colombia's President, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting he hoped to meet with his partner from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute in a respectful way after a failure of the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow day (Saturday) you may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope I can tell him that we are handling this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay make up UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, declared to the state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
In that regard, he defended the plan to establish South American citizenship that encouraged the Unasur member countries.
"We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who give the Chair never commit themselves to anything, and instead we South Americans sign it all.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," said in reference to Ecuador's political asylum given to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa stated that he is not sorry for this decision because he has not betrayed its principles, but has respected its "deep democratic and human rights values".
He added that, at the time, "there were substantial suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his process would not be respected."
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding that he be interrogated on his territory for an alleged sexual offence when "Swedish legislation itself allows it to be carried out by videoconference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that she had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
What there is is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate because you are locked up in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
"That complicates the health of anyone," he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by granting a safe conduct that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is doing a number of procedures in different European bodies," he said.
And he thought, "if Britain gives the safe conduct tomorrow, it's over."
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, questions Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or questions him via Skype tomorrow this problem will end.
Correa used to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists in terms of profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he welcomed the fact that it is no longer these journalists " neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and advanced that if they are re-elected "they will deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and the coup against legality" because it actually "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy."
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
That failure is not being complied with at the moment.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be processed in a comprehensive way to overcome them and move on.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the maritime boundary dispute that they maintain in the same court Peru and Chile and thought that "it is right for Latin America to seek international bodies if the two countries undertake to accept judgment as hard as it may be".
Referring to the eventuality of being a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he sees that possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa assured that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will withdraw from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador's, that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that reponsibility," he said.
To win would be my last term in the presidency and then we came out of public life.
If we lose the same thing.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan vice president Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that he waited for the campaign to go back to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: positive AIDS.
"It was like I dropped a bomb," he says when he remembered the time of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "softer," without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; with such an effort that he had already celebrated his birthday 43.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), to which it arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut."
So, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of his illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" his immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG head of HIV Unit Jaime Andrade Villanueva, noting that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of involvement in the immune system presented by patients when they started the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that those who receive positive HIV diagnosis at the age of 25, under these terms "while remaining in control will be able to live without problems until the age of 75", the interviewee explained.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS dropped from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 per cent of the patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths until May this year; however, it is ensured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happened in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had enough of the medication the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He gave a strong data: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and therefore have to offer massive screening tests to all people who require it."
In his proposal, specialists and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to take the test to a particular laboratory, only motivated because he had made it a friend and, despite his short age, was already in a stage of AIDS and even suffered sarcoma from Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die now, I'd better turn around three times a week," they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, feed me well, exercise, take the medications.
To date, her parents only know she suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"Work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but responsible, I take care of myself and the other person," Fabrizio said, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the context of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let the test be done, if they were at risk, let the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the slogan of battle against AIDS this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Major gaps exist between the health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tapatio journalist who has taken on the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packets of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that some today, still, do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with sormae and value judgments from social workers, school counselors, pharmacies and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to expose themselves, the communicator assured.
He proposed reorienting this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not just behind the counters and those hundred are in public bath dispatchers of the sites frequented by young people.
It's not motivating promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying for the kelas and motel, as Governor Emilio González said, when he asked if there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration.
"So it's not sexuality, it's best to approach condoms to those who already engage in sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV as for a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a U.S. Court of Appeal a judgment that ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario places a negative precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures downstream of the survival of the signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
On the practical ground, the hindrance to the ruling issued on 15 June last by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Banarrotas for the northern district of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties in allende el Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the commercial competition in Mexico.
The first point would involve not knowing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Trade Law was created, placing the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompanies vote, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial contest the debts that the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their parent, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Mexican Commercial, whose inter-company debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The truth is, moreover, that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the creditors of Vitro who fought against him in the U.S. Courts, that is the funds "buitre" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The data is omitted by the Appeals Tribunal.
From another angle, this blames Vitro for the difficult situation that he faced since 2008 in the wake of the serious economic crisis that the United States faced, taking the collection to the country.
The signature of the Gonzalez Sada family will soon bring an appeal for reconsideration before the appeals court itself so that the vote will reach its full session, i.e. the five judges, since they voted only three.
If this does not succeed, the appeal of Cerciorera will be sought, which requires the review of the case by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The serious thing about the case is that the court ruled out a document sent by the Mexican government under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Competition Act, noting that the latter was dislodged with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to tie it with chapter 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambola: they hit Vitro and they hit the country.
General balance
Over several months, the complaints lodged at the table by Mexican Aviation Unions against the ex-domestic of the company, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, have already found the bottleneck.
The body headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal suit against the National Banking and Securities Commission accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the trust F/589 of Bank IXE, on behalf of Mexican Aviation, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
They're looking for the Dragon Mart.
Meeting on the weekend in a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal center of sale and distribution facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products of the country of the wall, with an area of housing to lime for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeast area to oppose the monumental thing that destroyed with part of protected areas and poses the mother of all the amagos against the industry.
ACTA died
Sulayed by the government a demand from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-falsification Trade Agreement, known for his acronyms in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility of considering it to be a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term Homex
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, Homex housing developer is placing on the market Certificates Bursatiles for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identical ones that offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Competitive Birth
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders in information technology, a consortium with a competitive social reason has just been created, whose goal will be the service market of the software clusters of Central and South America.

Hector "Hetin" Kings: "The basketball has been my life"
Trotamundos of basketball Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years tied to the sport of the board and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as wide as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it's just that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sport for over 60 years, he was as a minor grade player, a National Superior Basketball player, a BSN leader with the Bayamón Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I put many hats on basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball was my life."
Kings do not exaggerate by making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his wide trajectory, so they testify.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all, those who treasure with the greatest emotion are those who commemorate their passage through the Vacheros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years as a co-author or a franchisee.
"These were my best years, the ones that I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight cowboy championships since 1967, either as a takeover, co-op or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships running from 1971 to 1975.
And then I fired one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at the BSN.
From then on he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had led here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a very strong 6"7" stature player.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended to sniper Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring in another.
The championship of the Vacheros with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at a distance, since by 1988 it was already part of a more federative mandarin.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his executory and those of Mincy on the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the 1989 Preolimpic in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth, and it must have been bronze not to be for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Cup team the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a fur to the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the world.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90's due to an injury to the knee.
A team that may not be the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the Preolimpic of 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Snows, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner in place of the players suspended by the trouble of the Panamericano de Mar del Plata, we won gold against all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt that was Piculin Ortiz.
Their numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And that without counting his trajectory in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Boricua leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
It had been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and at the beginning of the 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What was left to do to you?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, that Ponce's boys only played in their area and only faced teams from other corners of the island in national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsive certifications and course for leaders, desk officers and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
All I do is listen to music, watch videos of my time music on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a businessman without scruples, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., home producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again representing the iconic role he liked best," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a hospital in Dallas, said her advertiser, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
He was creative, generous, fun, funny, loving and talented, and I'll miss him so much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995 he was found with a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
She played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when she finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included papers well received by the critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his ultimate stardom.
The dramatic series of CBS on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risky in gambling houses.
It also helped to give the series a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and turned it into "Dallas" in the second most seen entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. embarrassed her and then threatened to slap her as a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), hospitalized.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiation he's lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday as someone "great, inside and outside the screen".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
He had already finished recording five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in progress, the chain reported.
Immediately there was no pronouncement of Warner or TNT on how the series will handle the loss of Hagman.
From Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He proved luck in the theatre stages of New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I put nothing there that I thought I was going to hurt someone or affect them somehow," she told Associate Press at that time.
After liver transplantation he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet them when they come for their surgeries, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they'll be fine."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Begin course exploring the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when Professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Maya Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clinged as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what he was expecting in the next couple of months: The hurricane cataclysmic Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "debate" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end of time believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has been," Charmé said this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If you analyze what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that evil is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with examples of real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to deliver a course, entitled "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always have the option of giving the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the same night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"He was saturated in two hours," Restall said about his high-average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still a place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of the Psychology and Nursing career, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - let alone a teacher - said he believed in the expiry date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Maya prophecy and in a way we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a senior student in Temple, 21 years old and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an upsurge in these speculations.
"On other sides people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, implying an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years many days of the final judgment have been spoken, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start thinking immediately on the next date" or philosophy that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they're planning to go to "end of the world" parties.
"Maybe he calls some friends to laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
