Barack Obama will be the fourth American President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth American President of history.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will receive them, inter alia, for the exceptional effort to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have a lot to do.
First, visit to the Nobel Institute, where for the first time you will meet the five members of the committee who, in October, elected you from 172 people to 33 organizations.
Then, the presidential couple has a meeting with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to receive it, although the third one to receive it in his office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the prize, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this subject, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased even more with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which he did not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish kroner (approximately 24 million Czech kroner).
It is proposed to give them charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During his full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which they will attend, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he didn't deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of the nature accused of blackmail
The police of Litoměřice accused the president of the civic association Společnost ochrancě přírody Litoměřice (Society of defenders of the nature Litoměřice).
Last year he appealed several times against certain construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals demanded money from investors for his own benefit, said the spokesman of the police of Litoměřice Alena Romová.
The president of the Society of Nature Defenders Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and is facing a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like containers too much to separate the garbage.
In Prague, citizens can separate packages of drinks and in the villages of southern Moravia can find containers to separate garbage everywhere.
And in Brno?
There it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that in Brno there's nothing to separate the garbage.
It seems to me that, in order to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of garbage, not only because we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, throwing a bottle of PET in the center to the right container?
It's almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found so far is in Moravské náměstí Square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Don't get mad at me, Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
It is not necessary to mention that elsewhere it is not easy to separate the garbage.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
♪ For wandering ♪
What happens is the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw away several bottles of glass and plastic.
But on Kauniova Street, I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing from the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extraliga, which shames us throughout the republic, and not to buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after surfing the Internet a bit, with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM society, Brno is really the worst in the whole Jihomoravský kraj region.
Paroubek's budget removed money from income and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the government's opinion, adds funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, sickness benefits or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of state debt nor international disputes.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and the Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they trusted that the government would later ask for a loan for sensitive expenses, rents or sickness benefits. "That only means postponing problems for the future, it is laying mines," says Janota.
What happens is that when you borrow money, you have to pay ever higher interest and, one day, you have to return the money.
The state doesn't have a lot of options to get money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or operating expenses of the State, it has to increase taxes.
To all those who added the left now: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later on, your children too.
People don't have to worry about income or sickness benefits, they'll get it. 1.8 billion of these accounts are gone.
But the price to pay will be the increase of the public debt; next year they will not lack in the treasury only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase along with interest expenses.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer be able to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity benefits, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year there will also be five billion to complete the construction of motorways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the invitation to tender has already been made and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed, nor can their price be reduced.
The most you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
This means delay or cessation of the 30 large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mostly owned by the State, and will add the fund of transport.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless sack.
Last year ČEZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Each year the dividends are paid ecological damage, serve to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
Moreover, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit to the level of 5.7 % of GDP.
The cash transfer carnival doesn't end here.
Almost three billion were obtained from the budget to grant several compensations to victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation costs, including in construction savings.
It is not clear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international dispute, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Then, the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, hand over the government budget reserve.
There are also a hundred million missing for the Státní pokladna project (State Box), which is worth two billion and has already been launched. It should allow you to monitor online what the various authorities are spending.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister doesn't find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will arrive, says Janota.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
The Americans will have a mobile phone where the user can, by pressing a key, switch between various operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With just pressing a key, they move in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of computer virtualizer software.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at a time.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was shown for the first time several days ago.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer any fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a RAM memory of 128 MB, where the above mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is at its height.
The VMware company cooperates with European and American operators to test smartphones for virtualization and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only do telesports in Krkonoše worry about snowless tracks.
The lack of snow makes people not reserve ski stays in hotels and pensions.
For this reason, free rooms can still be obtained in Krkonoše for all winter dates, including for Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether this Christmas will be snow or mud," mentioned the maintainer of the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend at Špindlerův Mlýn a New Year's Eve according to their expectations, should not hesitate to book the stay any longer.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place can try to wait a few more days.
Špindlerąv Mlýn hoteliers mainly offer weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but they will soon give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlabí's travel agency can still offer the New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
They are sold very well also on the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there's snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the snowless mountain.
If the tracks remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will also run out," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February is also sold well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the stays in Nochevieja are already occupied also at the Omnia Hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, at Janské Lázně's most recent hotel at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a great surprise to us, as we find approximately sixty percent of the capacity to occupy.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, mentioned Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
However, for the moment it seems that the hoteliers of Krkonoše will be given the desire for snow waiting.
On Thursday the temperatures must fall and, if there are precipitation, in the mountains it should snow.
But then again the temperatures will rise, Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic, reported.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, eagerly awaited, it proved to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is the phrase "like in Iraq" used several times, but it did not hesitate to use the title of the Bush declaration of January 2007 for its own statement: "A new way forward".
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized him as "an irresponsible and catastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that today there is no talk of Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, yet objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
Field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan General Operation Stanley McCristal. He, even despite traditional subordinate relations, subjected the indecisive rifles in the White House to a harsh criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he fooled the general over 10,000 military personnel.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself had at least 10,000 previously.
The most problematic thing about Obama's entire strategy seems to be his goal, starting to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and completing this procedure in three years. Obama's whole doctrine generated more questions than the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the chief every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin. After him, patriarchal tribal relations will remain.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confusing relationships, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum objective of the whole operation, seems very real.
Obama's strategy horizon is shocked by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that the military sent to war so that they "come home soon," will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of the American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphal withdrawal of Afghan troops.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left for the presidential elections, and that is why there is still a long time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will not receive the cash bonuses again
The top executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to combine Wall Street bonuses with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest way to go, mentioned former investor banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced criticism after having set aside almost $17 billion (almost CZK 30 billion) for the bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the agency Reuters, probably exceeds, despite the measure announced today, the $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a delicate issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax only once, with a tax of fifty percent, the bank bonuses that exceed the 25,000 pounds (approximately 712.000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories less Physics
Five women, which is a record figure, received today in Stockholm from King Charles XVI Gustavo of Sweden the Nobel Prizes this year, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, she was among the award-winning also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded by two US biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as her compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was received by Israeli Ada Jonah and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last prize, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was awarded by the American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each prize winner collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to 10 million Swedish kroner (approximately 25 million Czech kroner).
In case there are several prize winners in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The traditionally most expected Nobel, the Peace One, received him this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of having been awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are essential for achieving peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers his resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the finance minister Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is supposed that the budget, and perhaps also Janota's stay in the cabinet, will be the topics of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too great, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
President Radim Ochvat's spokesman reported on the appointment.
About his stay in office, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the Budget Act, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of KR163 billion.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the proposals of the left for transfers of funds and increased the money for salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government disagrees with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the SDG, ČSSD and the Green Party, are beginning to be controversial.
Critics say that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of saving measures, imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long been unsettling "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president believes.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is appalling and that the government should think of its future existence.
The vice president of ODS, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described similar words as "strong feelings".
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will exceed the 200,000 million crowns.
Wednesday ČSSD said the approval of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
The populars were also happy.
Send it to Clint Eastwood's new film, played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that Hollywood's new film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the protagonists play them American actors.
History speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by the American actor who won an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play it in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood's drama about the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, of the fictional president of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to put an end to apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to join rugby players, who belong to outsiders worldwide.
The South African team made it to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to get Mandela's story to the movies.
He had no other goal to play this role in such a way that it was as much like reality as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I discovered that when I shook his hand, I received his energy, it was transmitted and had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh rugby world.
A big surprise to him was, when he finally met with Pienaar at his house for the first time.
I remember calling the door, he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "In the movie I look much taller."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of the director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and also talks about ambitions for the Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety magazine Todd McCarthy summarized his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well done film."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The secret of the splendor over Norway resolved: the Russians tested a missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence eventually acknowledged yesterday that near the borders with Norway tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The "Bulava" missile, formerly destined to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimír Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly or a fault occurred in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulavá" as "a missile that doesn't fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the aircraft.
The engine probably went off in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a boat that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulavá".
The Norwegians alike from the very first moment did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by saying that one cannot speak simply of a failure.
The first two phases of the missile lasted and the damage occurred in the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately broken down in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely wrong, according to the Ministry of Defence management, only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost fifty percent full of optimism to the generals and therefore continue to claim that "Bulava" one day will fly smoothly and that it will even carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA from Moscow at age 51
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will return to a professional hockey match at age 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play on Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to settle some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to raise the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice tracks, he will become the longest professional player in Russian hockey.
The legendary fronter Gordie Howe played in NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty-one years, during the entire season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the five famous Fetisov players, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union won two Olympic golds, seven World Championships, won in the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing with Detroit won twice the Stanley Cup.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Glory.
Hyundai met the requirements of the trade unions. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent extra work, the unions declared Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, spokesman for the Hyundai automobile factory.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary supplementary work for Saturday, December 19, that is to say, it will work in two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working on Saturday's shift.
The bonus will also be paid last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vańka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime, or they can take a day off on December 28, i.e. extend Christmas holidays in one day, Vaněk mentioned.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will receive money for travel and food.
Because the additional work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all the additional work for December, Vaněk mentioned.
Car factory employees were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts, and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and trade unionists must be held on Monday morning.
The head of the unions Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday, that if they committed themselves to meeting the requirements and signed the document, they are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent additional work.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The trade unionists in their statement of Monday's strike emergency also demanded that none of the employees, who interrupted manufacturing last Wednesday, be penalized in no way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, trade unions require the company to minimize it.
In addition, this year a salary of KKK 5,000 is required for this work.
The automobile factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The series production was started last November.
Until last September, it produced approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the 'hot' HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can moderate the spread of HIV in the organism
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, such as some medicines already accessible.
AIDS can't be cured until now.
However, the life of patients may be significantly prolonged by a mixture of medicines that prevent the replication of HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the virus replication is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, drugs no longer work.
The work of the experts of three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and Heidelberg University demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called metalocarborans have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of HIV.
Metalocarborans are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way different from all medicines used today, and that is why they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, ‘improved' compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
Metalocarborans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A Traitor and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV proteases, there is no fractionation of the HIV virus and no mature and infectious body cells of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, explain scientists in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was carried out as a test piece, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which the drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes, that metalocarborans are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína İezáčová, the head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemistry Chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
The head of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for the coming year is "spanting" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, according to him, think about its future existence.
ODS statements were pointed out by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say there's time left for analysis.
The vice president of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas the Prime Minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to rely on the minority, who is trying to fight against the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
Yesterday's Chamber of Deputies approved the 2010 budget, but with the amendment proposals by the left, for more than 12 billion kroons.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the ODS proposals, as they cover the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion kroner.
ODS before the vote left the room and thus fulfilled the desire of the government, that the modified budget is better than an interim budget.
Disillusionment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and the feeling of futility; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will re-evaluate the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of approval of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká TV Janota asked for a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He pointed out, he's thinking of staying in the position.
The reason is his disappointment at the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, Nečas says in the government they have nothing to do with the ČSSD nominees, which imposed changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear, if he resigns, whether the Chamber adopts other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness grants, income, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the SDG are not guilty
It's the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
Ministers nominated by the SDG have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the lieutenant posts there are people who belong to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed, that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the fight with the height of the deficit of public finance, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that it is based on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of SDG members.
I have not thought about it, when the time comes, I will deal with it, said to the journalists in the Chamber of Deputies the defense minister Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by the members of ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer in the afternoon went to a European Council meeting in Brussels.
ODS gave in at the Prime Minister's request
Nečas stressed, that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would probably vote against the modified budget, if the Prime Minister does not explicitly ask ODS Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he responded to the question, if ODS is not concerned about the absence of the party leader in parliament and the Czech Republic during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned from the mandate, he knew that in the following months it was mainly a matter of Bolshevisation of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, he reacted to Topolánek himself.
According to the new ČD train schedule, fewer trains will operate at almost the same rates.
České dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule comes into force.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will gain, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostravasko region, dráhy for this line will add a pendolino cart.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not return to Bratislava.
On the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will circulate less fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the biggest reduction in transport planned by Drahy is in the region of Hradec Králové, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding areas.
Two night trains will also be cancelled in the Prague - Tabor - České Budějovice route and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced only to a few days of week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15. line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long distance links to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní nádraží station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From December 13, travelers will not travel to Bratislava again in Pendolino.
This year's regional rail account: 200 million more than before
Fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover so-called Dráhy demonstrable losses will receive the coming year four billion crowns in total, just like this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains drahy have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always a year.
Drahy are happy with the system, and perhaps that's why they didn't increase the prices of a vast majority of the tickets.
Changes will occur only on one-day tickets - ČD Net and on cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card the ČD Net price will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the single price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippine Armed Forces continue to detain more than 50 people, children released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including a number of primary school pupils and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only about 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children detained and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The abduction took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say that approximately 19 armed men use hostages as a living shield in the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the surrender of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency the armed belong to the New Popular Armada (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police previously persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence, whose cause was the adjustment of the accounts between two clans of the local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao it was because of the recent killing, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the 23rd November massacre related to the governor's election were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province was arrested in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuan.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
RSA's story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official title in Czech is Invictus: Neporažený), which captures part of the biography of former President Nelson Mandela of the South African Republic, is being released in American cinemas.
The role of the world-renowned fighter against apartheid is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the leading role.
The second role, that of the legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, together with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa preparations for the world championship in football are culminated. At the same time the media are shaken by alarming news about the increasing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to AP news agency, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the leading roles by the "little interesting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman says, however, that he's proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to - as is said - collect his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the movie we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book of British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. Retreats South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long separate years. Just like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as protagonist also puts on the suit of the national South African rugby team and enters the playing field. RSA won at that time the world cup.
By entering the grass in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially of the white public and the recognition of white inhabitants.
The football championship may be able to help people unite and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical, as he said, for example, in a recent interview for LN, an amateur rugby Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko a transformer burns with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire caught in the morning a Čeps company transformer in a switch box near the village Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for the firemen in the Ustí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, however later they changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing matter.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were none injured, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's spokesperson, the damage does not endanger the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, enumerating it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatová it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity nothing similar happened, the faults of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokesman of the ČEZ company for the Czech Republic, the electricity supplies were not cut, and the fire from the electric substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or companies.
A.s. Čeps påsobí in the territory of the Czech Republic as sole maintainer of the distribution system, of the electric conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It retains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electric power of the transmission system to the distribution system, and maintains the electric conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura will file a calumny complaint to three ČSSD hetmans
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will present a complaint of slander to three social-democratic hetmans.
They are Michal Hašek of the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek of Pardubický kraj and the hetman of Olomucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in twenty minutes on Radiožurnál.
Demand has to do with the company's efforts to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with České Dráhy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the cake raisins", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say that we are more expensive than České Drahy, which is not true. We know the prices of České Drahy, which were fixed last week.
So there's nothing left for us to defend ourselves.
It is because of the slander towards the society Student Agency, he said to Radiožurnál Jančura.
At the same time, he mentioned having the evidence of all the regions, and according to him, they have not taken the necessary measures in accordance with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other hetmans to do so too.
I suppose, on this occasion too, it will be clearly demonstrated, that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses lies and false arguments, Hašek mentioned.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million kroner in advertising, whose aim would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radiožurnál told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České Dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the commission of approximately 150 billion crowns did not call for a tender.
According to Jančura similar steps disagree with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a ČSSD MP, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't leave it, we can lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of ČSSD, I know, which gentleman it is about, I am not going to say his name, Jančura said today for Radiožurnál.
Pneumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual habits.
As a first vaccine should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine culminated.
The Institute for Medicinal Products is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have already made it clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January onwards, children born since 2 August last year may receive free pneumococcal vaccine.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or before have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine has to be received between the third and fifth months of childhood.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily allowed their children to be vaccinated against pneumococcus.
However, parents paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend on vaccines ranging from 300 to 450 thousand kroner annually.
Without clutch they will save on the treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent around 500,000 annually on the entire vaccination of children.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicaemia.
From pneumococcal infections in our country every year, 28 children not older than 10 years of age die according to hospital investigations.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the pneumococcal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Is the vaccine mandatory?
However, there are both opinions that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, said Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Its association has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, mentioned Kalovský.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure for vaccination against pneumococcus.
At this moment we do not think about it at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeÿ said.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the Paediatric Society Odborná společnost praktických dětských lekařą Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children would receive the vaccine, one can reason on the reduction in the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect, that from the coming year more than 80 percent of young parents let their babies vaccinated against pneumococcus.
Pneumococal vaccine is a big change also because since the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on in treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs were, however, afraid that insurance companies could "take out the money from health insurance."
Doctors will therefore have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in the vaccines 40,000 a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy at all, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved "in the theft of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police claim that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while carrying 90 frames in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan el Barbaro and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer stated that a family dispute may have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta, a 52-year-old son, told the police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta father refused to grant such permission.
Labour Party Defends Tax Increases in the Budget
Ministers have advocated tax increases and cutbacks in the pre-budget report, faced with criticism from the opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling "lost" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5 % increase in social security expenditure and a 1 % increase in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
cholera for social security
Trade unions have regretted that low-wage workers are punished by a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems".
The increase in social security spending, which will grow by around £3 billion per year, has enraged the business community, which states that this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
Key points of the report before the budget
Social security with an additional 0.5 % increase from April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75 % this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonds
The 1-point rise in corporate tax for small firms was ruled out.
Tax relief for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to estimates from the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns £30,000 will lose £90 per year and a person who earns £40,000 will lose £190, while a person who earns £10,000 per year will earn £110.
Ministers said that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "hard decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on 5% of the highest wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that tax increases and cut-offs were a "sand grain in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are big figures. It will allow us to halve the deficit, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again towards the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Finance Minister was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably contract by 4.75 % this year, much worse than the 3.5% decrease forecast in April, while the demand for loans would be £3 billion above the previously estimated.
"Lossed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the "debt crisis" of the Labour Party, said the projection of loan application for £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, avoiding " cynically" the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have included nothing significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election, win who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek to further reduce the deficit in the shorter term.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "stones of sand".
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that the time chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some disability subsidies from next April, mentioned above, would leave the Minister of Finance exposed to accusations of electoral maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that more people are being provided and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Fake budget"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 expenditure data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said that the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"This is really postponing the pain for later," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All major announcements will come after the election, win who wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant for Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been the false pre-budget report. Markets realize this."
FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. men suspected of extremist connections.
The US Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it's investigating if they're the same men who disappeared from their homes in Virginia state last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and in what circumstances they are being held," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing," the spokesman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said that the men were arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
He said that the house was already in the hands of the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, reported the news agency Reuters; but said that the US had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally poor, according to a report from the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details "models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man mentioned in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights record.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
The thousands of people arrested and the dozens killed in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election provoked the biggest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Jameni, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the story of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who claimed that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the outcome of the elections.
"They often hit me in the face," according to his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, in my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and he was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semiconscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had occurred.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was held in a container together with another 75 persons for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the discomfort of the post-election and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the investigations of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski trail was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a race track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, opposite a track of 100 meters long.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but that it was quite scary.
It looks under a beautiful view of the city lights titilating.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent," he added.
The awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After Thursday afternoon's event, the snow will melt.
Still them and us.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have asked to ban the construction of minarets and there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why French people don't like veils" ("Why the French Don't Like Headcarves") (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students about the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly worldly issues, he maintains, things of daily life, that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, teachers and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They can't completely spread this argument.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interview tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among the Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
Question to what extent French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defend secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are probably treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives "a value adjustment".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most desolate panorama
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have been focused on recently opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result of this.
Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
A knowledge of the complicated history and policy of whale hunting, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave valuable evidence facing the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter as a valiant 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The children, caught while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation at the beginning of the 20th century, he exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoos are usually a millionth part of the area of the wild adult area. The climate is hardly ever adequate: a polar bear resident in Singapore was greened by algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis resorts to stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, the US and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and eskimo-indians in snowmobiles use high-powered assault rifles to take down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice" ("After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and an overwhelming look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It's not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
It's not for lack of effort.
Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering travels at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries gave indications for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the submarines of the cold war drew a map of the moving ice cords that circulate under the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted on icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the affluent system inside the Arctic ice, formed by saltwater jets that are compressed while freezing.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice withdraws, what is believed may happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us.
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns in Arlington's graves
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown in the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning to place crowns in the tombs of veterans in various sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, initiated the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year stopping in different cities along the way, to run events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, tombs in the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated over $150,000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of his husband, a late career military.
As long as her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the broad meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed to the oldest tombs of World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they do not receive as many visits as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was joyful as the children played and the couples took hands, while carrying the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red loop tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the Soldier) donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the glacial air.
Some read loudly carved names on stones, while others leaned to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who mourned the tears of her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine Gunnery Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . my son paid for it, he said.
"A long time after my death, I want someone to remember it."
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, state officials of the State Department said on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
Specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested for almost anything that is considered "dangerous".
All activities called counter-revolutionary, including mild protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has applied on several occasions for permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permit has been denied to him.
The arrest of an American contractor can probably provoke tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "slow pace" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to release the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer in the United States Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of American citizens in prison in Cuba are in jail for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing mobile phones for free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the Americas of the Human Rights Watch organization, who recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, itself Cuba", a reference to the location of Raúl Castro as leader of the country, to replace his sick brother Major Fidel.
Vivanco said the accused are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US troops, expressing their hope that the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who travel the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
The investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after finding out that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube Internet video site.
Saifullah directed the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area on Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for the Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case, stated on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al Qaeda commanders that men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the official said, who spoke from anonymity due to the delicateness of the case.
The official said that the men did not change and were even trying to get proper approval to access the camps in the Qaeda, when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underlines the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who they are trusted.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has placed a major priority on trying to infiltrate people inside the Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting go of those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment of the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said that Qaeda is particularly attentive to aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent an enormous attraction, because of their potential to have access to American goals and because of their value as propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with respect to those who admit, because US intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than following the recruitment model than so many have already followed? Kohlmann said.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate action
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here through the streets demanding negotiators working at the Bella Center Convention Center of the city, bolder climate action.
The protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the amount was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English that said "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that declared, "the Earth says "that's enough".
Several famous people joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips Peru, her mother's native country, made me aware of the distressing issues with which the country must deal due to the impacts of the climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to world leaders, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it for longer.
The police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or wearing pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in climate talks, activists with sports masks and black suits placed several explosives near the main channel in Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were by the buildings, he said, adding that they started as called, but were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Within the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I really wasn't aware of the situation."
Then he kept saying in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depended on each individual's perspective to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and of different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said to affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Evidence reveals persistent racial differences
Last week's Federal Qualifications Book on Performance in Mathematics was a very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country's best-performing systems, the Qualifications Book showed that fourth- and eighth-degree students were hit at a faster pace over the past two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Evaluation of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African-American students and white students, both at the local and national levels.
The average scores of fourth-degree white students in the D.C. over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American pairs increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance gap grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the eighth grade African Americans remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
The average scores of the whites were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth grade students in 2003, when the first ENPE was released in the District, was 60 points from the scale (262-202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only been reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democratic), were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole according to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflictive, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates educational equity in the District.
I am not leaping for a difference of two or three points, said the Council member of the D.C., Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By Accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton Elemental.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee's style of administration, said the message of the test scores is that the city's high schools have a desperate need for attention.
They clearly always want to see positive signs, and I respect them.
But what is worrying is that we are not devoting the time and energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper grades of primary and middle school, who did not master the early reading foundations in their school classes and are considerably behind their peers.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum of mathematics from kindergarten to sixth grade, emphasizes games and experiences of real life, which was introduced in the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the level of degree, Rhee said.
Others say ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase overall performance of the system and yet provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here is a sort of slippery dilemma for Michelle Rhee," said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of the conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the objective can generate political repercussions that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban overseers, she tries to hold onto the middle class white and black.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our barrio schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance difference is to extend the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes almost 200 days to have the force of change, Janey said, that he reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year in a year of 185 days, which he considers as a "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next agreement.
Making higher education a part of the future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resolution.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, descended and blinked for a moment before the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Even so, when she and the other eighth grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where enrolment costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
This is where I will be! Graciela exclaimed, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Boy, seriously?, he said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the low proportion of school teachers-students.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you are going to college.
The question is which one.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave secondary school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access the university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these second-generation Hispanics graduate from university, a remarkable achievement since many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's workforce.
Those who analyze those with higher performance say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Watching low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the tour by Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to implement university readiness programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue to finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending university, according to the United States Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a leading role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, maimed for decades of war and sanctions.
The American companies moved away having bidled on only two of the 10 substained deposits.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who submitted an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for substandard deposits in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It'll be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Concerns about security, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as US military retreats, probably prevented US oil companies from taking a stronger risk in Iraq, which has the third largest crude reserve in the world, said analysts.
American companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The major American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have bonded with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Oil Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered in more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two main sites.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesman for the Assam Jihad Oil Ministry.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be alongside its competitors and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
The companies selected to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the barrel subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels at each site.
The main planner of al Qaeda has apparently been killed in Pakistan
It is believed that an alleged U.S. missile attack on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan has killed a major al-Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men who was thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the kind operated by the CIA within Pakistan's illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, said an officer from Pakistan's civil intelligence agency, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the victim's identities, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking military planner of al-Qaeda, who led terrorist group operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to plotting around the world, said a senior official, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of American air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to the top command of al Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had quickly ascended into the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not diminish in any way the threat posed to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of the Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal zone, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led unmanned aircraft attacks has declined since summer, from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to a report from The Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decrease is perhaps due to enhanced tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while killing suspected informants ruthlessly, the site said.
The UN's highest envoy in Kabul about to resign
The top United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign his post in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by allegations of corruption spread in the UN-backed presidential election in Afghanistan.
Eide's exit happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the US schedule for military withdrawal that begins in 18 months prompts other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants, who are working together with Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I've said is that it's best that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's exit and my arrival.
Ban has begun to look for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and of covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said that Galbraith's accusations, who was fired, " surely damaged the mission, because there was already much skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by United States-led forces in Afghanistan.
It also promoted the leadership of the United Nations to allow its successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations to its powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN recruitment regulations undermine its ability to capture talent.
Such is how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran to Face Additional Sanctions · Global Voices
Defence Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, for its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs me is that if we've learned something from Iraq over the past six years, it's the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions directed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would be really less secure with nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer enormously" the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "believable" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the UN Security Council and its nuclear control agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would renegotiate on the restriction of his nuclear programme and would agree to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for this agreement, as a way of building trust between the two parties and gaining time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have strayed from the tempting agreements, in part, say the experts, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals that were actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way in which they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set the deadline on 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including continuing with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devastating sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday "unfounded and baseless accusations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said it has the will to continue with talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was about to return to Washington last Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to Iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in United States projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. US officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that lectured them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that, when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly changed their course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
We have nothing left for a second, said 31-year-old Wang, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of a single child's policy in China, creating two generations of notoriously sloppy children, single, malcreated children, affectionately nicknamed "little emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six of when the policy became effective, according to Division
UN demographics, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to operate from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is well above the overall average of approximately 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with very cultured populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people 60 years of age and older accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aged population and mitigate a future labour shortage."
Shanghai is about to be "so old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
Gradual relief
Drafted in the constitution of the country in 1978, the policy of a single son of China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced so far by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for their contribution to avoiding critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have performed abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to an unnatural high male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their position on single-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 they attenuated many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Demographic Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost at night in the morning, the posters ordering families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide brochures under the doors.
He has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very unsurprising.
Disappointing response
Although rural city officials outside Shanghai argue that they observed a moderate increase in requests for couples who want a second child after the campaign was launched, the most urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, it is still expected that the number of births in the city in 2010 will reach only about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu Municipality's family planning committee in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want children anymore.
They want to give their first son the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West missee the one-child policy as a matter of rights," said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the first child of the couple.
Yeah, we're being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said he wants a single child because she too was: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and we really do not want to care for others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, owner of a translation agency, explained it more strongly.
For parents with two races, middle class, who reduce the birth rate, he said, it's about having enough success to be selfish.
People aged 20 to 30 grew up watching their parents' struggle during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and do not want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are issues of space, "must remodel your apartment," and the strategic "must have a curriculum prepared for the best day care when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Developed by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not speak of how much money rich countries would give to the poor to face global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, which include how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the overall temperature increase that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process," said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's top climate official, Yvo de Bóer, described as "the great panorama."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged the talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, Friday presented the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks last week.
The United States Special Climate Envoy, Todd Stern, rejected claims that require mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is adopting a tougher line with China, with respect to what the Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not agree without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of China He Yafei, stated that the top climate negotiator in the United States lacked "common sense", or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically to cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the major powers of the world at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the major powers are discussing who should cost the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to contain the big emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, Ulate said, who also works as a regional climate change adviser for International Conservation in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that the talks will produce a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, prepared a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations "has put political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now unified and demand the action of emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before the heads of government close a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and ran to the halls of the Bella Center, to closed meetings and press conferences, to be able to define the claims that will be arbitrated in the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where each day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, the activists who play guitar present night shows mocking the countries that they say are being sold, and preliminary hand-to-hand proposals are passed instead of mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues," said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for the global policy of International Conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
The first train to 225 km/h from Britain redefines that Monday feeling
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country's first high-speed long-distance train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes like lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas Station in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened and the change of aircraft and cars to rail would reduce national coal emissions, as well as ease congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds that are needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still slow Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the Midlands of the West will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a radius of 25 metres of a definitive route.
It is also expected that HS2 will set up three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option that is being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railway.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is designed to withstand trains of 400 mt in length, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the space constraints of the capital, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to fit the high-speed network.
The experts from the railway industry argue that only St Pancras International or Euston stations offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if it starts the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
In the beginning, trains would be forced to leave fast lines along the existing lanes north of Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered the crucial point necessary to ensure a change of aircraft to trains, a point of reference for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers face the mortgage for an orange of £75,000 from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange that he built at the home of his electoral district.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the deputies lived "of rations", increased his mortgage by £75.000 to build a oak framed extension in his second house in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of the expenses of the members. Last night Mr. Duncan said that the applications "cannot be clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an orange.
Neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not requested to make any reference to the increase in the loan during a recent investigation by the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges into his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, after an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of £271,406 from his property in London to the house of his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, the previous year to become a deputy.
The documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was applying for approximately £1,400 per month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, your applications increased to over £1,800 per month.
Mr Duncan's mortgage interest rate on the Royal Bank of Scotland did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the 75,000-pound loan.
The standard BRE mortgage rate fell from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March this year, which is now the case.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for £1,250 per month in May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as President of the House's opposition in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him saying that Members had to survive "rations" after the scandal of spending.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live with rations and be treated as m**rda."
He said: "I spend my money in my garden and ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask a lot more, but I don't."
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the star pound symbol on Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after revealing that he requested £4,000 for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primary improvements, approved both by the salary office and later by Legg."
He added: "It's not about eluding and delinquing or breaking the rules or anything.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could not in any way be clearer or simpler."
Those who have faith come, to see the calendar of the Brighton beach palapa Advent
Brighton's palapas have found a new impulse for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palates for each day of December, using villains as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palate from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with stuffed cakes and ponche served for free.
The chosen villains so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Noël, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid clergyman of the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the calendar of the Advent of the palapa began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday in demand of an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where the police detained several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded through the frozen Danish capital in demand of an agreement to be reached by the United Nations Conference on Climate Change by Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization for climate throughout the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the demonstration began in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with adoquins and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, they are especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinctions", stressing that one hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took place at the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without attempting to enter.
A scenario was raised to welcome guest speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a wake-up call.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from the major European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with heavenly showers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate."
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lady Nacpil, Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: there is time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers dry, water courses that can be walked as never before had been made.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of antiglobalisation, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unify climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming does not oppose the struggle for another world".
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial spike to demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people went to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, concentrations of hundreds of protesters were formed, demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected President; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Election tables closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to the leaders of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, the participation was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved the scrutiny of votes.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili, " regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After his separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia attempts to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the election table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large panels show Bagapch next to the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, district chief Beslan Archba warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
At a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate Moscow's support, and in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia control of the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, contends that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
A 50% plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went out to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where the police, on alert, detained more than 700 people around an impressive demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the middle of the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts until 18 December delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that will have to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the center, not trying to enter.
A scenario was raised to welcome guest speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a wake-up call.
A few moments after the demonstration began, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them on the floor.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolet clusters that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
At the last hour of the afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw with a dowry, and four cars were set on fire near an occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of some 20 people, according to the police.
Extremist groups don't get their eyes off, I warn the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while law enforcement helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by coach and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present like some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with heavenly showers responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate."
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lady Nacpil, Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

Oxfam together with the former UN Commissioner for Refugees, Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together many islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial spike to demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people went to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, showed red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the Philippine capital city hall.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, concentrations of hundreds of protesters were formed that called for action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).

The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that it will be broadcast in the Sunday Informative (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific high school.
From now on, all the students of the first high school will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "it's enough with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The branches of General and Literary Education cannot be sub-branches of the C, it goes on to emphasize even: "I also heard that historians or intellectuals were outraged that they had eliminated history and geography in second high school in technological schools."
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven Frenchmen of ten (69%) disapproved of the government's project to eliminate compulsory history-geography teaching in second of high school C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right-wing elected representatives also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "no talk" of eliminating philosophy from the second high school program C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a mobilization day on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will give an admission test that will aim for their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also practice in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practice.
If you do all the proposed practices before the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also confirmed the project to eliminate the school map "before 2012".
In the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain convincingly the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit, a challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), invited by the Ulm Street High School of Normal, accepted on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the "Ernest" conference tour, a day composed of a series of fifteen-minute presentations of experts, filmed and open to the public, reported a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and convey to them a desire to know more, explained in the framework of the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish from the pond of the school.
We chose about twenty participants from among the experts of his discipline and selected them on his charismatic side, he specified.
About global warming, "we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," he told AFP Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of some fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, waiting for the public to understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific dossier".
The videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school's website as of December 15.
The next "Ernest" day, followed by others at a bimonthly rate, is scheduled for February.
Delay in payments: Disgusting among prison guards, it is planned to take action
The prison guard unions called on Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end-of-year holidays, bonuses and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers' Force (2nd Guard Union) asked off-duty personnel to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block" them to denounce the theft of their assets.
The CGT prison (3rd trade union of the profession) calls them to "meeting in general assemblies in the different prisons in order to achieve a mass mobilization", since it calls of "sorry and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "extra hours, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Union Penitentiary (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellery reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing them that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
Request the Directorate of the Prison Administration to implement immediately a set of measures to ensure that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be low, except for management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous bonuses for functions and objectives, and who "always blames the budgetary requirements", the Ufap/Unsa deplored.
It is a real scandal, said outraged the interregional FO union of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and summonses".
The staff will not come to work on the corresponding Sundays and holidays if the October days are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, threat also FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
As the tasks and missions increase without taking on more strength, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, estimates the prison CGT of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, not in all regions the same happens, as some are more fortunate than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected one, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "best gifts" than the ones he receives
US President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous television host, Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion as to gifts: "I make better gifts than the ones I receive."
During a special interview that ABC will broadcast on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the end-of-year parties in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be in the game.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to the extracts of the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he receives: "No way, last year I made you nice gifts," she said by provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before answering with humor by pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered his favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who saw rarely, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
Only many years later, I found out that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her doll house.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the home, however, I loved that doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims he's in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was again intervened in Los Angeles due to important "injuries" resulting from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his close friends, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened on Wednesday night to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors verified "injuries from the operation" of hernia disc held in Paris on 26 November, pointing out his press service in that same city, indicating that such injuries "need a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey tranquillity by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be communicated within 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about his condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no cannula would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Monceau Park due to a hernia disc.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
The singer Johnny Hollyday entered the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection resulting from Delajoux's intervention.
singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, explained on Thursday in RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time," but he said that he did not "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter".
He called me just before he traveled to Los Angeles, and I told him it was foolish to make twelve hours of plane after such an operation, it is not possible, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, sought to reassure him that Johnny Hallyday, "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer's health problems multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days as a result of a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, as a general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on by a "colon cancer" after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as expected, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been overly commented on. Fanatics and journalists have noticed the musician's difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his close friends even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/short pool: first Bousquet title in your favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medallist at the 2009 World Cup long pool, won an international title on Thursday in a distance where he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in a short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition where polyurethane bathers were last allowed, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, brand that has in long swimming pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman was imposed with 20''53 during an end where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international primacy.
Bousquet advanced to Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world brand (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I said that if the world record were within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimmers who will be banned from January 1st.
These swimmers, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, finished their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of the swimmers did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark by 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he imposed himself with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up in this race.
I knew I wouldn't be able to beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: A sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola was sold in USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday at $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art marcher.
This panel of 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "that represents four dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and drunk women, is a rare piece, since in the world there are only four or five", explained Tuesday to AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of the ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's.
It was sold between a hundred batches.
The sale continues, but until now, this lot has been the busiest by the buyers, without doubt, pointed to the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For nearly 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the III French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For some fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
By reviewing the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that the conditions were not given to transfer to its territory the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the coup government denied the safe conduct.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to take Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General for Migration.
To grant him a safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "renunciate" and to seek political asylum abroad.
But the overthrown president refused because he wanted to get to Mexico as Head of State in guest practice.
The coup government "has suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my office (...), they wanted me to present my resignation," Zelaya said on Thursday to radio Globo, in which he has often made statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been taking five months in the country of Central America.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added playing some chords the deposed president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy submitted a request for safe conduct to us, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an application for asylum, said on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, to the Honduran radio station HRN.
I will not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview on the Telesur chain, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as President of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, strongly besieged by the military.
Brazil's Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the coup government's position.
This reflects the marginal nature of this government against international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela's socialist president Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on 21 September and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
De facto President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term of office ended on 27 January.
Wall Street goes up, the US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Thursday, the US trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405,83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7,13 points reaching 2,190,06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose by 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on US trade balance figures, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States trade deficit fell in October by 7.6 per cent from September to $32.9 billion.
The analysts expected, on the contrary, a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of trade volumes, in particular, exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies they market with the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research company Economy.com.
On the other hand, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, and 474,000 applications were submitted.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "was the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller, from Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond amounted to 3,482% against 3,423% on Tuesday night, and the yield of the 30-year bond to 4,492% against 4,408% on the day before.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power flock to the "Ladies of White"
This Thursday, hundreds of supporters of the Cuban government seized the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on the world human rights day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty "Ladies of White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of these detainees, said a journalist from the AFP.
The Yankees die!, "Mercenarias!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raúl!" crowned the militants of power to the dissidents with their fists on top.
The latter were escorted by officers dressed in civilian clothes who came to "protect them".
On the eve, a similar demonstration broke out against the White Ladies in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also ready to protest on Thursday for the international human rights day, was arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, reported AFP journalist.
The officers forcibly went up the vehicles to dissidents who were ambushed by government supporters, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances only lasts a few hours.
The "Ladies of White", awarded with the 2005 Sakharov Prize granted by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison term.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call the opponents "mercenaries" or "agents" at the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Made very rare in the media, Cuban television reported on the demonstration on Thursday of government activists against the "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alienated man assassinates an octagenary with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded another five people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (High Sena) on Thursday at the hour of the greatest influx of the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have beaten two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an elder, at the pharmacy or in front of it in No. 85 of the Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, reported police sources and witnesses.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a head of the Alliance police union.
Later in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, intervened and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the elder died.
The life of the other wounded, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a fainting and was admitted "in shock", a police source reported.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped through the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently at random, he would have injured two more pedestrians: a man of thirty years old, and a man of forty seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he had crossed his back, he explained in the place a leader of the Alliance union in the Upper Sena, Arnaud Pressé.
Several transients, among them young, tried to control the alienated, according to the testimonies obtained by the AFP.
I saw a guy about thirty years old in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, said Alberto, waiter from a nearby bar.
A crowd threw themselves at him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
By the Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, attempted to arrest the armed man and were beaten to death, according to police testimonies.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are numerous shops.
Some people came to tell me there was a wounded man on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old gentleman on the floor. When I put him in a secure position, I perceived a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, approximately 35 years old, with knife wounds, arrived.
National police forces arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor ' s Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Department of the High Senate Judicial Police (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his provisional arrest, he did not speak.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of placing him in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all of this kind's upset whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
USA: Polanski's lawyer asks again to dismiss the case
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski claimed again this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of "El Pianista", denounced three judges of the California Second District Appeals Chamber serious procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977.
Hummel stated: I claim that at the same time the charges are dismissed, since the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the same time, Laurence Rittenband, "has been chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (deceased since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison before sentencing, which constitutes a serious procedural breach.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September "to have lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in the event that the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward at first instance, that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as long as Roman Polanski was not brought before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "illegal sexual relations" with a person under the age of 13.
Since then, the United States has never stepped again.
District Vice-Fiscal of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski "must be here to appear at the audience."
With this cause, do we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is the possibility of running away?
For her, the filmmaker "puts a favor to the court, even if he despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also highlighted "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel wasn't the only one asking to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She claims that her client no longer supports being harassed every time the Polanski case resurrects, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months after the prison, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad cabin, pending possible extradition.
Wall Street loses course and slows down the dollar's rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Friday without course, in a market that is discussed between better indicators than expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technological component, lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will be kept this way until the end of the year.
The trend was sustained by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve the market's opinion on the soundness of economic recovery," the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November per second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, the confidence of U.S. consumers was visibly recovered in December, 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indexes were halted by a further advance of the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months against the euro, which "leads down to sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond amounted to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and the yield of the 30-year bond to 4.497% against 4.492% on the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's tour of South Africa, the 112 Miss World women are in the final line to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them already achieved their participation in the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportsman or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real riot.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw a lot of things and lived countless experiences!, said Mrs. Sierra Leone astounded.
This nine-time event in South Africa will be broadcast on Saturday live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m. (3 p.m. GMT).
I can't imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have been working twice, points out Miss Mundo Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that take away the breath".
After a month of galas, essays, press wheels and safaris, Miss World candidates focus on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a great smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, with a swimmer.
Chinese host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and a Miss World committee leader Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa proved to be able to receive the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, President of the Miss World Championship.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Something unusual for a head of State, says Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've been dealing with people I never thought I'd get to know.
She's probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at the airport of Los Angeles to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, he told the press David Hallyday when he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1:00 p.m. local (21 h GMT).
The singer's son, distended, assured that he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection derived from the hernia disc operation last November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced from that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and thus being able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday for an infection, following a hernia disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was once again operated the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness a school act, confirmed a photographer from the AFP.
The Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catone, announced that he would travel Monday to Los Angeles to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on 26 November at the international private clinic of Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There's talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "travelled too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, as I was operated twice on hernia discal, he added.
Shortly before at the RTL station, he indicated that the singer apparently "had gone without a cannula, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at that time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed by brain hemorrhage.
This is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the courts on several occasions for malapraxis, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "a man without scruples" sued "with regularity" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being advisable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not require drainage," he added.
Anyway, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since summer, entered into a parentheses.
Undoubtedly, to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as expected, seems very risky to me, said Camus.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the acronym of the former Giscardist party, intimidating him to withdraw it from all support, only to be sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, as he considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after reaching out to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of his management, he received the help of Congressman Hervé de Charette (ex UMP, current NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and the deputy by intimidating them to renounce the acronym and to transfer the property rights of the brand to them, on penalty of judicial demand.
These past days, you have made many statements implying that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centralist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue with the use of the name of the movement, the +New center+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'now'hui+ in its militant material and on the presentation page of its site, they support the signatories of the letter.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to remove "immediately mention of the name of the UDF from any media, as well as from (your) website."
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) brand to the legitimate rightholders".
Failure to do so will call for justice to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In the letter, they need that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends "elected" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right, according to them, to use the UDF symbol.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the brand", he was no longer "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
Use scandalously and fraudulently the absence of registration of the UDF acronym to do so on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC's strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make its own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name that is not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
This Friday the Nanterre Court decided to bring to trial the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as stated by the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenarian to expolate her from part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star pictures of the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum of three years' imprisonment and 375,000 euros of fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th Court also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years of age, to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to undergo such examinations, even further under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed this Friday will be required to submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness and during what periods.
I think he'll take it.
I'm going to talk to her, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, on leaving the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is excellent news (...) The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years now, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multi-faceted artist, accusing him of taking advantage for years of her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
Liliane Bettencourt, for his part, always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom he considers to be a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the origin of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' allegations were, on some occasions, a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters her client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
Since his wedding, I could never speak to Françoise again."
For its part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office once again considered that the complainant was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardianship judge refused, in recent days, to give rise to her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that the trial on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers would be held.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the big French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of employees joining "values" determined from above as before it was a question of imposing on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer in the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to the strategies of conquering markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to the customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
Demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R & D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, the IB (Business Intelligence) "requires that all parties involved (...) have proactive behaviour and a forward-looking vision"; it needs a commitment on the part of employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
For this reason, we call for a management revolution, which would consist of putting the employees at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as Orange's questionnaire among his employees, incite the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all the companies end up doing essentially... what they always did! B989
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology in a mechanical way.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old conductist theory that American "neurosciences" recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely spread behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent investigation of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms to managers in a position of mechanistic management, inadequate to the world today.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies means adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating in any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to become a reality of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motivational Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
The studies showed that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined twofold that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilization factors, business managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate the management of human resources "in the place".
In this way, they create a favourable ground for the organized development of strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: for the "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the American right, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed Obama's speech on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited Obama's award on 9 October, applauded the presidential speech this time, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, said Mrs Palin, the main figure of the right wing of the Republican party to the newspaper USA Today, and added that she herself had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
Terrorists must be stopped, he noted.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, this Thursday in Oslo, to justifying the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives was delighted, who appreciated in particular the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For the moment, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, whom some consider to be a possible candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear "a left-wing president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or could deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current chronicler at the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting as a "citizen of the world", as "always does," "he spoke as an American president" by reminding Europeans "who live in a security bubble that they did not create and do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced rightwings, a hawk of the Bush era, former UN ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "monotonous, pretentious and uninspired" on the website of the National Review Online.
To the President's left, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed by seeing Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
However, the left-wing press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, although he still believes that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, described his speech as "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," said the Californian newspaper.
Obama "pronounced the speech that was needed," the New York Times estimated, judging it "both gloomy and uplifting."
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the unions in the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers' organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon at an agreement that puts an end to the strike slogan and the threat to Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "enjoyed" by the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators fired at the dawn of Friday in the hope of quickly signing the text according to the last hour of the morning.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTHER) withdrew by giving a doorknob.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "had been very damaging to companies" and "we were afraid it would disturb the end of the year parties," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9 per cent for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8,72 euros to 9,06 for low wages.
Not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will order our militants that there will be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centres.
But there can always be some disgruntled rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement that respects employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, above all, address the issue of extraordinary pay and modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of EUR 100 million in employer charges" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the draft law on rectification finance for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
TLF's signature allows the agreement to apply, first, to companies affiliated to TLF and, secondly, to the entire profession, in case the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "as soon as possible", said Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR reported that it was a "business of naïves", since the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in a situation of urgency, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to contradict those who want to eat turkey at the next dinner in Nochebuena, the Unestra regretted.
For the OTHER, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of a lot of SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The conflicts in RER A, France's largest public transport line, will continue during the weekend, because at the meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between unions and the RATP management, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their premium request.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, Saturday and Sunday only trains will circulate between 10 am and 8 pm, due to one train each in the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train every four in the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which wait for 200,000 customers each day, were pleased that "RATP strives to provide service to large stores."
The RER A crosses from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, approximately one in two trains circled in peak hours, and almost no train in valley hours, as expected.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the Andeans thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on schedule".
Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, said SNCF, which had provided for police and law enforcement oversight.
The RER As operated by SNCF from or destined for Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general assemblies of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analyzed, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting that took place with the management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers who claim a premium that they are owed, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even put its premium proposals in parentheses, commented outraged the CGT, pointing out that the management "was not able to solve a problem that SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", explained RATP.
Which also led trade unions to say that the company "did not care about weekend users."
In the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
Then the leadership, which until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents submitted a notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (GGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions in this line that has one million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of bonuses, for hours with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Justice Dissolves Prokurdo Party, a Decision with Serious Consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-eastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task, which has just helped the Kurdish community by trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that adversely affected the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, told the press after four days of discussion.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are out of political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 benches in Parliament (550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament before being party-based parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure launched by the Supreme Court Prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, accusing DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many more countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party claims that it does not have "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the Court intervenes at the time when the government lends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders stated that a dissolution could lead to an increase in tensions in the Southeast anatoll, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the Southeast mostly inhabited by Kurds.
The Forces of the Order threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while the protesters threw Molotov bombs or stones with hoops.
In Istanbul, approximately 100 people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of justice was to "deepen the discouragement".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by dissolving a party, it told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
At first we oppose the closure of parties.
This is not how anything is resolved, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
This Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks of recent months.
Snows can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
At all, it's something that you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the FES winter road maintenance director
But with this your employees can learn to test and master the entire vehicle technology.
The weekend may be announced by meteorologists for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the FES acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it spawns profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A sections come out with large salt vehicles, Brauburger explains.
For example, main arteries and avenues such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also the accesses for the fire department, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sections with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around three in the morning
They should cover approximately 1,040 kilometres, as necessary, within a maximum of three hours with moist salt, which adheres better.
That's why the FES starts around three o'clock in the morning, "with this the tracks are free until the traffic of the peak hours begins."
The hard thing is when it starts snowing around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," says the road maintenance director in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear up the salted vehicles."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, to which also belongs the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is on the side and side streets.
That's where the troubles are generated, Brauburger knows well.
Around five o'clock in the morning, the FES infantry is launched, mainly dangerous points and cruises are cleared.
In general, the FES could not be taken over by all bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, Brauburger says.
As these become slippery quickly, the salted vehicle starts as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of an emergency, the police can also call them.
The birthplace of the dinosaur
The Tawa found had the same appearance as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal of two meters long and 1.50 meters high running on the two strong back legs, had an extended head with sharp teeth and curves, short arms with claws in the shape of a hole and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa found was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry area of the Pangea supercontinent in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavation in 2006 at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes, we have found on a day a dozen dinosaur bones, this is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis a member of the Utah Natural History Museum team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they gathered in total the remains of five specimens.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional finding: "The dinosaur fossils of the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not fully share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current trend of opinion, dinosaurs first appeared approximately 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, the experts discuss, for example, when the sarians divided into their three most important genealogical lines: the carnivorous teropods among the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the herbivorous Ornithischia (sauri with bird pelvis), to which, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus belong.
According to Nesbitt's analysis and colleagues, Tawa finds himself a primitive therapist.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in Tawa's skull, researchers found signs of air bags, such as those that also possess the descendants of the teropods, birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa, the bones of the spine were evidently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag therapist, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the posterior giant sauropods also had air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, researchers deduce that the sarians first emerged there.
Therefore, the three genealogical lines were separated at the beginning and extended from South America throughout all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single earthly mass, the Pangea supercontinent.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa finds the remains of two other teropods not closely related.
The three cannot descend from a single parent predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three migration waves were given to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a brotherly group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says the paleontologist of Bonn Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many fossils of dinosaurs continue to be preserved, while in other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic the dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and pterosauruses and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs expanded all over the world and developed many new species, while the kinship was extinguished at the limit of the Triassic towards the Jurasic.
The successful stories were not eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a massive extinction that dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, an impact of meteorite brake the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Teachers from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the busy casino of the Goethe University of Frankfurt has had a worldwide impact.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, although also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, sympathize with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, evicted last week the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command".
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of investigation and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served "the delegitimization and criminalization of protest" and diverted attention from content.
The Governing Council has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused any material damage, it is said.
Protest legitimized
The young people of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also sympathize with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, commented the national youth secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the performance of the principal of the university and the police.
We're grateful to the principal of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented on an issue of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Parliament of Wiesbaden Province.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism, said Peter Beuth, delegate of the provincial parliament by the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of studying students' arguments and demands in depth, they are being evicted.
The Left has submitted a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapons investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from central Moscow, is considered to be the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, Selenograd representatives have contacted Riedberg's scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, university institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made, and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "close collaboration protocol" in Frankfurt.
The Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the Mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, led the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 they will travel to a seminar in Selenograd representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises at the Natural Sciences Research Centre.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also deals with commercial relations.
The FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In exchange, Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is home to important Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the great Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika consortia.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for weapons research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, in which research facilities were established.
Stuttgart brakes
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not placed at all high enough.
For the project supporters it is simply and flatly "the new heart of Europe".
The law so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, rather than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end up in the middle of the city, were considered at that time engineering fossils of the nineteenth century, which acted as brakes of a modern rail traffic, since it was formerly necessary a huge amount of time to hook the locomotives back forward.
Roll, stop dry continue the journey; but so must be done.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is about half the journey of the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "The Heart of Europe".
The S21 will really start, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impossible to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals of course also have no more entry and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's car at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new section built ICE towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and municipal politicians have arranged this.
The railway also continues because the risks of the large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
It creates new urban space, provided of many green areas, probably of graphics generated by the designer's computer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passing station and the road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous typical growth of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than trucking on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than EUR 6 billion must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be lacking in other crosses and narrow passages on the net.
A total of 60 major projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails across the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the slow-tracking has been built.
It would be urgent here to step the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The section of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for the international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government reviews the judgment on the airport.
The federal government remains pending in the autonomous parliament of Wiesbaden, if it will file an appeal to the judgment on the prohibition of night flights of the administrative court of Hesse.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have commissioned experts to conduct legal investigations into the VGH judgement, more than 400 pages, according to Minister of Economics Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had based in writing on this date, that in the case of the construction of the north-west runway planned at Frankfurt airport, the federated state would have to re-regulate the nocturnal flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January whether it is going to file an appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to waive the appeal to the Nation's Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of speech.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to fulfill his word, said the chief of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We fulfill our word".
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federative government would be trying by distorting the law and tricks still get their night flights.
Exhaustive legal research would take a lot of time.
The coalition would not like to act on the basis of a "first rapid impression".
We need a legally untouchable decision, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
As the opposition represents it, it would never have been his group's claims about the night air traffic ban.
U.S. banks return the aid provided.
The great American banks shaken by the crisis strip themselves of their state bonds.
The "Bank of America" returned at one time the aid provided by the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report from the NBC of the United States.
With this the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation in the payment of bonuses to the directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The "Bank of America" had earned approximately 19 billion liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had plenty of means, including the sale of items.
Bank director Kenneth Lewis thanked American taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The bank house had miscalculated the effort of absorption of the investment bank at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to raise money in the capital market in order to be able to free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from a source of known circles that the U.S. bank could already announce by Thursday the increase of its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not wish to comment.
By June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their aid.
Quick choice
In the end, everything was faster than you thought.
Just two weeks after the administrative board of the ZDF (German television channel) pressed the editor Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present a successor.
Last night the union intended to vote about the candidate.
The favourite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF's main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced not to further harm the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved on the administrative board either.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the union.
The result of the vote was not yet clear at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed on the board with his proposal to renew for another five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union on the administrative board had already indicated weeks before the election that they would not support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the editorial chief had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another term of office of the prestigious editor with the argument, that under the direction of Brender the information of the ZDF would have lost ratings.
Until just before the elections there were protests because of this, in which the political influence on the ZDF was flogged.
In the end, 35 experts in public law had even been involved in the debate, which qualified Koch's course as unconstitutional.
But it didn't work.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanic philology.
He then worked at the station "Südwestfunk" and in the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the news "heute-journal".
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning programme "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional demand after the removal of Brender, who was still elected this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
The opposite of Koch on the administrative council, the president of the government of Renania-Palatinate, explained last week that the federated states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the proposals of staff of the director cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A retreat of politicians in favour of the ZDF control unions was ruled out by Beck.
The likely successor of Brender, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the board with an intelligent play: he strongly criticized the union for the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence both Schächter was able to appoint him for the post of editor without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote for him, without being suspected of giving the post to a secular supporter.
In the calculations of the Frey parties it is awarded anyway to the left liberals.
University careers clear up
Partial success for students: after a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally gave in. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university principals, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of bachelor's and master's degrees.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the test load: basically each race module must end with a single test.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federated states undertake to make more flexible structural rules together for Bachelor and Master races.
Rules of the federated states that diverge from this should no longer exist.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the principals of the universities have been constantly talking about the improvement of being able to carry out and successfully complete a career (studiability).
Now for the first time there was talk of a specific content.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module completes with a single exam", it is said in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university courses.
With the "sensible reduction of the examination burden" it is intended to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future, "studiability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined in terms of unnecessary restrictions on students' choice of..
courses.
Students would have "the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage their own initiative".
These rules would be valid for new races, but also in the examination of existing races.
These must be "recredited" again every five years. But this would mean, it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be at the country level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which is set up by the federated states.
Ministers of education and culture urged the federated states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the quantity of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far only Renania-Platinada has ensured that it provides additional means for the further development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement mentoring and student counselling programs, as well as strengthen examination and foreign offices.
The Federal State and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010 the government wanted to bring a novel of university law to parliament.
According to her, a single exam should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year, it is intended to examine all the races about their "studiability".
This Thursday the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the federated state.
Apart from the compliments there were also criticisms about the decisions.
At the federal board of directors of the Juso university groups (socialist youth) it was necessary, that the configuration of educational policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" of ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the education strikes, now students as primary participants should be able to give their opinion as well.
The president of the board of university directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which the HRK discussed a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) Bonn's agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the Bachelor's degree to have access to a later Master's career.
In addition, the federated states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future enough study places for Master with the best possible conditions of study. Thus reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federated states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about increased access to the Master's degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Getting in and out of Germany is virtually out of control," says the first line of a poem by the lyric Werner Söllner in unbalanced idiomatic fragments, in which he themes the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who gained his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in an editorial of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was given several literature awards, in 1993 he gave memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse at Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said he had to talk a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his dossiers of Securitate"
Visibly insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate against fellow German-Roman writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Attempts to recruit had begun slowly in early 1971.
"I am therefore someone who did not defend himself sufficiently in the face of attempts to provoke fear of Security," Söllner concluded.
The lyric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Herta Müller and his literary controversy without equal with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene was shaken, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania was shaken by a case that evidenced the abysses and wickedness of a political system, which was based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only an author, but also a victim.
In his dossier of Securitate IM Walter had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after the confession of Söllner, and emphasized the influence for him positive of IM Walter.
He had excused it or defended it at all difficult points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies of the Security-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller already in July in the weekly "Zeit", after reading his own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and will have known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike the review of Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the handling of security control files is still quite widespread.
Systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is rather traced.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview, after awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still quite large. In this interview, a former head of the Security of Temesvar spoke in spite of the decoration.
"She has psychosis," in the end they only questioned her once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself unturned in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, like so many times when there are silent faults.
Why just now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to the confession of Söllner lets hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the cravings of knowledge and not so much by the award of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill your stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart's VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team's supplier, boarded a Class C Mercedes taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, he gave the impression that an elegantly dressed outside service member was coming out of a very nice Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer would have distributed samples.
The man with the bald feature had hired a driver, because he still didn't know the city.
Moreover, he could also drive the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was the 55-year-old man drunk of joy.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow would start work again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we reached the eighth at the end", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to triumph 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "most important task" was waiting for them the following Sunday, he said.
Then it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the everyday life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly demonstrated again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lucky
The eighth finals of the Champions League (go-side matches on 16/17 and 23/24 February/return matches 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So joy was kept limited by the fulminant entrance of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, who had soon inspired the disconcerted Stuttgart professions to trust themselves, willingness to surrender and pleasure for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, explained the Gross soul repairer his recipe of success that so simple sounds, but that with the therapist Babbel had no more effect.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse emerges in football, sometimes things happen that have not been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a several-week break due to an injury, immediately advanced to becoming the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new boss worked: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what I had missed, obviously, when Babbel was there.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs, above all, consistency.
Like Gross, the players and the administrator also refrained from overvaluing the triumph against a defense weakened by a lack of relief and totally outstripped by Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 the sad awakening had come, he thought Khedira.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that although one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt did not want to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by the porter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, faced Heldt's harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had blamed weakness in the direction of the board of directors, who had decided to change coach due to the pressure of teenage fanatics.
Also that his day off after the games would have been eliminated, Lehmann described him as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt said, and announced consequences for the zaguero.
They probably won't be friends forever, the two quarantines.
But at least they agreed with all the others that, without previous efforts with the replacement coach's team, it would not have been possible for the show to be of great force of play and battle.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important participation in success," Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; and he also agreed with the plastic suitcase man.
World Heavyweight Championship Fight
Burning duel in Bern: Over and over again the rector Kevin Johnsonn was provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges' trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains a heavyweight world champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version won the American Kevin Johnson on Friday night to Saturday in Bern by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone had expected could not be carried out.
Klitschko extended his balance to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give up due to his injuries.
Retator Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
In front of some 17000 spectators in the Berne Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was eluding over and over again from the World Champion's blows, so Klitschko could not decisively lead his dangerous right-wing goal.
In general terms, passive Johnson did too little for a retractor, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie," who "can't do anything."
When the weight was weighed, the champion let himself be provoked on Friday to take Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of almost four years, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time, and had recovered his "belt" from the WBC, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year he later won in his defenses of the title to Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola of the United States.
In this fight I only received one blow, and I am in very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is a world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he destroyed Nikolai Valujev in November, 2.13 meters in height.
In the previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company promoting it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defense, Gutenberg, a liar, due to false information on the Kunduz case.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about Kunduz's air attack, the opposition has blamed the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), for having misled with knowledge of the cause.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast, broadcast by ARD TV channel, Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin said that the minister "had not known the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he said lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and which Mr Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it had been announced that this attack was not only about destroying the abducted trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air strike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, they died or were injured up to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel had to clarify whether an intentional murder strategy was part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether the Chancery, the Army and the Information Service had approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his Greens colleague Renate Künast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, strongly rejected the criticism.
The chancellery did not exert any influence on concrete actions by the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, questions had also been raised about the Ministry's presentation on the grounds of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on convoys.
It had been officially said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it was clear that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report by a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far he has not received an answer, it was said.
The ministry did not appear on Saturday regarding the accusations made to it, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Oniric worlds
In a state of vigilance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill and drug addicts do the boundaries between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can give ourselves unhindered to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleep-like states during vigil, or sees and hears things that others don't see or hear, is most often regarded in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as manic.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drug addicts.
Guilt has our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes make the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality unravel.
One-way modified states of consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castañeda, the states of Chamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neural communication substances in the brain has been derailed – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts often occur.
Gravity no longer has power over it
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in the state of vigil, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great similarity of the state of madness with the states of onirics", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the misappropriations, crazy formations, and speculations of it".
It's the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comical figure.
Its body is two-dimensional and scandalously colored.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of devils with wings, with red mussels like blood, deformed, filling their teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him at the walls, he feels the pains all over the body.
Strict and evil voices resound from the walls and the radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult him and offend him.
Henning T. starts two wires from the stereo, ties them to form a hanging knot, and fastens them on a hook on the roof.
He climbs into a horn and puts his knot around his neck.
Jump.
The rope's loose.
"Go to the clinic and make them cure you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was the LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, it is also manic-depressant, it takes medicines, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; psychiatric clinics treat it as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the times those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, disorders in the relationship, or persecutory mania.
Especially extended is hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the doors to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatric clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning addressed to it.
At the same time he enters a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot organize them actively.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in your life
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle just as."
The paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distance from experience takes place in reality.
For the researchers, it's still a little unclear why our brain makes them rattles.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality provisionally.
But not all people develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determining factors.
Researchers assume that the affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains an unknown how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a previous disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis as they interfere with the brain's transmitting system.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive medicines to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says Professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The Unreal World in Our Head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychological disorders such as personality limit disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and cranioencephalic traumas .
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers from hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are usually repressed.
It arises when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or poorly cohibited; when our brain is hot, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of love or other emergency brain states.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mendestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attending a high school.
A regular girl.
If it wasn't for those images and the voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, it happens that a boy torpedoes with long and dark hair directs the word.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit of a strange dreamer, but Sarah K. She knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she sees and hears that boy, the same way she sees and hears the girl sitting in the bench next door.
You may even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes you wonder if you're crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class sometimes he cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains in a visible and audible way the mathematical equations.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room when the sleep arrives, which often comes late and is scarce, he cannot distinguish whether he is awake or dreaming, whether the images he sees, the mussels or the girl with bloody cuts in arms and legs, appear in front of his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
Her parents and friends haven't told anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Fall of 2009. Sarah K. He's 20 years old today.
He approved last year selectivity and lives with his boyfriend.
It's been a year since hallucinations disappeared.
Ever since he's been in contact via the Internet with psychologist Kasten, he knows he's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art for despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or has a stimulus restriction, it is very likely that after a while he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unoccupied and takes care of itself to look for entertainment.
Sarah K., the only child, was in little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he's been calling Dad since he's been using reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. They find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "has a place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate his hallucinations as a special skill.
The boundary situation between sleep and hallucination
in this world too consciously focused, imaginary experiences usually pathologize, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a harsh and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is an art work of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Oniric hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers to be real and that subsequently cannot differentiate from being awake.
Oniric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis being completely conscious. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with a world of its own and imaginary that is uncoupled from reality.
A form of boundary situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change of world, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to a situation in itself that our own ability to create allows us not to sink into the nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on several days' journeys after an operation of heart valves with included heart transplant, while his body was condemned to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen plunged into a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he was put down in bed, an older man on board a sanatorium on a train, a robot was watching for his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with firn snow and met with a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describes your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come

The children will take care of the editorial at 27 years
The new editor Kallen has arrived at a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, commented to SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, confirmed Burda, 69, to SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they're trained to do that.
One cannot put in front of 7,500 workers their children, if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end up with the kids and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will withdraw from the chair of the board of directors from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52, has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he took over the treasury and thus became responsible for the company's assets. Following the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member occupies the top of the editorial.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old. His son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to, "save the differences of 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With a look at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are also not safe from decadence: "This has always affected families who are left to get infected by the pursuit of capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had "deliriums of greatness," Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world league either; those businesses have become too big.
Full Beauty
Everything - in the matter of beauty and well-being - you can wish for, within your reach.
This is what seems to have been proposed El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mimo of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai - which is responsible for laser waxing-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teapot stands out, with more than 130 classes different from this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while you contemplate the city's unbeatable views, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to ride your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a Jacuzzi session, massages and taking a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spaxion.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most novel facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to combat cellulitis or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'trainers' that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts by inserting your personal key into a touchscreen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to correctly perform our exercise table.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdressing, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 in the evening.
Miscellaneous hatches
Christmas is nearing and you are never to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party costume.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we should consider.
There are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The electric company Endesa, together with the City Council of Barcelona, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements on mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to boost what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electric citizens'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVEL Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
This is intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has assets a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the motor sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, glimpses "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main exporting sector.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has put in place throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Auto Competitiveness Plan, today we would have an overview of abandonment, closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (IPA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 ancillary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to developing new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and car brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Exhibition of the Classic Vehicle will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the engine mountain.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters with more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will classic motorcycles and cars be found, but ClassicAuto Madrid will find articles of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, among the pavilion exhibitors, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of classic motor that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, sale of cars; Juan Lumberas, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Cochera Classics, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Exterior skill tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: holding concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles on an enabled circuit outside the trade fair.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sport
Mazda wants to show that sportiness is not at odds with respect for the environment.
For this reason, it has just incorporated into the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system -baptized as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved in its entirety.
Finishes, vehicle termination, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving station, we found that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and hold.
Also, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Following the set formed by the instrument painting and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
We can therefore say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the habitacular, this Japanese compact has more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
All of this is combined with a large trunk with regular shapes.
The engine's automatic stop and start system, at least for the time being, is only available with the two-litre and 150-horse petrol engine and the manual change of six gears.
This engine is a real delight. It excels for its fineness, for its reduced noise, for its performance and for achieving a consumption content.
And it is that although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not perform a high number of kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high running comfort, and for its consumption content.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, i.e. the one that incorporates a greater number of serial elements.
Of the series equipment stands out especially the track change assistant (RVM) that eliminates the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, in case of little equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: bixenon adaptive headlights and BOSE sound system with disk charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
Special emphasis is placed on the quality of the materials used, on their behaviour and on the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 2.0 petrol engine of 150 horsepower.
The only inconvenient of this model is its high price, which is between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the proven version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, Mazda3 will offer us every day large doses of satisfaction.
Luxury 'First'
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensuality from the hand of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexy' at the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even being able to see some kind of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
To see it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
In view of the success the company has taken out two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as your U.S. counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with smartphones already know what it is to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a café with WiFi (or a Fon connection) in order to consult the mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small letter.
The repeated European Commission earshots to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (does not stop being curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) obtains this type of rate means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other Internet queries.
No contracts and no gaitas.
It is a connected device and is paid for it when buying it, not monthly.
And that's what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a life-access option like Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the first American lady.
If you have already come to the takeover of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this colour, you have chosen the same one to accompany you in the second most important moment of your life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - green yellow with bright reflections - the two times the outfit was composed of three pieces - clothed, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and adorned with a great embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the stellar of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestaurio.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for taking possession of a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with stamping.
The complements have also varied: half heel green shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one collected on this occasion, melena releases the previous one.
75 per cent of working mothers have had work problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and work history of women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to motherhood.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of couple living and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unsteady job, start living together as a couple, advance the first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay living together and motherhood, and have less offspring.
"Women aged 35 to 49 years with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, an increase of 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time from their lifespan to get them, which has led them to postpone the union and arrival of the children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a great deal of influence on motherhood, although less influence on the timing of the pairing," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women by marrying and having the first stump.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at which they marry and the older the first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education have been mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average respectively.
"Another division is also established among women according to their level of education.
While those who have elementary studies get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those at middle or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," Delgado explains.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envious list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become an image of different brand products, playing the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses in the international scene, joins other famous files of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male section, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomy of Grey') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, both yesterday and today - met in the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's Poker
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Poquer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) a thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in cases, also the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and fearsome genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but looking for something similar to the nucleus of ignition of the creator character.
The trip has its excitement and Vicent does not save fears or lighting.
In addition to exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and rereadings.
Here I leave you a few snapshots.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same one that I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against the axiety destiny, blameless morality and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling, meaningless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed on the north wall, from which the best mountaineers are taken off again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he once said he was heir to a county landlord and others who was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the insane cry cast from a bridge by that Munich character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century under his literary form and did so on a journey running away from himself and invoking posterity with a violent discourse to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she got on her knees and prayed: 'Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were recorded these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ rest after the war,/ after the full life pleased death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband normally accepted that she told him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been a case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but go to Baroja for Faulkner's weapons?
What did this do but abduct that man's fame so that he might serve him on his own pedestal?"
Coward aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a mixed-race specimen, rescued from the dog and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, offered her two kicks that left the dog hurt.
Our indignation is magnified because we do not find the fun in a free assault on a small, defenseless animal, which, by the way, was bound.
To this must be added the suffocation that caused a woman to walk quietly and that, when she blamed these individuals, she became afraid for their physical integrity, since an energument that attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elder or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event occurred at five o'clock in the afternoon of any Tuesday in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubt it would serve a lot and not generate susceptibility, just to clarify that the killer cowards were Spanish.
Indignantness has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to mistreat free of charge a helpless animal that gives us affection, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people are.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the helmet, mainly among the younger drivers, informed today both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while travelling on a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, that "it goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day" and stated that it also contributes to this goal through other actions of a pedagogical and informative nature.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum diffusion.
Finally, Michelin emphasized that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main aims is to develop increasingly safe products.
Increases the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, most importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employers of the manufacturers Anfac and the sellers Ganvam.
The good data, not ostentatious, should be quarantined, since the reference to which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the peak of the last month, enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40% lower than in the previous year.
Since January 95,853 units have been sold together all vehicles that make up the tailor box of light commercials: derived from passenger cars, pick ups, vans, light vans and light trucks/chasis.
Nubarrons that most affect their demand have also not disappeared, as although they are also purchased by private individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
Thus, other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation must be added to the restrictions imposed by the closed tap of bank loans.
In view of this situation and unlike tourism, aid for the purchase of 2000E has recently been used.
In addition to individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs who are to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer may benefit, but the number of operations has been testimonyal.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles as well as to industrial vehicles (wheels and buses).
The sales association predicts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a fall in sales (of tourism and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already compulsory
As with anti-locking ABS brakes and will pass with ESP stability control, emergency braking systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles of new registration, while for the rest a period of absence is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, by its way of work, it can also help to avoid many collisions by scope.
The emergency braking assistant does what it does is to increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the treadmill that the driver gives.
But this does not always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, the third of the drivers involved in an accident had not come to tread the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance the car uses to stop.
According to an EU study itself, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four accidents with damage to people would be avoided - when so-called intelligent emergency braking systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts the utmost effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays the Opel plan until January
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been notified by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - the 8th probably - according to Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that it will take more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points in the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document to be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM ensures that a decision on Saab's sale should be made in the next few days.
It is not strange to this that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM supports contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but takes strength the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is supported by the Russian group Converg.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to the Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is maintained if not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its last, and expensive gem, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as the base and managed to lose no less than 80 kilos, which left the scale at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, in the first place, with the automatic roof that has been supplied by one of the canvas with manual drive, thus saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of GT3, 'caen' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, gained 7 kilos more; mounting sports sticks another 12 and with light wheels of 19 inches, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system provided another six kilograms and changing the door handles by one cloth, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with the dual clutch PDK change, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly on secondary roads of California, in mountain sections with actually turned tracks
Their behavior can only be described as unattainable.
Weight reduction does not imply that the car does not step on asphalt with aplom.
Rather, the opposite: for a long time we had not tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, it was so safe to pass by curve, even at high speeds.
He's a little athlete, able to heat his muscles in a short run for the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, brake, recover and repress his engine...
Thanks to your address, as communicative as it is accurate, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine braid, already debuted previously in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from stopped or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with Boxster Spyder was pretty punished, but the car digested the bumps well.
Electronic aids hardly made an act of presence all along the way; and that which in one of the curves we found ice at dawn and gravel, well in the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, of the most fun driving you can in the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be for sale in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
"Bag Girl"
Intimate by Karl lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the 'maison' parades, the singer prodigates her malata face with as much bruising as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caisse Laboral achieved a brilliant victory for 82-91 in his visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra court, despite the numerous casualties with which Dusko Ivanovic's team counted, and in this way he is placed in the lead of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triple annotated was the best of his team (29 of evaluation).
The Victorian team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer to the end to make up for victory.
In addition, the great right from the perimeter, with 16 triple annotated had much to do with the final triumph.
The match began face to face for the blueberries, which were put from the beginning forward on the marker.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already presegrated that they had jumped to the Israeli court with hot dolls..
English and Teletovic were the main architects from 18-20 to the end of the first part.
The second quarter was more than the same, but the Alava team opted for Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received with pits and applause on the return to which his home was, to further expand his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'minus six' of Splitter's assessment already presegrated that this was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the party, despite being locked to rest, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that in their field they did not win anyone, and with 'Elías' hand' tightening they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the return of the yellows to the bright (50-49).
More Disadvantages
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but not much less dead, needed to hijack a couple of games with good luck to catch air, and in those arrived the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a reassuring income (54-67), who managed to make up the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaves went out to leave their skin in the last partial and English and St. Emerald (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what had been deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by faults, Ivanovic's did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the party already owned and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The injuries prevent the Unicaja from fighting
The Unicaja lost strenuously in Greece to the Olympiacs and gave him the leader of the Euroliga group B, in a match marked by the bass of the cajistas, especially in the interior game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion and not by the rival's entity, perhaps of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of Omar Cook's base and one of Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacs were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja , although the arsenal of the premises in the interior game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, when an action, fighting conato, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, was the disqualification of both players.
The Greek ensemble began to function by showing its superiority within both areas, where the loss of the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults were tearing down the cashiers.
Between the indoor players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An Impossible Rewind
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacs, which, despite the 19 losses, showed itself superior and even came to equal the difference of the meeting held in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which caused the group leader to tumble.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last descent of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the encounter.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja for the direction and triples of Cook, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacs when they pressed and given their superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to go back to the 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja shut down, handing over the lead to the Olympiacs.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application by Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of classified real estate, employment and motor ads in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must introduce their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is running, the searcher has found that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges €45,226 gross annually and a French one, €31,059, compared to the 24,000 that a Spanish one receives.
Similarly, a driver charges EUR 34,247 per year in England, EUR 25,751 in France and EUR 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by dependent, with 14,725 euros; and operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are those of drivers, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets the date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian Government has put an end to Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed President shall leave the diplomatic legation by 27 January 2010 at the latest when he or she officially completes his or her term of office.
Francisco Catunda, business manager of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he remains a refugee since 21 September.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to seek another destiny."
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
Following the November 29 elections (in which he was elected Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by the rejection of Zelaya as a political assailant, which was intended to impose on her by the "de facto" government that President Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which the inflation of assets has been the dominant focus on the markets, again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving liquidity-free bar to close to zero rates for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically been completed and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand into the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reduction.
The volatility of the Stock Exchanges and the differentials of corporate bonds have re-emerged, although they remain far removed from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the differentials of the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision at the bottom of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not go wrong to silence those defenders of moral risk who were once again trying to raise awareness of those responsible for global economic policy for having slowed down the destructive effects of credit restrictions on job destruction, when what should be done is decree a new Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle among the Emirs to regain power in the Emirates and Greece has already seen it before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro country to breach its commitments.
What makes sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within expected.
In the Spanish case, as our public debt differentials expand as European corporate bonds do, we must not worry.
If European differentials decrease and our differentials continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most of our study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their scenario upwards by 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, that they return to burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augurate much life expectancy to their warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudence, friend driver".
Related sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommission of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain is discussed these days in the next two decades.
After his speech, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few strokes of what he had raised in the subcommission in camera.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 billion up to 2020 and another EUR 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power plants are kept open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
That is true, Iberdrola believes that over the next decade, investments should not be directed towards increasing generation capacity, but towards distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue is changing and the power will have to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, that is, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the Government has just adopted is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to bleed with the real decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "puntual" measures, as the President of Iberdrola called them.
As it may be, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, must begin to be taken as they delay in maturing and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus' handling at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports in which it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not transcended, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castile-La Mancha Board and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaborative protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Center
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
He plays his first freeway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
It works for its first concession highway in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
French Bouygues and German Hochtief are her rivals.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to sit in the country as a builder and dealer of highways.
City Hall wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to advance the project, in a business plan sponsored by Ernst & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do with the work and exploit the toll.
Pending the submission of their offers next May, the planned investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (€1.047 million) and in the last phase they compete three consortia with a notable presence of European builders.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in Liza, and its companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (affiliated by the German constructor Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the local Baulderstone (property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil work Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it entails a clear difficulty of entry if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be an outstanding subject for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millionary assets
It acts by a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the business of desalination.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for lifting and managing Adelaida's disalator, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (north link), is called to join the western Toowong highway with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. It is the greatest action to reduce congestion in Brisbane traffic.
The schedule set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be finished until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute US$ 500 million (EUR 308 million) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear significant fruit for Hochtief, who yesterday announced a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
ACS's participation will enable, through its local branch Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fibre optic cable.
This action will provide quick access to the Internet to 400,000 people and will give work to the German for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the construction project of the 27-storey Tower King George in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still to be started and Hochtief has closed the sale by 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, you will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia worth EUR 64.5 million.
The firm obtains this contract days after it is done with the works of extension of the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the works is scheduled for early 2010 and will be extended for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore awarded Renfe's publicity
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services over the next two years to Mrs. Rushmore for approximately EUR 3 million per year, the railway operator said.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been elected from among the 16 agencies that presented themselves to the competition convened by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Many 63 million to France Télécom for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programmes outside the regulatory framework.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company accumulates more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore a repeat offence.
Application shop
On the other hand, the French company's mobile subsidiary has followed the wake of other operators and has opened a web application shop, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, Orange's app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça from its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
Both Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club that has earned the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the big clubs.
So much so that the competition has allocated €5.365.5 million to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have come out well from this distribution.
The white club has been the third in the continent that has paid the most for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the late European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich, the two teams who, in addition, billed more money for participating in the past Champions League.
And that, despite losing both to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved the most money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the agency that chairs Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will spend 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous round of classification (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just because they were there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each match they played.
There are also bonuses to win (800,000 euros) and to tie (400,000 for each team). The eighth-finalists will receive three million each; the eight-fourth-finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be packed 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to the finalist's 5.2 million.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, was paid 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main places, and has four places assigned.
The previous year's champion is left with 40 per cent of the money allocated, 30 per cent for the second, 20 per cent for the third and 10 per cent for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of games played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
The New Rumasa group yesterday degenerated the details of the stock purchase offer with which it seeks to acquire a top of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public offer of acquisition (opa) for the totality of the securities.
In particular, New Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share which would be disbursed in 10 years and which would be remunerated with interest for such a 1% annual postponement
Yesterday Sos' shares closed to 1.85 euros; therefore, New Rumasa's offer values the company 18% below the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects Sos' real valuation.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Hierezian group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of the offer, despite the fact that the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If realized, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when Sos' capitalization is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to stay away from possible offers of purchase and from the judicial vats of their former managers, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as internal audit director.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food business.
This is a new job that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos unveils new funds diversions
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday in the National Court the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared that they approved the deviation of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina's exclusion opa presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion opa presented by Investora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorises this operation by understanding that its terms are in accordance with the current rules and that it considers "sufficient" the contents of the explanatory brochure submitted after the amendments made on 2 December.
CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading in the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the finalisation of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the rules in force.
New tools for expert cars
In these days of storms and accidents, not only do they win the car workshops.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are towed to a workshop, where an expert must evaluate the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No harm is equal, and the calculation of parts costs and labour time can be a long and complicated work.
The cost of repairing between €20,000 and €30,000, including workpieces and hands, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools it would be a matter of decreases
That's why almost 100% of experts use these types of systems.
Service providers and disaster assessment and maintenance solutions are dedicated to collecting the information supplied to them by manufacturers, then to develop it and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Autex, of the American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of valuation and information-processing tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the extent that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new car comes to market, these companies get to work.
It is a very difficult task, because each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle must be catalogued and their price introduced.
In addition, from each model a graphic image is made "intelligent" where you can "pinch" different parts of tourism.
If it's a windscreen model, work can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Autex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars that are sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the development of the databases, Audadx has eight centers spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters are in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audadx invests EUR 90 million per year in the development of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for managing scrapping parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that can be given to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard solution of disaster assessment, intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each rating.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audadex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass concentrates on the moons of the vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the internet that allows to push for the declared total sinister vehicles.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know the deviations by omodel brands.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand have passed through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious accidents in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the valuation of damage, damage or maintenance of the car
The Gt Rating Guide is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per year over the last three years, and in 2008 they billed 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they began their process of internationalization, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global billing of the Solera group (Audex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19.1 million euros, a 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion, and now its shares are worth $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark.
Internet auction of crash cars
Last October the Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or sinister special vehicles.
The transaction amounted to €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of access to an immense international market.
This valuation and sales service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, renting companies, workshops, scrappings and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has over 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose frame number has been dropped cannot be recirculated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Cars with historical value can be discharged even if they have been discharged after a grievous effort.
Four-step workshop budget
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audadex company ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for replacement, create budget and generate budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who to a greater or lesser extent are more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 toasters, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, a computer with internet connection is needed to use it.
Once the model is identified to be repaired using its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then you can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaWorker is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalogue of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop orientation does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Audadex is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
