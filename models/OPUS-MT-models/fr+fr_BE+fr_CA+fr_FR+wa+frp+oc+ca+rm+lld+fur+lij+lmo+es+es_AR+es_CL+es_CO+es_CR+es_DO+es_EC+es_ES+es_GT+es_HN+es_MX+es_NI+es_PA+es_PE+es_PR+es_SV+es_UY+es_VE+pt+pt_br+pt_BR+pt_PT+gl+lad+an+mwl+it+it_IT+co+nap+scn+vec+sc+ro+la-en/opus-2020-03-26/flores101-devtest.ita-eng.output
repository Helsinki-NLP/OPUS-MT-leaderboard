This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely disseminated, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown brown chestnut at the top, with pale or carotenoid colouration at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information on the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the plumage of the dinosaur is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachide, but instead has other typical characteristics of feathers, beards and barbs, the researchers concluded that the rachide is probably the result of an evolutionary development following these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for the flight, but rather for the regulation of the temperature or for the courting. The researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the finding shows an adult plumage and not the chick plume.
According to the researchers' hypothesis, despite the tail belonging to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult plumage rather than that of a chick.

Scientists have been able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory argues that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of aloof, formed by a multitude of small particles.

The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has converted into law the decree that the sale or rental of video games with violent content are prohibited to minors.
The bill states that on violent video games sold in the State of California, a label with "18" is placed and makes it punishable for sale to minors with a fine of $1,000 in violation.
This morning the public prosecutor, Kier Starmer QC, issued a statement that both Huhne and Pryce will be charged.
Huhne resigned and will be replaced by Ed Davey MP to the government. Norman Lamb MP is expected to serve as Minister for Companies left vacant by Davey.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at the Westminster Magistrates' Court is scheduled for 16 February.
The victims were Nicholas Alden 25 years old, and the driver, Zachary Cuddeback 21 years old.
Edgar Veguilla reported injuries to the arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo surgery to reconstruct the face.
The Uka weapon did not explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blind from an eye, he lacks a section of skull and his face has been reconstructed into titanium.
Schneider testified through video conferencing from an USAF base in his country.
In addition to the Wednesday event, Carpanedo took part in two individual championship races.
The first in the slalom, where on the first descent he had a DNT recorded. Another 36 out of 116 competitors in the same race did not complete the test.
The other race to which he participated, the giant slalom, saw it ranked tenth in the female group of the category "situtes", with a combined journey time of 4:41.30, slower than 2:11.60 minutes compared to the first classified, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower than 1:09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place of Hungarian GyÃ¶ngyi Dani.
Four female group skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify in the race.
Madhya Pradesh's police managed to retrieve the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We also found her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their face covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed, while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Cambridge Hospital.
Since then, Adeloya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of killing his own son.
She is detained pending trial and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be polluted, since her image has been widely published.
It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has other parameters. In fact, the Scottish courts have considered the publication of potentially harmful photos.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee "journalists who publish photos or other suspicious subjects, walk on a mined ground".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for judicial proceedings, has told journalists that no new comments will be issued until at least the formal indictment.
The subject of the document will be the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders existing before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other themes addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement was signed, Israel demanded a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to abandon that presence only for five years.
Shooters within the experimental programme for the control of harmful animals had to be closely monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, director of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures to push the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission constituted Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, which challenge the regime.
Occasionally violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been scheduled since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and light burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 device-related incidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other incidents related to overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
In its reply, the ministry defined "absolutely deprecable" the postponement of the report by Apple.
The quake of the Marianne earthquake was warned at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage has been reported in the nation.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no tsunami signals in place.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his rifle M16 Rolando Mendoza set the tourists on fire.
Many of the hostages have been saved, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released together with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an old lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was hit to death.
Liggins went through his father's footsteps and began his career as a doctor.
After completing the training in obstetrics, in 1959 he joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While serving at the hospital, Liggins began studying cases of premature labor in free time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' with flight records.
His wrestling companions also wanted to pay homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Monday was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like you. A strong woman."
"Luna was weird like me... maybe even more... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... hopefully she's in a better place," said Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the poll conducted on 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal elections, people who opposed the move from Australia to the republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the interim prime minister, Julia Gillard, said that Australia must become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of the participants in the poll, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
In contrast to the survey, 29% of respondents argued that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% felt that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal should have competed in the 100 and 200 meters free style and in three fans at the Commonwealth Games, but it has accused several disorders that have led to doubt of its physical form.
He could not take the necessary drugs to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number ever known to today.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been one of the sources that led to water and organic matter on earth, that is, matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists want to understand how planets are formed and especially how the Earth was formed, having clashed with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he has placed his signature on a law that makes marriage between people of the same sex legal.
According to him speculations are nothing more than "shudders and political idiots".
One candidacy for the presidency is assumed in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology rather than obsolete ground radar-based technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate the aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being arranged and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while on the spot no car parks or interchange parks are available.
Fears related to the absence of the means of transport have raised the possibility of having the game played in closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published on Thursday in Science magazine, a new species of birds would be born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time needed for this process was much longer; this was due to the coupling between an endemic fringe of Darwin, Geospiza forts, and the pen of immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any form. It can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled up to form a thin thread, suitable for twisting and braiding. It can be hammered or rolled in sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate the hand painted images in the books called "miniatured codes" precisely thanks to the possibility of being made so thin.
It is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice it is possible to build a pH indicator.
The cabbage juice changes color according to what is acid or basic (alkaline) the chemical element.
The pH level of the chemical analysed is given by the quantity of hydrogen ions present (the pH letter H).
Hydrogen ions mean protons that have been removed from the electrons (since hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix together the two dried powders and then, with clean and wet hands, put them in a ball.
Between the moisture present on their hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water with a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini have been discovered remains of sewers.
The cabinets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes inserted in public bathrooms, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists resort to space telescopes because the atmosphere of the Earth partially distorts light and vision.
To carry a satellite or telescope in space, a rocket over 100 feet high is required.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is to have provided us with simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to its invention, they made their appearance the train, the car and various other means of transport.
Below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free domestic cats) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular objective that every feline has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in numerous groups called gills.
The gills are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Usually females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pack of lions acts in a very similar way to the pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other great cats), even as regards the mortal attacks on their preys.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (although not too well), swim, jump very long and exercise a traction force five times higher than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but resembles more a phrase of loud and rabid words.
Birds love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt for monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all preys they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that the oceans follow and find the animals to eat (prede) thanks to the smell, smelling on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, in addition to being able to move furtively. To hunt their prey, the ocelots mime with the surrounding environment and then fall on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (e.g. if it moves over a mountain chain or river, or moves on a new island, thus making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in an environment different from that in which it was first.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, in order to become a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it always looks less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb carbon dioxide expelled from them (through inspiration).
Plants make their own nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our houses from plants and produce clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants animals could not survive.
The moosaur was the superpredator of his age and for this reason he feared nothing but the other moosaurs.
From its long jaws, more than 70 sharp teeth appeared like razors, plus a further row on the palate, so for anyone who crossed his path there was no escape.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a biforcated tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fishes, other mossatures and it's also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although much of their food would appear familiar to us, the Roman banquets also provided for various strange or unusual routes, such as the boar, the peacock, the snails and a kind of rodent called giro.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate sitting on the chairs, the rich men loved to feast together lying on one side while eating their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include different foods, which came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for every divinity a main temple, which was considered the dwelling of the God.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid towers, called ziggurat, were built and became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life was outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sages it is said that it was Erik the Red to give it its name, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of its discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Although all Scandinavian countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "The Mystery of the Templars", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence a treasure map is drawn.
However, this is false. Even if there's something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the written "Declaration of Original Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears upside down in the background of the document.
Although it is certainly not known who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large document of parchment (measure 29.75 inches for 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be put back.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was only set as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing clashes had led north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was governed by the Vichy regime, i.e. by those French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded South France: this offensive action took the name of Operation Dragoon.
The American forces and those of the Free French had liberated the south of France in just two weeks and were heading towards Germany.
With civilization we mean a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civils", that is, citizen, and "civitas", that is, city or city-state, and in certain ways it defines the dimensions of society as well.
Cities-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of a nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural footprint through an equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, not being so recognized as true civilisations.
During the independence war, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and Congress was the only component of it, according to the Statute of the Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of executive or judicial power at the national level, it relied on the State authorities, often uncooperative, for the application of their acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between states.
In order to amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all the states was necessary, and these, on their part, had so little consideration of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, basketball, screen, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are more widespread in northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
They are part of the Japanese almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, we refer to Japan as an "archipelago", considered the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who were passing from there shortly recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East Indies Company in 1624 established a base in south-west Taiwan, starting a transformation that concerned the production systems of Aboriginal cereals and taking Chinese arms to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan ended up under the control of the Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the first Sino-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing government signed in 1895 the Shimonoseki Treaty thus yielding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island will remain under the Japanese government until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, notably the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Three Window Temple.
Most of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more precise idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu's site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for the photography of fixed images, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the film most used at the end of the age of analog photography.
It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm size is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the family of APS formats) are equal or very close to this value.
The so much exploited and often derisive third-party rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where placing the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines dividing the image into third parties, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
In this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which has become rich and powerful, became subject to scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between the European States for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and customary differences.
His omnipresent power has influenced anyone, from the king to the common citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary reserves exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the beginning of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supply, despite this blockade violating international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
The Great Britain mined international waters to prevent access of any vessel to entire sections of the ocean, jeopardizing also neutral ships.
As this tactic had given rise to a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate underwater war campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and effervities of the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendations written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in the previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: every period of China or every family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most famous was the so-called period of the Three Kingdoms, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these times, fierce wars were raging among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the most violent times in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to win a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since the army's classifications, instead of being class-based, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of the "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which survived the passage of time, offers itself a very clear picture of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave lies on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
It's not really easy to find, even if you knew the existence of it. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From the inside of the cave you can see or feel very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one arrived in our day not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The plain of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, houses numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheope), several smaller graves, various temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheope, and many of the pyramids, tombs and smaller temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and family.
The indication "arched up" resembles a V and the indication "arched down" resembles a graffiti or a square without the lower side.
Up it means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down it means you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards itself.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while with a descending arc it is a stronger and more decided sound.
You may decide to add your personalized pencil indications, but keep in mind that the signs of the archegy you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women in the market forced King Louis XVI, in prey to terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Maria Antonietta, to their two young children (Maria Teresa 11 years old and Luigi Carlo 4 years old) and to Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and shouted threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At some point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism sustained to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains resulting from the exploitation carried out during the time of the Filipino people constituted profits at the basis of US imperialism.
To understand the Temples we need to know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The time when the events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the XI, XII and XIII century (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which ended by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense that man's destiny is driven by a underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network only for a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with the ownership of a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured persons.
Romanticism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, treated by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time uses, customs and culture have emerged linked to this geography which, being in harmony with the context of society, have been more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly in Paris, known today as the capital of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
His reputation as a luxury nerve center began around 400 AD and continued at about 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century his prestige diminished, especially because of the fact that the Crusaders returned carrying gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of Gothic style was touched in the period between the X and the XI century and in the XIV century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
But the slowness of the lines of communication makes the spread of styles in the west possible to delay by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, the result of the crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced solely for the purpose of producing enough to satisfy the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his family.
Susistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, that uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at obtaining the maximum from crops.
Historically, much of the farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries it is still so.
Subcultures combine individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel represented by the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Often the members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners and argots.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who, due to negligence, misdeeds, or intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases abandonment is motivated by the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in wild nature.
When the feral child is fully reared by non-human animals, he shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that took care of him, such as fear or indifference to man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself simpler and more interesting, while the scaffold goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning mode, as much as a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, as can be the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but it is also the small graffiti assistant of Microsoft Office.
Virtual shelves are integrated into the software and have the purpose of questioning, soliciting and explaining the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing alone.
Children are given in custody for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee him nutrition, care and training, but happens to them.
We believe that trust represents a safe area for these children.
Our trust system should provide safe homes, loving parents, stable education and reliable health care.
It is assumed that the deposit will satisfy all unmet needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage theory and rewards.
For example, as important motivations for the use of the Internet, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested (James et al., 1995).
The Eighmey and McCord (1998) study on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships".
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out whether a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand the language spoken because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century the research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, that is hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digesting apparatus similar to that of humans it is difficult to satisfy their need for amino acids with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, the failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, in the end, also death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and vegetables, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In the light of all this, it should not be surprising that our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" in a certain sense as savanna chimps do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a recovery of sleep (10â€“60 minutes later).
This process can be easily put into practice using a relatively silent alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness, without fully waking you up.
If you decide to reset the clock to sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on biorhythm provide for the consumption of many liquids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force them to rise from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposed to the existing tension in his body and spirit.
Minor is tension, more positive is the existing vital force. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and grief.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. This objective is only hindered by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been enriched by the love course of the Mahayano rite and various techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has a foundation in Kundalini Yoga, in meditation and in a path of ubiquitous love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (light energy) by using yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and displays.
Deity Yoga is the heart of Tibetan meditation. By representing various divinities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, system, procedural and cultural conflicts caused the break-up between the two countries.
After two years since the end of the war, former allies had become enemies; so the Cold War began.
It would have lasted for the next 40 years and would have been fought for real, by mercenary armies, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already been collapsed; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge head.
These plans were, however, immediately obsolete, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Exploiting ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods through the oceans.
The task of the marines has always been to guarantee the country the safeguarding of its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time contrasting the ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most worthy of note is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time the German military navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, the goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago on the Zagros mountains in Iran.
They began to be raised by the cultures and tribes of antiquity to have easily available milk, hair, meat and skin.
The domestic goats were usually bred in herds left free to move on the hills or in other pasture areas, often cared for by goats (like shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These pastoral methods are still used today.
Already in the 16th century in England were built the wagonways.
Despite being formed simply by parallel wooden axes, the wagonways, when compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed horses to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The crossings were introduced relatively soon to keep the tracks in position. Gradually, however, it is understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a bar of iron on top.
It became a common practice, even though the iron caused a greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels left the place to those in iron. In 1767 they made their appearance the first railways completely in iron.
The first means of transport that man knew were the legs. Human beings began to walk in erect position two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means "right man").
His predecessor, the Australian, did not usually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal walking are present in the fossils of Australopiteco dating back to 4,2-3,9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelantropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate to some extent future sufferings we can start to adopt lifestyles more respectful of the environment, we can join the environmental movement and also activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If instead we do not just want a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and disable it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological progress of humanity, while the problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After the Congress adopted it on 4 July, a manuscript draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printery a few blocks away.
In the night they were produced between 150 and 200 copies, today known as "The Dunlap Manifestos".
The document was read publicly for the first time on 8 July in the courtyard of Independence Hall and was commissioned by John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which made it read to his room troops in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 borders of Dunlap still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are the ones we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that match them to dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on the two rear legs.
In short, the manipulation of information coded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently used.
A binary number can only have one of the two values, 0 or 1, and in the technical computer language these numbers are called binary or bit numbers.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the house of a container of open drugs or harmful chemicals.
Check if there are first aid instructions for that specific poison on the label.
The term mario is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of man.
Both the murderous and the bedbugs are nidic, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or in the home of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) records about 400,000 known cases, placing itself first among neurological diseases affecting young people and adults of middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research showed that the chances of developing MS among females are double compared to males.
A couple can decide that growing up a child is not in their interest, or that of their own child.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But it's not just experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations can guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria, i.e. viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations may have a number of different effects based on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the cells concerned belong to the germ line.
The mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Naturalistic tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, by visiting, photographing and learning to know the Orango del Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country to drive to work, crossing other people whose place of work is the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic Andirivieni, everyone is somehow connected to a private car-based transport system, which at the same time supports.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside of one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Each person participates in social life and uses the transport systems, of which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries it is rare to feel similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling into ruin.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they being broken every day? Are engineers planning them to be incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
"Traffic Flow" (or "traffic flow") is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from point to point and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers tends to fall into a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show a reasonable consistency and can be represented in a mathematical way generically.
In order to obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
The insects were the first animals to highlight the flight. The ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily to the enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold wings along the body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small ducks to hide from predators.
Among all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are unable to fold the wings are dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For someone he was right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), would move around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, why don't we have the feeling that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries an amount of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the largest river on Earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
The total 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The Rio delle Amazoni main river is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, and the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries flow into it.
They continued to build stone pyramids until the end of the ancient Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never overcome in terms of the size and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanting admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were far more than a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City consists of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and that with the smallest population.
The language of the Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of everyday use spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man has begun to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in ancient times: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them quite simply with the help of primitive instruments.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: land, water, air and fire.
These actually look more like the four states of matter, i.e. (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they were transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
The alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Obviously, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys consisting of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could get into the point at the end of this sentence.
After his invention, the pencil proved to be a good friend for many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and to an increasingly less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to get close to a temperatitis.
We can only wonder what fate the keyboard will have when something newer comes.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the operation of the fission pump.
In practice it's like rolling a heavy cart on a hill. So, further dividing the core, a part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break in the presence of a weak thrust or nothing.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the furthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria could be more numerous on the nearby side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the rise of the lava on the surface.
Content theories are centered on the search for what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people share and push them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that push them to do or not to do certain things.
Among the most widespread content theories are Maslow's Theory of the Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start running their former colleagues, two behaviours can emerge. On the one hand there are those who try to stay "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, apply disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibility.
At the extreme opposite, the manager transforms himself into a completely different person, who feels he has to change the entire team's work and do it himself.
In the end, the leader is the person who ultimately is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates dissension between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Virtual team members often have the contact point function for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than the members of the conventional teams, since meetings can take place according to the various time zones, which may not be included in local management.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The management team to which each member refers is defined as "invisible team" and that is what sets the standards for each member.
For what reason should an organization have the will to face the long process leading to the construction of a learning organisation? A good reason for implementing organizational learning concepts can be innovation.
When all available resources can be used effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and engineering can emerge.
Consequently, the journey of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
In order for an organization to be defined as innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain disease and behavior is the basis of scientists' research.
It has long been known that some types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors can influence behavior and modify certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate previously observed brain structures and processes.
This gives us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Although it has a strong science-based connotation, AI represents a very important informational branch dealing with machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research on AI includes the development of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of writing, vocal and facial.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Trips are a fundamental part of teaching. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see the artifacts of museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great pretext for sharing experiences and travel thoughts with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennett School, North Carolina, design a website on their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are marked by an unattended grammar and orthography, but usually the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, in order to avoid negative reviews, the author of the blog is committed to improving writing.
Blogs also "constrict students to become more aware of the moment around them." The need to feed the interest of the public motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as outline their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravez, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's evocative and bilingual capital, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the country's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and north you can admire the natural and unspoilt beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more make Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The large areas most in the north are sparsely populated, among which some are wild lands almost uninhabited.
If a comparison of the population is made, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States the number of Afro-American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent of its own.
Almost all smaller islands, known as luxurious seaside resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In the land the Arabs also took Islam, which took a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape's route, from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way to European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by Sahel, while to the south and west border with the Atlantic Ocean.
For travellers: everyone is recommended to declare that they are married, regardless of the actual civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they consider to be a nuisance, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grasped by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness of rejecting men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it by the name of Casa Branca, who abandoned it in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by Spanish traders who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping cities.
In the vicinity of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather items, narghilÃ¨ and a lot of hardware, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano lava destroyed Goma, separating much of the city's streets, especially those in the centre.
While Goma is reasonably sure, it is appropriate to document well before making any visits outside of Goma, in order to assess well the state of the clashes that still persist in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
You can use a wedding-boda (taxi-motorcycle) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu ended up becoming a metaphor of exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a fallen city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, because of the threat posed by desert sands.
In the special of Henry Louis Gates of PBS "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stages.
With its Arabicic rather than African touch, the city is clearly distinguished from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (Kruger National Park, KNP) is located northeast of South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, north bordering Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily contributions are provided for conservation and entry into the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card may also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline was compared to a glittering bar graph, even more evident because framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon in front.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development has concentrated on the heavily populated areas of the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for testimonies of the colonial past of this land, this is a good point to start from.
Sundarbans are the largest coastal range of mangroves worldwide. It extends for 80 km (50 m) from the coast in the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gange plain.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third consists of marshy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; in the area it is estimated the presence of 400 royal tigers of Bengal and about 30,000 maculated deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district highway (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those to the east and to Jakarta/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since service buses between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are reached by comfortable and robust small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge on the Oyapock River is a broken bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guyana.
Its two tralics have a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two wide lanes 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction ended in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
By September 2017, when probably Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed, the bridge should be fully functioning.
The GuaranÃ­ were the most important indigenous group living in Eastern Paraguay today. They were semi-mad hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and PayaguÃ¡, who lived in hunting, harvesting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonizations.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its indigenous identity and peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina has one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, in the polo fields of Las CaÃ±itas, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Here you can attend minor tournaments and departures also at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their official currency, the Falklands pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The only island bank, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands. Stanley can often also be paid with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that credit cards are not accepted on the peripheral islands, although UK and US currencies can be accepted. Check in advance with the owners to decide on an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falklands off the islands, so you change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of Ecuador, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during summer months temperatures above 30Â°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely come below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the sensation of a temperature lower than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "pious" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant all year round.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to man's sight, the fauna is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/metres from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, elk, deer, bear, practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries because they have not kept an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals an adequate space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing with you or cooking foods with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port there was the unfortunately known naval stall of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. Most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the Pacific Ocean of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
They are mostly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waitemata.
These beaches are suitable for families sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can take a bath safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have many French wines, but those Australians and New Zealanders could better face the trip.
The local tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to the Australians, the coffee 'flat white' is born from a foreign idea. The espresso' is the black short coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the same level as Belgian chocolate. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many excursions on the coral reef and the accidents for one of these causes on the coral barrier are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, follow the instructions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The cubemeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside this period they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack man. Most sharks fear him and tend to stay away.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton, not living actively in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveller has the serenity to find a place to sleep once he has reached his destination.
Travel agencies often conclude conventions with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, transfers to/from the airport or even combined flights+hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this aspect as a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action you need to arrive soon and get a space close to the music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stage, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, as ice crossings cause quite annoying noises for those who are more exposed.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include the time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are granted the visa waiver (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything to increase as much time and money as possible spent by their guests. Generally, there are no windows, no clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer food, drinks and exclusive entertainment to keep the mood of guests up so they can hold back.
In some places alcoholic drinks are offered from the house. However, the state of drunkenness alters the ability to judge and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who chooses to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice or near-zero temperatures.
On frozen and snowy carriages, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as when you are on the clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, in a very short time it can fall so much snow to keep you stuck.
Even precipitation and snow rivets, or ice formation or condensation on vehicle windows, can reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to run almost continuously throughout the year.
The safari are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the focus of many visitors' holidays.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips on the ground, especially in the savanna, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so a normal equipment is enough to get a good look.
Lions, ghepards and leopards are sometimes timorous and for this reason you can observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "walking safari", or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th 2012, and part of the events will take place in other locations scattered for Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics. The first Olympics were held in 1964.
If your reservation for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary among them, but most of the cancellation policies related to the coronavirus, at the end of March 2020, do not reach until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of much of the tickets for events will be between 2,500 Â¥ and 130,000 Â¥, while normal tickets will cost around 7,000 Â¥.
Stretching wet clothes can make it easier to dry. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you don't have a iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try with a hair dryer, if you have it at your disposal.
Be careful not to subject the tissues to too high temperatures, to avoid restrictions or, in the worst case, burns.
There are several ways to clean up water, and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, for this reason in case of doubts it is appropriate to evaluate the purchase of water packaged inside sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not widespread in their regions of origin.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation or, in the worst case scenario, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people with force are not usually qualified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy tax-free and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one with the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas between the vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, it is recommended to keep your eyes open, as they predominate steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than those applied in previous and subsequent sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of mobile telephony service is much higher than that present in other sections of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of neighbouring Austria more south.
Fruitcakes are an inertible classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Most popular cakes are often accompanied very well by a strong cup of coffee.
Those who want to taste sweets small but rich in flavor, you can orient themselves on those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be presented both "dry" and "wet", depending on the quantity of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan, curry in hinterland regions is usually used; in southern India and some other coastal region of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally indicates foods originating in the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
The Japanese cuisine, now widely distributed throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Japanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but can present safety problems for the possibility that the rider's feet will remain stuck.
If a fan is thrown out by a horse but has a foot stuck in the staff, it could be dragged away by the horse running. To minimize this risk, there are some security measures that can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots equipped with heel and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Later on, some saddles, especially the English saddles, have inserted safety bars, which cause a leather frame to be removed from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
CochamÃ³ Valley: Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs are stuck.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Scalators from every part of the world continually trace new paths on its walls, potentially infinite.
Snow sports in free descent, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very widespread and provide snow slides thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski booms" (the skiers), who devote entire holiday periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle at the base of the ski is very ancient: the first rock paintings with the representation of humans that go down date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as sport had its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Ski hiking: the activity is also called off-road skiing, mountaineering or hiking on skis.
It is connected, even if it does not usually include them, to skiing touring or skiing, which are practiced on rocky terrain and require much more rigid skis and shoes.
Think of the ski trail as a path similar to that of hiking.
If the conditions are good, you can cover distances in some way greater than those walking paths, but only very rarely you will reach the cross-country ski speeds without a heavy backpack on beaten slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but formed by many independent countries. Normally, to travel through more countries you would need to apply for a visa and pass through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions rather as a single country.
If you stay inside this area, you can normally go from one border to the other without having to cross passport controls again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual Member States, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes a fabric a piece of antique. Some tax agencies consider it an object that is at least 100 years old.
The definition presents geographical differences compared to the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft objects could be defined as antiques, even if more recent than similar articles produced in series.
The breeding of the reindeer is an important source of livelihood for the SÃ¡mi and the culture on which this trade rests is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all SÃ¡mi were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding; some lived in fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer especially as working animals.
Today many SÃ¡mi carry out modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in SÃ¡mmi, the territory of the SÃ¡mi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a travel warning should be issued for the destination you will visit, there may be consequences on your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The notices are simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simple compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression indicating any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, severe social distress or loss of human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur in every part of the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong bursts of wind, hails, precipitation above normal and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to storms, tornado, sea trumpets and cyclones.
Among the meteorological phenomena of strong regional and seasonal intensity are the torments, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to learn about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may affect travel planning.
Anyone who plans to visit a country that is potentially considered a war zone must support vocational training.
Searching on the Internet 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally deal with all the issues discussed here in a much more detailed manner, usually using practical experience.
A course normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role games, as well as many training activities on first aid and sometimes on weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are distributed, while there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers who are planning surgery to change sex abroad must make sure they have the valid return travel documents with them.
Governments' intention to issue passports without indications of sex (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Security inspections have also become much more thorough in the post-September 11, 2001.
Preoperative transgender people should not expect to pass the controls without their privacy and dignity being attacked.
The currents of ripple are constituted by the flow of return of the waves that break on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most of the dead survive because of fatigue in attempting to swim countercurrent, which may prove impossible.
As soon as you get out of the power, going back to swimming won't be more difficult than normal.
Try to find an area where you don't risk being trapped again, or evaluate if you wait for help, according to your abilities and if you've been sighted.
The shock to return manifests itself in a shorter time than the cultural shock (since we are a smaller "moon of honey" phase), it lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt to the culture of their country of origin.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will be adapted to the new culture and you will have lost some of the uses of your original culture.
In the first experience abroad, it is likely that you have met people patient and understanding, aware that travellers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness were also necessary for those who returned to their homeland.
The show of sounds and lights of the pyramid is the more interesting there is in the area for children.
Before the beginning of the show, you will be able to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The show of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the boiler of a volcano still active filled with water from origin to a magnificent natural port.
The land of Ellsworth is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge and form the mountains of Ellsworth, a chain of 360 km cut in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Chain, boasts the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for the mobile phone, because to call you you have to find yourself outdoors with the visual blur to the satellite.
The service is often used by sports boats, including sports boats, as well as by missions that need data and voice at a distance.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about the connection to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those who plan to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly widespread among new graduates, since they can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases registering for a course abroad in the Sabbath year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education than returning to your home country.
Registration for these educational programs usually requires payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "land of thousands of lakes" there are also thousands of islands, within lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
There is no need for a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly vast enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national pastime, where one boat is counted every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a stay of several days in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For the descent to the ground there will be no need for a separate visa (from 2009) using the on-board excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises in Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, moreover the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by plane can scare people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not dissimilar to the fears and personal adversities that many people express about other things.
For some people to understand how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can prove useful in overcoming a fear based on what is unknown, or on not having control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of company documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes larger companies use their aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies, problems arose.
On some routes, air shipments would require days for unloading and customs.
The only way to get it to you faster would be to send it as a hold baggage. And this is where you come into play, since airline regulations do not allow you to ship luggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or in business class the most obvious way is to pay off a nice amount for privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to be paid is high: in particular, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for business travel and up to eleven times the rate for those in first class!
In general, direct flights from A to B are not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines know well that there is a category of travellers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably to destination, and therefore apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau and the local language is Romanian. However also Russian is very widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that in the past has been the scene of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox religion.
Smirne is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important crossroads for transport.
The ancient town of Smirne is spread over a huge bay, surrounded by mountains and is currently a modern, evolved and active shopping centre.
Although in the city there is a more similar atmosphere to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, the buildings with glass facades and the modern shopping centers are dotted with the characteristic roofs of red tiles, the 18th century market and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a singular octagonal church.
In the sacred church, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north lies the romantic and charming town of Sintra, easily reachable. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant story of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of famous Marian apparitions all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a common grave, and has an almost incalculable meaning for an important part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or made them work to death, both Jews and not.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid distorting these places by embracing structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority are able to understand it; Spanish is known to virtually all.
However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
In the metro, the regular ads are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
The Parisians are famous for being self-centered, rude and presumptuous.
Although it is often only an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get well in Paris continues to be to behave at best, relating as a "well-behaved" (well-educated) person.This will definitely facilitate your movements.
The harsh external appearance of the Parisians will fade quickly if you unravel some good basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mainly beech, fish and fir, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a variety of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels, it has a wide variety of plant communities.
The area also hosts a wide variety of animal species and birds.
In these places there are rare species such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and cedar rooster, along with several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering their knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries make available stoles for unprepared women, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colours, you will gain a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants all the way under their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however the clothes are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts you may not feel comfortable. For men, a unique size for everyone!
Majorachin cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is made from bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
The Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments that can be found, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All the nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that is for "Lei", always start with the capital, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and additions.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantial form makes writing rather complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are spoken as it is written.
The main letters to be taken care of are c and g, since their pronunciation changes according to the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce in a different way "r" and "rr": dear means beloved, while cart means carriage.
The Persian has a relatively simple grammar and most of the times regular.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a novel language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a minimum knowledge of the Spanish language can come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Usually today premodern observers are obsolete and serve as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their golden period did not represent a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, more easily reachable than those built in modern times.
Most of the modern telescopes for research are huge structures in lost areas where weather conditions are favourable.
The admiration of cherry blossoming, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 13th century.
The concept was native to China, where the flowering of plums was preferred.
In Japan, the first celebrations for cherry blossoming were organized by the emperor only for himself and for other members of the aristocracy near the imperial court.
Plants give their best when they find themselves in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to even take "only" a specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, also collect some specimens of plants will cost you the distance from this place, without discussions.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy to turn city; you can buy virtually anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (most rarely, when the sky is serene).
Some buses also head north towards Hebron, the traditional place where the patriarchs of the Bible Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches Hebron's interior and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland water courses can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can make a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the paths of hiking trails and bike paths very well known.
Christmas is one of the most important feasts of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions related to this festival have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
A tradition is to spend the night of Easter staying awake in an outdoor place in order to admire the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations at the basis of this tradition, but it could be a very good pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the more traditional Churches a Easter Vigil is often celebrated on the Sabbath night of Easter weekend, with congregations that often start the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands reached us swimming, flying or floating.
Since the distance from the continent was considerable, mammals could not cope with the trip. This made the giant turtle become the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
At Galapagos many mammals were introduced, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats after the arrival of man.
If you visit the territories of the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, it will be possible to experience the polar night, when the sun remains under the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility to attend the boreal dawn, because the sky remains dark almost all day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the culture of work is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners tend to be accustomed.
Office clothing is normally made up of jacket and tie or tailor and is addressed to colleagues with their surname or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, since it gives importance to the group's commitment rather than to commend individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive the benefit of their superiors with regard to every decision, and we expect them to stick to the instructions without asking questions.
