White pion to f3, black pion to e6, white pion to g4, black lady to h4 - chess and mat! That's what we call by joking in the chess circles the "mat of the madman".
The whites: turn on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. The blacks: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, crazy on b8. The whites put the opponent in zugzwang by playing the turn on a6, then the blacks have only two options: take the turn on a6 or move their crazy to any other box of diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and offer failure and mat. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pawn on a7, with the same result.
