UN Chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon states that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that lasts nearly five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN Chief again requested all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said on Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present in the Council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this situation unresolved".
Ban asked the five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity shown when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 figures from the polls showing that Donald Trump has real chances
Some tried to label him as a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others await implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to beat Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it didn't work (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump drives with a two-digit percentage and some voices start to seriously wonder what this means for the real estate mogul's chances of being named.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for the nomination of Republicans.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance was in the polls for Herman Cain, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would struggle hard in the general elections are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic Club for Growth group admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
Here are a few figures from the recent surveys that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just something passing:
The figures that indicate support for Trump are back at 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage rose to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
These figures shall be maintained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the republicans in the region have a favorable opinion about Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the race for nomination.
In a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be "enthusiastic" or "thank you" if Trump won the race for nomination.
Only two out of 10 states that they would be "overwhelmed " if Trump won the race for nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say he would be "enthusiasts" compared to 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
Closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters claim that they would be "unsatisfied" or "overwhelmed" if favorite Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticized for his insults and his bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters at the national level believe that the real estate mogul has the right temper to be president, according to the poll conducted on Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same figures in Iowa State, where 52% of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to the poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% are of the opinion that it does not have the necessary personality to act effectively and almost six out of 10 independents state that its temperament does not have what it is looking for at the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, on the question of who has the most chance to win the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed compared to the end of July, when four out of ten would bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, the GOP voters have not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last elections, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the nomination race, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or turned back to another candidate, Trump is still at the forefront of everyone.
Some voices say that the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump's victory, while supporting Trump will be divided into more than twelve candidates.
But a poll conducted at the beginning of September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, almost always Trump will benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points away from Marco Rubio, 15 points away from Walker, 19 points away from Jeb Bush and finally 33 points away from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would beat the 19-point businessman in a hypothetical one-to-one confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've decided.
A new poll by CBS/NYT Tuesday shows that over half of the voters who support Trump say they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, much can happen in this sense and no one can say that they will never change.
46% say they leave the gate open to change their option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it is twice as likely that voters who declare that they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump in the immigration issue.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "violations" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration was the central subject in the campaign for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombistic style will lead to a split between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will undermine the rebranding efforts.
However, according to the poll conducted by ABC/Post on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration towards authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of Republican voters, largely because of their status as outsiders.
According to the poll carried out on Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone with experience in government.
People are also upset about Washington authorities.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of the Republicans in Congres, 54% declaring themselves "unsatisfied" and 21% "nervous at the top".
Jeremy Corbyn debuts Prime Minister's Questions
Since his choice, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions to which he is entitled shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be analysed closely by the media and Labour parliamentarians.
In the weekly appearances, he asked for "less theatre and more facts".
He also said he could give up a few participations and give them to his colleagues.
The conflict will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test in leadership position, coming after he called a "phantom cabinet" and after the speech he held on Tuesday at the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the ruling of the leader of the Labour Party to remain silent on the return of the national anthem in a job held on Tuesday during the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England attracted criticism from conservative parliamentarians and took the front page of the newspapers.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national hymn drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he "maintained his silence in a respectful manner" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England. "
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's ghost office, Owen Smith, said for the BBC broadcast Two's Newsnight that he would have recommended the Labour leader to sing the national "indifferent" hymn of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's lead team, arguing through differences of opinion related to economy, defence and external, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant states that the policy differences "accumulate" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment regarding his position vis-Ã -vis the European Union and the benefit limit.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party will bring about changes by which the idea of limitation will be completely eliminated.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that the party "is very clear" in the exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the "cap" level from Â£26,000 to Â£23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader facing David Cameron at the rostrum in the last decade, since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says that he has "outsourced" ideas for questions to be addressed to Cameron and that he has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentarian Islington North said that PMQs involve too high a level of confrontation and that it will refrain from reprisals and attacks, committing itself to focus instead on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will take her place at PMQs when he can't participate - for example when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying that he approached the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this aspect.
In 2005, when he took over, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he had failed in his endeavours.
Since the first transmission in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of the reasoning of a leader, of the way he leads the Chamber of Deputies and his position among parliamentary colleagues, although critics claim to have become a cartoon and need a profound reform.
âCadru in Joburg': Youths without shelter benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and earn their living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth to take pictures of the areas they live in and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the project's first graduates.
Chief JD Sports says that higher wages could damage the expansion
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, states that an increase in minimum wage in the UK could mean "a greater purchasing power in potential consumer pockets."
However, that purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs within the firm, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the "fort" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior is worth words of praise rather than criticism, in the opinion of President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was unwelcomely dragged into the spotlight by the scandalous slip that Kyrgios had in front of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a qualifying cranium game played shortly afterwards, in Cincinnati, the chair referee had to intervene twice to break up Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have put Kyrgyos down, and I should have put this kid down."
Although he was last seen making a dust rocket after having muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he fights Sam Groth for second place in the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the semifinal of the Davis Cup against England.
"One thing I feel strong about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little drawn to the conflict," Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a frustration missile against himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of it.
But let's be serious, he's mastered himself extremely well in pretty provocative situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of confidence.
He's got an amazing team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, working hard and integrated into the team, had no conflict with the other players, he is very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in an excellent form, he is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and defects.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the major remittance match, which begins on Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most suitable for everyone, but supported the return of the player from Canberra on a long-term team.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the remise game and not to think at all about the controversy around it [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick came up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he matured under the public eye and made some terrible mistakes and deserved to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs a time when he's not in the spotlight to be able to reflect, which is good for both the team and for him.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Bernie Sanders has been halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for candidacy at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins the ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down from 58%) while Sanders is in second place, 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether to run for president, is supported by 15% of the Democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most Democrats say it's too early to say that they've decided on the candidate they're going to support.
But Clinton's supporters are firmer in their choice than other candidates' supporters.
Faced with the CBS news poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has been reduced.
Men's support was considerably reduced and Sanders was only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among democrats under the age of 50 has evaporated, now being equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still at the forefront of senior voters.
Last month, Clinton stood in front of Sanders, with a two-digit percentage among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a slight advantage of 5 points in this group.
Approximately half of national democrat voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she had chosen to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters will be enthusiastic about her choice is high.
The opinions are more mixed up among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support it.
While 48% of the Democrats say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same thing about the first class, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would like to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that it is time for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
Given that the Vice-President is considering a possible candidate for the presidency, 57% of the Democrats and would like to see him running - although a third think he should not run.
On the question of the second option for the party's representative, the Democrats call Biden a majority.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half said Biden would be the second option, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic Party race, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders grows, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of the Democrats consider Clinton the candidate with the greatest chances of winning the general elections; but the figures have fallen from 78% in the past month.
Biden is at a distance in the second place, but the percentage according to which he is the most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to a chosen candidate, democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well with regard to some key features vis-Ã -vis their party's primary voters.
Most voters regard Clinton, Sanders and Biden as integrity and trust and having strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best seen of all three with respect to integrity, while Clinton's strong point is leadership.
30% of the Democrats do not believe that H. Clinton is integrated and confident, twice as much as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion on him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
Regarding all these aspects, about a quarter of the democrat voters do not have an opinion on Sanders.
As the questions persist with regard to the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton while he was Secretary of State, most democrats are satisfied with his explanation of the subject and say that he did not affect their general view of the candidate.
But things are different for the American public.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion was divided in March on this subject, shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that the email dispute did not affect their general view of Clinton, although 36% say they changed their view in the negative.
Mostly the Republicans, more than six out of ten, say they changed their mind about Clinton in the negative.
Although the Democrats consider Clinton to be integrity and trust, this aspect continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% consider it to be integrity and trust, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it to be integrity and trust.
At the same time, 55% of voters at the national level do not regard Trump as integrity and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates assessed, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in integrity.
The number of those who regard Sanders as integrity is greater than those who do not feel the same, but as in Carson's case, many do not think about him.
The margin of error for the 351 sample of primary democrat voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the brother charged with murdering the student in year 1 at Baruch College
Almost two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
The members of the Fr. Pi Delta Psi of the Baruch Faculty of New York brutally attacked Chun "Michel" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
The official sources say that the victim was blindfolded, a 14 kg bag full of sand was put behind him and he was repeatedly abrupted as he tried to head towards a target, on an ice-cream field.
Mr. Deng accused the headaches after which he lost consciousness.
The members of the brother Pi Delta Psi did not call the emergency number after he fainted and claimed that he would have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, the police say.
But they found the time to change Deng's clothes, look for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the brother at the national level, to ask for advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this time, members began to hide personal goods and put the good of brotherhood in practice before Michael Deng's good," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, trunks and thighs.
"Many families have been devastated by brotherly rituals since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, in a statement.
Their brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe District Grand Jury recommended that the first five members be charged with a third degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be indicted for outrage and complicity in murder.
"We want to take responsibility not only for the people involved but, if there is an organisation that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will also take responsibility for it," Wagner said on Tuesday at a press conference.
The Baruch faculty banned the fraternity and the national brotherhood withdrew its membership with the local representation.
Here's what's going to happen when the Federal Reserve increases interest rate
The interest rate will increase and the bull market (growing market) will shrink, bond profitability will increase and the economy will fall.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's going to happen and how long it's going to take.
In the economy, history offers few clues about time frame..
After the first increase in interest rate, the recession took place in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggression of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
Therefore, US central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on the time when interest rates are beginning to increase but on the trajectory of the time needed for standardisation.
Indeed, in the game there are multiple variables.
In the end, however, players on the market may find that all the turmoil related to the increase in interest rate has been exaggerated.
"The first increase in the interest rate decided by Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the "cheap money" era," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal levels but still small to constitute the seismic shock that all seem to fear.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
We continue to present how some sectors of the economy could react, relying on historical trends:
Given the situation with which the market has faced in recent months, anticipating the increase in interest rate can volatilize things for a while.
But, at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a tendency for capital profitability to stagnate for 12-24 months after first growth, which may reflect again the gap in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after Fed growth.
More precisely, in the last 35 years, the market has suddenly increased - by about 14 percent - heading towards increasing the interest rate, quite invariable during the 250 days after (mean increase of 2.6%), after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the chief strategy of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche stated that the impact on actions tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits are beginning to fall.
The recession is a reality of economic life but increasing interest rate often contributes to it.
In the present situation, Fed faces conditions that have not existed before and could speed up a recession.
More precisely, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increasing interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing all year for a Fed growth decision, all eyes being focused on this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economists are of the opinion that the FOMC could approve an increase in interest rate at the time of this meeting, forward-term transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study after 1950, all cycles of interest rate growth to date have been in a super cycle of profit growth, with GDP overshadowing the peaks before the very rapid recession after the start of recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strange slow recovery after the worst recession of the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by Fed since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income has also been volatile since the market anticipates an increase in interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster for bonds than for shares when Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, the benefits seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, bond profitability drops immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategies are of the opinion that these interest rate increases will lead to the proximity of profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
Obligations with high profitability do better in such an environment, although "we are still cautious about the strength of profitability", Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst in Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed's expectations.
"Besides the power of the dollar and the fall in inflation, there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, profitability curve is more fair, the spread of the average interest rate of credit has expanded and volatility has increased - all the features of the market when Fed tightens policy.
Largely speaking, companies operating mostly in the U.S. will have to gain from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the increase in the dollar will lead to the price of their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that "quality" stocks tend to be more profitable in the next three months of an initial increase in interest rate," Goldman Sachs said in a customer report.
Firms with strong balance sheets exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital receipts and low-volatile stocks also exceeded similar companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Duty will become a major problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, says Goldman.
Consumers will also have won the dollar increase.
Those who save could also have won, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, says parliamentarian Andrew Bingham
Conservative parliamentarian Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for "prosecuting"
It states that it is becoming more and more similar to the commercial opponent
He also took a look at BBC Music Awards, claiming that they plagiarismed the Brits Awards.
Damien Collins' colleague attacked The Voice, claiming that this show is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 "transforms into" Classic FM, said an important parliamentarian, putting pressure on him to prove that he does something that commercial posts do not do.
Conservative parliamentarian Andrew Bingham also told the BBC chiefs that the public radio station "protests" and looks more and more like the commercial opponent.
"I have the impression that Radio 3 "protests" - although I don't like to use the word - but I have the impression that it turns into Classic FM," he said.
He also took a look at BBC Music Awards, released last year in December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seem to be Brits under another name.
So, if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come into my mind that just copy what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
BBC Director General denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent in live music and public education.
I'm not gonna find out anywhere about the classical music I know from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important that Radio 3 is committed to discovering new music and allocating new songs," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he must make more efforts to attract the audience than the previous period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under BBC criticism during the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport because it would follow the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative parliamentarian Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for the sum of approximately Â£22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that issue because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having Paloma Faith and Boy George on the jury - be performed "in a specific BBC manner."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find the golden-egged chicken in its own ograd" next time he launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban in the future the taking of new seasons of The Voice or to spend the money that goes on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded the lowest increase in August and guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
In the last month, there has been the slowest growth since 2000 to date.
Online sales took place three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phone to make purchases.
Specialists are of the opinion that November's Black Friday could lead to a reluctance to spend.
Over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned British shopping streets into ghost cities.
Specialists say, however, that there are signs that online sales are shrinking, the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total money spent in August has shown the lowest growth since 2000 to date, with only 5% growth in the last year.
Specialists say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we look at the level of growth in previous years and return to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor at the IMRG sales index, for the Guardian.
He explained that online sales got ahead three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phone to shop.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and do it under different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it's slowing down a little, you could see a drop (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers got stuck in front of computers to get their hands on deals, which led to the collapse of multiple retail sites.
Specialists are of the opinion that Black Friday, when the buyers beat on the slips, could determine the reluctance of the buyers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least Â£1 out of every Â£5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to use fashion shops in commercial areas.
After sanctioning the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed following the collapse of the Mecca macara
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked on the streets by Muslims, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partially blamed the giant in Saudi Binladin Group construction for collapse.
Minister of Health stated that a total of 394 people were injured following the macara collapse
In the street walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a macaroni collapsed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who complained about their deaths joined the road to express their condolences, until the first dead reached the end of the final journey, at the Al-Moassem cemetery.
The sad reminder kept from the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction macara collapsed through the mosque's ceiling, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the Bin Laden family's construction group for the disaster, which also soldiered with 394 wounded.
In the street ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a macaroni collapsed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims were the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Mannester, who was in his first pilgrimage when the macara collapsed.
Mr. Akram is in the Great Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the arm of the macara lifted when the macara was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi press agency, stated that the Binladin Group partially bears the blame for the collapse.
The English service of the news agency did not present that detail, but stated that the company's leaders were prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the macara collapse in the yard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Hajj pilgrimage that took place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the macaroni and the representatives of the Group could not be contacted for the declarations.
The Royal Decree blamed the group because it did not use updated safety measures and did not coordinate its work with the meteorological authorities.
Tens of cranes surround the Sea Mosque of Mecca, as part of the massive effort of construction led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with Saudi Arabia's royal family and is carrying out major construction projects.
The last Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegade" son, inherited by the family in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in strong wind and rain conditions, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in the life of every physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say that 158 people stay in the hospital.
The authorities have decided that the relatives of the deceased victims will receive a million Saudi Riali (174,000 pounds) and the same amount will be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of credit conversion in Swiss francs
In the banking market, there have already been two offers of conversion into the lei of credit in Swiss francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable interest can lead to increased rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of converting loans into French granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the offer of conversion for its customers.
According to cumulative data from FinZoom financial portal analysts, Bancpost offers three years of fixed lei interest, of 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the conversion offer of the Transylvania Bank was accepted by 83% of clients with loans in French due to the second successive reductions: the balance was reduced with the value of the risk and administration commissions paid by the client, then an additional 22.5% reduction was applied to the balance in the lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their customers, compared to the equivalent monthly platform in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5% and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the next few years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the cover in the lei of credits in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected by future increases of the franc, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which he cashs his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that the property is not re-assessed, additional guarantees are no longer required, and another proof of revenue is required.
Basically, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit and no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offer discount at the monthly rate, compared to the customer tray before conversion, equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is formed more of the interest, and the client pays very little of the principal.
The Bancpost offer with very small interest in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
It is not known how this interest will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be more than 3.25%, so in total, and the cost reduction is smaller.
A possible risk for all lei loans with variable interest is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly in the following years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached a value of 6%, in 2009, at more than 15%, and in a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to defend other costs, unministered in the original offer.
The time has come for decisions on the interest rate for the US Federal Reserve
The world looks at the scheduled meeting in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make a crucial decision whether or not to increase interest rate for the first time after about a decade.
In a poll conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, a little over half that last week believed that the decision would be taken, I now believe that the situation will be maintained for a while and that interest rates will be kept within the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are faced with a situation where a major central bank could give up the zero rate and initiate a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, recovering by bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
However, the Federal Reserve must not ignore the overall situation less pink.
He warned markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
See who's lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, in front of cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor would have faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly has a cost.
Player Luke Shaw of Manchester United is on the stand for a few months because of double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture at his right leg in the Manchester United Champions League match, ended with a defeat in front of PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and will hold him on for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred following a reckless intervention by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute, after Shaw, 20 years of age, broke the PSV defense.
He received medical attention for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he went to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture on his leg and is in the hospital. "
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow, then he'll be operated in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18 years old, encounters difficulties, then plays fantastic and now something like that happens.
His oxygen mask was put in the locker room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but at double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Looks like Moreno got lucky and got rid of the red cardboard and the concession of a punishment blow.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge alone when I say it's fault and red cardboard.
It was a very ugly, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, I start my way to recovery, I will come back stronger. "
Similar news: Manchester United hit by the accident of Luke Shaw defeating PSV
The founder of the England team has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, a PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad accident. "
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players never watch an opponent crash.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico's national against the Dutch national led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very hard for him because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious accident, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I only managed to see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In the SBS6 statement, Moreno said: "I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to go through this.
I feel bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player AndrÃ©s Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England's omission but he's still holding fast
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not take into consideration a repetition of defeat by 3-0 in the test matches.
I wouldn't eliminate the variant of a moving victory.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good spin players in the beating line and collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive youthful attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as spinner and Adil Rashid, even if unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Similar topics: Adam Lyth left England's team for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his senior coach in Yorkshire, it's difficult for me to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven test matches against two good attackers in difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no questions about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said that before - the players are their own selections.
About fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope if he does more rounds for Yorkshire, he'll have other opportunities.
The main coach of England's team, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when his performance was not commensurate with his ability and I am not surprised by this; first of all, he is a team man.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the test matches.
Lyth had seven rounds - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton was lucky at home and on the move.
The only displeasure you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott on the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in the highest form - but that missed opportunity is the domain of the past.
Alex Hales is on the team, a batsman I see very well.
He's a cricket player who has the "X factor" and I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will of course depend on the composition of the team in the EAU.
The idea was launched that Moeen would open the fight with Cook, which would lead to extra spinner keeping four quicks at the same time, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a thrower couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already shown that he's fucked up.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was number three for these, so the difference isn't great.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test 38 games as a first drop before he opened in 2001.
He immediately wiped out three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes on the team on the back-up spinner position and, although I had limited contact with him, it struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his early age - with an average of 31 at the beat and 35 at the ball - and they might think it's point, but there's not a lot of spinners and selectors have opted for youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tour.
England has also made some changes to the coach team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, batsman from Sri Lanka, as consultant for the test matches could be a master's shot.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he has played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball league of the tournament and will bring both energy and uncrossing ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in the international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if they transmit messages that have been transmitted and previously, can bring fresh air into the team.
Colly Durham's teammate, Ben Stokes rests for one-day matches, Root has received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.
Although not all agree, coaches and selectors don't do the program.
And you have to hold back, the players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions never take easy.
Camp Brexit could win the cause if the economy remains calm by 2017
The day goes by, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep the UK in the EU gets harder and harder, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Yes or no?" Corbyn in the leadership of the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism Tuesdays to Europe.
Strangers also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained in the past days that - plunged into crises similar to that of the EU - not all being provoked internally - some Member States are fed with the Great Britain's agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that they would not want this either if they were to erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's "selfie" agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attends meetings or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with an external perspective under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that several ministers and officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German chancellor, is an ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation settles, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who stayed too long.
In 2017, French President FranÃ§ois Hollande will be real or replaced.
And his power is declining.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain one left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English who picture, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - a thing they do not want either because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers could even plan to intentionally make remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
âRenegotiation has been fixed' and âGreat Britain has not obtained any value from renegotiation'.
Europeans know on their skin how captivating Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the barons of the oligarchic press who look at the EU with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in relation to 2:1.
Perhaps he remembers Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a correspondent in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of unpaid tax bags, foreigners who fraudulently phoned and pseudo-non-domestic who hold most of the important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them about the same, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage with a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from thinking about eating at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by the French and Dutch voters in 2005, which offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me on the back Monday at Westminster - I told him not to waste his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting out of the way the Murdoch boycott strategy of Neil Kinnock from the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may last, but it must develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but with certainty with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left a Sunday holiday.
Corbyn's official position vis-Ã -vis Europe is what I would call indulgence evolution.
It states that it would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with conservative "anglicism " might agree with that.
This said Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when his researcher fought not to admit that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as the shadow minister on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on TV to be unhappiness to fellow laborers, without going too far and without losing his job in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said or what JC said to colleagues and parliamentarians during the private meeting of Monday night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey - withheld, raised my awareness - the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television and especially in the age of social networks, a focal point of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a favor in Europe, allowing him to take good support for the workers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbyin's basic sophism about EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esotheric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in the case of his NATO sophism - Tom Watson is unthinkable about the fact that JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed about the weak military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that cuts costs, as I was reminded to launch British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticise the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the statements of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them related to the tobacco industry.
Specialists in the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet's publication in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of evidence."
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed their finger at the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the "extraordinary base of frailty" which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in the BMJ questioned their claims and their rationale "on solid soil or moving sand".
Martin McKee, European Professor of Public Health at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They claimed that PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting involving 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the negative effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past for an independent study.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 meeting participants reported funding received from an electronic cigarette manufacturer but not funding on which there are reports that they would have received it from the cigarette and tobacco company, Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected have not been provided, but among them are a few "faunties" known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of which even state in the work the financing of the industry.
Other meeting participants are not known for expertise in tobacco control.
The head of the tobacco control department of the PHE also participated in the meeting.
The group's research work "facilitates convincingly" the lack of "solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have on the majority of the criteria," McKee and Capewell said.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell stated that PHE claims that "to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of the Health Department of the PHE, states that he has responded in the past to BMJ's allegations.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of two people who smoked their whole life loses their lives because of this vice.
All evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic cigarettes to health is lower compared, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that emerges and the information that does not emerge from the evidence, particularly in view of the high degree of public confusion about the dangers relative to tobacco.
Annually, about 80,000 people lose their lives due to a disease associated with smoking and the annual costs borne by the national health system due to smoking amount to Â£2 billion.
Expressing clearly the current evidence - that although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risks, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfil our national duty.

Claims that shame Britain's arms trade
Follow Amnesty International's film against the arms fair.

The joyful voice and animated images do not doubt that this commercial for the world's largest arms fair is an arduous sarade, made by Amnesty International to underline the desire of the British authorities to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at ExCel Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also led to the posting of a large number of posters in bus stations and subways that need a second look.
"Important announcement, do you travel with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London metro, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will be born on the DLR Clients are asked to contribute to stopping the arms deal.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited their works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a six-pound Allen key package that states that it "facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in the bus stations on the planet."
London's transport region is not entertained by this "vandalism " in the form of wheels.
One of the parody announcements produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are moving towards collaborating with activists in protest movements, realizing that they need to go out into the real world so that their art will have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that greets the commuters who travel by metro.
Amnesty's film had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
The creation director of the VCCP, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the commercial for the arms fair - with an empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the realization of a more realistic commercial but "enriching it with powerful animations and colors, it was more dazzling".
"They've done a great job helping us to increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, the UK authorities would need to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the theme of the arms fair comes from inside ExCel, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order received from the US Army concerning "AT4CS RS with shoulder-support launcher."
This includes "a single-shaped foci that offers amazing effects behind the armor inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules to live in the home
It's been 11 years since I moved to my home, while I was a 19-year-old, who still believed in beers and moral relativity, but I barely now remember the forced smiles of those I annoy - and the many complaints about others.
Most of the things I've learned can be summarized in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving to the home can bring conditions that vary from nervous breakdown to horror.
The chatter is tempting: to tell people where you're from, if and where you spent a year of study break, what do you think about Corbyn and why "surely, you're indifferent to Marmite because, for the good guys, it's nothing other than extract of Hahaha's drojdie, you find me in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others breathe - ask questions and show interest.
They encourage conversation and help you differentiate people you like from those you wouldn't even talk to if the flood came and they were the only ones who would have boats.

Introverts are part of special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a refuge, but in many homes a culture of bedroom perforation is built, based on friendship, socialization and friends that last all their lives.
All of this can be terrible for someone who's trying to load their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want to be friends, but I want you to leave to recover my energy that I have consumed by interacting with you."

Since you start the university in Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to make acquaintance and take a black plate, it seems less strange, less like the situation in the 1950s, "We came to the neighborhood, I cooked you something, now smile and I ask personal questions."
The nice ones prepared in the house are a great way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel compelled to talk and may get to associate your figure with a tasty surprise.
Obviously, you must be a good cook.
Flour, sugar and fat shells will most likely cause others to pretend that they sleep when you knock at the door.

If someone steals your things, it's annoying and I understand you - still try to tackle the problem more mature than my roommate, who colored his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole.
He's in jail now.
Don't make noise that doesn't let others sleep or study.
That's not just because he's got a good sense, but because you're going to his own stubble.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to give the music a little slower because it was 3:00 a.m. and she had a morning exam.

Violonist David Grimal: In Bach's time there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less ordinary project, to be entitled "curious", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra formed by international soloists and talented musicians, who interpret a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and this makes it at least a curiosity in the classical musical landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two shows: a representation, Sunday, in which soloist was David Grimal, founder of the orchestra, and one month, when in the foreground was the violinist Xavier Phillips, the works composed by Enescu being nelipsitis.
Both performances, performed on the scene of Athens, showed the public another way to play classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at that time, the only classical musical ensemble in which there is no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It's true, on the one hand musicians need education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - talking about instrumentalists, not composers.
They're formed as "specialized warriors".
They still have the impression that they need a leadership.
On the other side of the stage, for the public, all the music fetishing focuses on the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, it's marketing itself.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So, if we look at this world, we have on the one hand skilled workers, which is stupid, and a public that can't listen, but must look, which is stupid again," considers David Grimal.
The violinist tells us that this change in the way he makes music came after the "musical deceptions" of his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to win a lot of money and to bring money and music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was around 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So, I've never found any meaning to continue on this road.
So I decided to create the Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one would do such a thing without a conductor: "The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects".
"How do I imagine you marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no ego?" asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of existence of the ensemble, the absence of a conductor has not proved to be a catch in the musical act: "Curiously, as we sing a more complex repertoire, it seems so simple, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not only in the role", says Grimal, adding that at the Sunday show "we were 74 conductors on the stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave", precisely because it invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where there are the greatest orchestras in the world that sings and 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, as is the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest for something different, breaking barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so that he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal is campaigning to change the way classical music education is done, considering that "the music messeria, as it is organized today, has an iz of death" and that "the future of music represents the music itself".
We don't need to do the world tour five times a year if it's no good.
In Bach's time there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, the organization of concerts, festivals, tournaments, the release of albums are all formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system in which creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To enter the EU, you had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture come into the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
With music happening the same thing, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes the reds may not be too beautiful, but when we cut them, they are the real reds.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese do - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce his teaching in school, we reintroduce concerts to television and through this education we no longer need to sell musical by-products," Grimal believes.
Surely, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, before all, a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it is entirely different.
After your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asked the French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes just from exceeding this status of "soldier", exceeding what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and that's why after the concert they come out scavengers".
David Grimal talked about the project or musical and about his vision of music and the artist at the "Idea Festival", a discussion with the audience organized at the George Enescu International Festival by the Romanian Aspen Institute.
Profile David Grimal

Cinema City is looking for "The Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: doubling two characters in the superproduction "Craisa ZÄpezii 3D"
Do you have a super-talented, spontaneous kid who likes movies?
Give her the chance to become a star.
In September, in the new campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to reach future stars and between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Small Big Voices", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters in a famous animation film.
If the classical drawings put emphasis on approaching the voice of the actor to the specific character animated, in the last period, the creation of the story also takes into consideration those who are to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are launching an unpublished campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enroll their children in our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the replicas are funny.
"The kids will have fun and a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, from September 11 to September 30, Cinema City organizes a pre-election after which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be chosen who will have the opportunity to give a test in a recording studio with professionals.
All the parents have to do is access the small levocimari.cinema-city.ro platform, where they can register the child for the competition and prepare him for the voice test.
Then, you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then, the child will register by playing his own double version.
Four films about friendship, fairy heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the trial: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Moune: Guardian of the 3D Moon", "Blinky Bill: Koala the 3D poser" and "Albinuta Maya 3D".
Finally, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and will double one character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Craiasa ZÄpezii 3D", who will have the premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx wins are mixed, tax forecast drops for 2016
FedEx said disappointing results for the last quarter, the giant in the field of deliveries reducing profit estimates for the whole year as a result of low demand for transport services and higher costs for its land transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares decreased by approximately 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of the Wednesday opening bell.
FedEx Corp. stated that it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of next year, with 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts predicted $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The downward estimate comes in spite of the increase in prices by 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and the larger surcharges for the land transport of large or large packages, which will apply from November.
The company stated that it is still expected to increase its earnings from the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
President and Director-General Fred Smith said that "signature faces a considerably weaker economic situation than is expected, in particular in terms of global production and trade."
The employee plans during the holiday period were announced one day after the UPS competitor stated that it intends to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, approximately the same number of hirings he made last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx won $692 million, with 6% more than the previous year.
The winnings per action were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 per action made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit grew by 5%, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in Zacks' survey estimated the amount of $12.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to the stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has caught the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the income of the ground division increased by 29%, but operational income practically stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher basic tariffs, while the revenues recorded by the freight division decreased due to rising costs.
At the pre-market transaction, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares dropped by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
Tuesdays closed down by 11% at year level and by 17% compared to the peak record recorded on June 11.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meetings in recent years, those responsible for policy development in the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-foot mahon Honduran meal to decide whether it is time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at the end of the central bank's meeting room, a wall painting of the United States will be maintained.
The map is meant to remind that Janet L. Yellen, President Fed, and his colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above everything else.
The Central Bank has received a dual task from the Congress: to maximise the employment rate in the US and to maintain price stability.
But since the big economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is prepared to be stripped of the unprecedented stimulus offered by the close-to-zero short-term interest rate in effect since the end of 2008.
Even if most data indicate a strong growing economy, recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already cautious about adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects they will pursue," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I believe that if they were to look for an excuse not to increase interest rate, the growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait," she said.
There is no consensus as to the decision that Fed will take, which in itself causes instability on the financial market.
Approximately half of the recently asked Bloomberg economists anticipated an increase in interest rate this week.
But the financial markets expect Fed to decrease, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a drop on the stock exchange if Fed increased interest rate, unless policy makers mitigated the blow by promising that it would pass a long time to the next increase.
Tuesday, industrial average Dow Jones climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16.599.85.
The boost was triggered by expectations that Fed decision makers will maintain the interest rate stable this week, said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising for Fed to increase interest rate at this time," Lonski said.
If the Fed decision makers would do this, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets."
Other experts said an increase in interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when Fed would act.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slow tightening monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that he is expecting an increase in interest rate this year despite the high objections of liberals such as that he would need more economic progress.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth was solid this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Wages showed signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fail to reach the annual target of the central bank, the Fed decision-makers said that a key reason was the temporary effect of sudden decline in oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the pressure on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to enter fibrillations at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
Industrial media Dow Jones dropped by 16% below the peak peak reached in May, as investors feared that slowing the Chinese economy would bring down global growth.
The market dropped somewhat this month, with the Dow index now being about 10% below the peak of May.
For Fed decision-makers, market turmoil is added to the complex calculation of the interest rate growth moment.
"Without what has happened in the financial markets and the news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be firmer in the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, researcher with experience at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now, he expects that they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy and almost no data to be based on subsequent events in China," Oliner said.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so it should not practically be taken into account when making decisions.
But in reality, Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been huge.
The President's simple allusion since then, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that the Fed could "strange" its monetary expansion triggered earthquakes on world markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly engulfed, Fed officials are expected not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the Global Strategy Department of the Envestnet Wellness Management Company Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "Fed has a history of oversized reaction to changes in the financial market that seem to be unrelated to economic bases."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Commission for the Open Market, a decision-making body that supported the increase in interest rate, offered as an example the decisions of 1998-99.
A financial crisis that affected Asia led Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite the implications of limited identification for US development," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials came back on those falls.
Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The last troubled period does not rise far at that level, he said.
"We certainly don't want to get into the situation of fear of an increase in interest rate because the markets were upset," said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to hold the double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something is changed in this regard, I do not think that premature action should be taken.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite the attempts of the Nine Channel to broadcast in Today Show about changing party leadership
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's urgent move to Canberra to convey on the subject the consequences of the changes from the Liberal Party leadership did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of the Nine channel transmitted from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing Sunrise broadcast, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was captured in London as part of a series of broadcasts over a few weeks, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Cascade and Cancun.
This "cruzime" of distance did not seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today has seen a slight increase compared to Monday's hearings (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but the figures were lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the difference from Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
For the time being, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
This morning, not only is Parliament affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the question!

The main news was the amazing debut of the 800 Words series featuring the former star of Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, having as its subject a widowed father who decides to move along with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to face a show alone, without the star of Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
The results of the hearing for the last night answered a lot as "yes".
Seven's X Factor show was held in position with 1,136 million viewers, taking the appearance of The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded raids and descents on the second night he broadcast The Chase Australia.

The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) went up to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The fall of the hearing recorded by Chase Australia on the second night will give silent confidence to Nine that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to win McGuire's show.

4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at Nepalese protesters
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, one officer said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of district police, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal stated that police forces used tear gas after which they fired shots into the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not clear immediately why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the last event after weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern region, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group claimed that the new province founded under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests also existed in West Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent clashes on 10 August,
when four major political parties signed an agreement for the country's division into the provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial problem in Nepal, a centrally governed country for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, the legislators voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and the officials said that the new card could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns.

We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or gun cops.
"It's a shame for the 21st century to apply methods." Victor Ponta said.
"The Prime Minister further said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established in the CSAT meeting on Thursday." the Prime Minister concluded.

A large low pressure front at about 560 km south of the southernmost point of Cape Verde Islands has a 60% chance of turning into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Centre said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low pressure front approximately halfway between Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles also presents a 60% probability of formation of a tropical cyclone in the next two days, added the meteorologist in Miami.
Weight reduction surgery could be useful for diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight reduction surgery for people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabetics with mild obesity live longer after the surgery of weight loss than those following non-surgical treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, called bariatric surgery, use different methods to reduce the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people with soft obesity with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
BMI, a weight measurement unit in relation to height, is considered normal in the 18.5-24.9 range.
The BMI of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and persons with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used the data gathered after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and stomach gastrectomy in the cuff - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with mild obesity.
Mean BMI in those who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received non-surgical treatments against diabetes remained almost at the same level, i.e. 29.
Of those who had surgery, diabetes was completely cured at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured at only 1% and partially at only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol" were generally better in the surgical group, " concluded the authors.
Researchers also monitored the blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the level of blood glucose over time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of A1c haemoglobin is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, it remained at about 8%.
However, this improved "glycaemic control" - reflected by improved levels of A1c haemoglobin - did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to Chief Investigator Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the gastrectomy group in the manxon, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), experienced more significant decreases in BMI (74 versus 5.1) and A1c haemoglobin (3.1% versus 2.1%) and had a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study carried out on people with high weight in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from Arizona University, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery were approximately 29% less likely to die after 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit for patients who had surgery, Blackstone stated that it is an optimistic aspect for people with BMI under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is the point where this work is critical because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group", without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously then the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long until we urge people to take this seriously," she said.
I think once they accumulate these genetic changes that shorten their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader sent a call to end the violence in the refugee mother countries.
Dalai Lama spoke about the current problem of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the face of the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
He also stressed that, although admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It's wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but we need to think at the same time about long-term solutions to bring honest peace and development, especially through education, to Muslim countries," he said.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attacks on 11 September, claiming that the violent response from the US generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this issue without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to Georgia's poison control centre, the U.S. poison control centres have reported an increase of approximately 400% since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age who have swallowed hand detergents with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of Georgia's Anti-Oiling Centre, cases of ingestion of hand detergent in children under 12 years of age reported in anti-Oiling centres rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"The kids have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them reach the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said that some children drink detergent intentionally and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
On YouTube can be watched movies that introduce teenagers as they drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It looks like teenagers mixed the detergent with alcohol to get a better drink.
Smaller children can be attracted to the attractive smell of detergent.
"A child doesn't think he's hurting him," Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergents) are perfumed ones.
Hand detergents with strawberry flavor, grape, orange are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially for young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, Medical Director of the Anti-Otraviral Center at Kansas University Hospital, for the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested at school the equivalent of four hand sprays with strawberry flavor, reached the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcohol179, twice as much as the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor at the emergency room who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was joking and couldn't go when he got to the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage, because the girl fell and hit her head because of the alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, for CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free wet products or napkins and to stop leaving the hand detergent at the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand detergent containing an unreported toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth grade students from northern New York plotted to poison their "bad " teacher by putting antibacterial products in class, " according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned him in his classroom.
The police considered the plan to be "insignificant" and raised the disciplinary problem with the school inspectorate.
Rumour Mill: No misunderstandings at Celtic
Griffiths disassembles the rumors about Celtic's misunderstandings, Deila admitting that Hoops are not at the best moment but will return.
Hearts faces SFA regarding Neilson and Warburton's allegations is cautious about the January purchases that affected the team's unit
Dons increase the difference from Celtic to five points
The penalization of ADAM Rooney in the first round brought the Aberdeen to a close victory in front of the Hamiltons in Pittodrie, Dons getting a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths disassemble rumors about misunderstandings
There were rumors of misunderstandings at Celtic, disassembled by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team should not be subjected to increased pressure given that they are preparing to face the leaders of the Dutch religion.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are just waiting.
Absence of the Scots in the race for title bore the Dutch - by Boer
Former middleman of Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football supporters lost interest in Celtic - because they don't fight for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, now ambassador of the Ajax, said: "In Holland I no longer transmit the summary of the matches of the Celtics; why? "
Because they're not the Rangers there.
Here, it's not just about the return of the Rangers.
He's talking about Old Firm.
There's talk about both teams together and there's interest.
The tension is high in the Old Firm matches and not just the Scots want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, promise Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic was fighting out of power, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by the defeat in front of Aberdeen who played in 10 men, now in the top of the ranking with a advance of five points.
But Deila said: "Celtic had periods before and they will return. "
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We need the support of the Celtics because so too the players become better.
It's extremely important to stay united now.
Warburton's Prudence on January Transfers
Despite comments only a few weeks ago suggesting that he would have identified some targets for the January transfers, the Rangers chief, Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the Ibrox unit.
The former chief of Brentford said: "The January transfer period is very different from that of the summer. "
In the case of players transferred summer, there is a period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could observe in this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring players that aren't needed.
Celtic targets Michu after withdrawal
The Swansea striker, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he might withdraw upon the expiration of the Swans contract.
The 29-year-old player fought two years with his ankle problems and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts faces SFA regarding Neilson's comments
Hearts led with 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost with 3-2, but the red card of the case was then canceled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintained his statements, insisting: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance. "
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
Invincible Hibee was taken for granted after he admitted that he sang a song with offensive lyrics about the former player from Hearts, Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the enthusiasm of the moment," the striker said, adding: "There's no need to say that I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council Trusts in Dundee United Management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United Council still trust that the management team will change the situation - but he agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for "dirty victory " against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen's team must engage with despair by Hamilton Accies in order to get the seventh successive win in the league, which brought them five points in front of Celtic due to the penalty kick from Adam Rooney's first recovery.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or league, and that has not won games like this."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK increases
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, being 164,000 in the May period, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom total increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than in the UK, 5.5%, according to figures presented by the National Statistical Office (Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three-month period, the number of employees currently being 2.612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in that quarter to 74.0% - a figure over the average of 73.5 in the UK.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The long - term plan of authorities has laid the foundations for a stronger economy. "
It's been almost a year since Scotland's historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, the employment rate rising and the unemployment rate falling.
Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
During today, except for a late legal intervention, I will look at how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll stay in a room for observers in the Oklahoma Prison Execution Room and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, the idea terrifies me.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It's true, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, because applications usually exceed the number of places available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to 5.
The chosen ones will look at the execution impartially.
I can't do that.
I'd stay next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, plus I developed my own connection with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two hours half.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to notice what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wishes, get access.
I complained to her.
He acknowledged that "they could have formulated better, " but he still believes they are wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't even do it if I asked.
I told him he could get me out of the witness list anytime.
But he wants to have an international report on the subject.
He thinks that if he dies, publicity will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to find out more about the case, listen to the series of media files I've made.
I won't come back here on all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think he's most likely not guilty of murder.
I certainly don't think there was enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll look at him dying from this perspective.
I can't pretend I'm totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to look at a man who likes to die uselessly.
Peter Moody claims that the stewards tried to spy on him and threatened to withdraw from the race
Peter Moody said that StÃ©warzi Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on the stewarzi and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they are running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the elimination of Lady Tatai from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what's best for the field of races and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about the statements about spies and did not want to resemble "the fox that does not reach grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about that, and I've been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to such a high level of frustration that everything just suddenly suffocates," Moody said.
It's known he continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep quietly.
I want to go head upstairs and I want the owners I collaborate with to see that I'm trying to offer them everything that's best.
From the moment they start to think it doesn't happen that way, I have to give up the coach job.
At that point, I'm gonna have to think about what I'm gonna do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody threw the bomb into an interview given for racing.com where he said the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
"Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man whose name I'll tell him if I'm asking - and they offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the activity there," Moody told Racing.com.
Of course you think I'm a cheater.
If so, then you should all resign because you were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew at that time and know today.
Should I think it's something personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to begin to have a spinal column and can fire people outside the coaches to account for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
So stupid is my influence on the industry?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I need to take my license and give myself away and I have no doubt that the statements I'm making right now might cause them to think about this variant.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore, and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on and make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
Frustration of the trainer increased with the lengthy cobalt test investigation involving Lidari and the elimination led him to state that he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has labeled the treatment of race day as "ridicular" after applying a cataplasm with mud or clay to the horses, which violates the rules.
He's breaking race rules.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees accidentally put them down.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, what happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the day-to-day treatment of cataplasm, for which stewarzi opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that there is a need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by escape from the scene of the accident.
The biker was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police representatives state that the driver of the motor vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to the Shepparton police.
It seems he will be charged with running from the scene of the accident, the non-occurrence of the first aid and other road crimes.
The bicyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains interned in a stable state.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, responds to his opponents on wrestling charges.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticisms of the plating tactics used by his team as "denatured subjects" brought into discussion by the top two NRL favorites.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said that the referees allowed Storm players to "take their team to the curb" in Storm's nervous win in the qualifying final played Friday night in Sydney.
The coach at Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory in the North Queensland Cowboys qualifying match, played on Saturday night, when he called that match a "demonstration" of the rugby league and declared that the two teams in Queensland were not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in defense of the plating tactics approached by his team and said that the players simply focused on "contact" when they were plating.
Bellamy says she got trusted after two important coaches criticized her team, which means they were worried Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us with score 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, so much so that in the last six weeks we have really focused on contact in the placards and so we have changed the situation.
Trent is in this position for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so it's probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
We're funny how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "the soul of football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett's won the championship in 2010 playing "plicitor" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He argued his opinion by comparing his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he didn't even care about black under his fingernails.
But now he's got a team that can play what we consider to be exciting football, especially because of the fast young midwives.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his playing style - not every team has two middlemen like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably weren't thinking about us when they were thinking about important games.
Bellamy also highlighted that the match between Storm and Roosters was a sharper score-related match compared to the match between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, haven't I seen it yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two attempts, that means exciting game?
Or thrilling means taking breaks and not marking?
It's plans for me.
If I talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play home either with North Queensland Cowboys or with Cronulla Sharks in the finals next Saturday at AAMI Park, putting tickets on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep and then logged into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with children as their subject.
The girl subsequently woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was sleeping.
He looked on the phone and found the disturbing messages after which he immediately alerted his mother.
After arrival, the police saw the five photos then analyzed computers found at that address and found "careful" searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of children.
Hogg claimed that he did it to "attract pedophiles" on the Internet before he "pretends he's a cop to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to the court in Dundee: "He said it's an addiction - it's addictive to scare people.
He admitted that he did his computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to become a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the unknown person who sent him his pictures and about the fact that he asked that person to send him other pictures.
He said he did it to lure.
He said he doesn't think clearly when he drinks and he wants to see pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When the little girl found her messages on the phone, she called her mother and trembling and crying.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, 23 years old, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges that he made or took indecent pictures of children, and violated the conditions of parole on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court on 24 March this year.
Counsel for the defense, Gregor Sim, asked Hogg not to be registered in the register of sexual offenders because it can be said that this offence "did not involve a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before appearances for other files.
It was passed on to the sex offender registry before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
However, the filming of the fall did not become viral on social networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who claimed that they had received anonymous death threats, threatening them not to flee Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they ran away during his speech in Parliament - the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Parliamentary Group Leader Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but it is called "death", he told the journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer of value.
The leader of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" with regard to threats transmitted to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availabilities
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 availabilities as part of the company's efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the service sector.
This year. HP will split on the stock exchange into two companies, separating the division of computers and printers from operations with corporate hardware and booming services.
The planned availability will cost approximately $2.7 billion starting with the fourth quarter, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable cost structure," said Meg Whitman, President and CEO HP, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and will hold a large business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of companies to the new business style," Whitman said.
Working as a separate company, we are positioned better than ever to meet the growing requirements of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and "focus on providing integrated solutions without rivals" to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, whose activity was the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the Silicon Valley.
HP went through a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken HP, the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the US, is the most recent in the field, relying on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in one direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: The comedy series that taught us important lessons about the friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, the suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign against Unhappy Life (Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM)) designated 2015 as the Year of Men, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the centre of the struggle for the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted on more than 2000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is sufficiently surrounded by many friends "with a healthy mood", his chances of recovery are doubled.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy mental friends reduces the likelihood of mental disorders to half.
Of course, in order for friendship to work, it must first be accessible.
In this age of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the response often has priority before meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a powerful personality, open to fun and success, even though in reality isolation is the one that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - that further affects our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn't really buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused attention on this idea.
The characters were not defined by work but by their own personality, which they showed through interaction as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when he looks at football in the comfortable photos and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can associate with this situation, even though they often stop to fully explore their feelings.
As a social worker explained to me: "My role in listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, people who call on us don't feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying to manage yourself is strong, just as the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak open about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes into my mind when I try to offer more psychological adaptation mechanisms in the long term.
The series highlighted the little moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps objective, external intervention through the telephone, people arriving in moments of despair, long-term support comes from the family and close friends.
So, if you are participating in this weekend's FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the full replay of the filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hi.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcasted by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on occasion #FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG to give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after marking against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped PSG impose in front of the Swedish team Malmo.
Next we present the game's chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have done their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the series of matches in the Champions League groups, with a quiet victory 2-0 against Malmo in the match played on Tuesday on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of her debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the French champions to the advantage although they missed a number of occasions before securing the advantage with the goal marked by Cavani in the 61st minute.
Reaching Group A alongside Real Madrid and Åahtior DonetÄk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify in the best but also to improve the course towards the finals in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity of the void after which he was replaced by the team in his hometown and the club at which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or on the move in the Champions League, so victory with 2-0 creates problems for our opponents and establishes a comfortable difference from the next class, even though there are other aspects that we need to perfect throughout the season," says Blanc.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I'm sorry we couldn't give another one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident at one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 remission obtained at Bordeaux's home in Ligue 1 this weekend, but Di Maria took the light of the reflectors in the fourth minute.
Last month when it was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentinean offensive middleman was called the man who will lead PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he stumbled at Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defense before he swayed incredibly over Johan Wiland in the long corner of the right-hand side.
But if anyone expects PSG to win by punching their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off to get to this stage and entered the field with nine headlines at national teams, with a defense of five men and two defensive middlemen, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except for Nikola Djurdjic who passed Kevin Trapp's post in minute 34.
Instead, PSG players slowed down the pace a few times, giving a few unnecessary steps and non-finalizing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts only in the first round and was then replaced by Cavani even after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved to be much better at supporting his colleagues, his passing being the one that Di Maria sent in a Wiland-deviated shaft over the gate in minute 52.
The second goal was scored in a final after an hour of the match, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal in the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's focus.
This void eliminated Malmo's hope that they will rebalance the score and only a superb stop of Wiland from the distance to reject David Luiz kept the final score before the new entry Ezekiel Lavezzi was cancelled a gap in extensions.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later said that PSG were over one class and that "The last match I played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, I have only played in the league in Sweden, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
Down the hat for PSG.
They did an excellent game.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock prices on the stock exchange, raised $2.5 billion in the sale of shares as part of a massive debt reduction plan.
Glencore Company, quoted on the London stock exchange, said it sold new shares worth Â£1.6 billion to pay its debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is taking a stand at falling prices on the stock exchange, because the decline in China's economic activity influences demand and causes market disaster.
The preferential subscription fee increased the price of Glencore shares on the London stock exchange in Wednesday morning transactions.
The shares increased by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings at the FTSE 100 index, which opened to a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore disclosed the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of broader plans to cover almost a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 shillings per share, with 2.4% less than the Tuesday closing price.
It took 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern about the growth of the Chinese economy in prolonged stagnation led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other goods fell by 20-40%.
Xi insists on expanding the global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping said to a reform group that the economy must open up to the outside world in order to feed growth.
"China must commit itself to attracting foreign investment and expertise and to improving opening policies," Xi said, in the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group for the Continuation of General Reforms (Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform).
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new imbuedness and vitality and lead to economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulations, relaxation of customs control policies, encouragement of state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganization of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity where investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested gradually and improved by testing programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will provide the market with a more important role in resource allocation, ensuring a law-based business environment and providing a wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken the controls on the powers delegated to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to conduct their business.
In accordance with the declaration, China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open State-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
"State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and protect the legitimate interests of companies set up by foreign investment and will provide them with better services", according to the statement.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards", optimizing the requirements and fluidizing the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the right of lawyers to practice and educating judges and prosecutors.
The meeting also included Premier Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, not satisfied with the proposal of the Government to raise wages by 10%
The negotiations between Premier Victor Ponta and the leaders of the unions in Education did not reach any result, the Government proposing a salary increase of 10%, from 1 December, with payment on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted an increase of 15%, from November, or one of 20%, from December.
The talks took place at the Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, the premier being accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
Today's government proposal didn't thank us, otherwise we wouldn't have gotten in the position to summon the leadership of our federations.
The 10 percent we've been promised today is less than what we expected.
"In fact, these 10 percent are the money that we have made in our agreement with the government last year, for 2016," said Anton Hadar, President Alma Mater, at the end of the discussion.
Ponta: In the future health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have
According to him, there will be a meeting of the FSLI in which the representatives of the Government will participate to present to the representatives of the confederations of the country the proposal for wage increases, following that the trade unionists decide if they accept the offer of the Executive.
The Prime Minister has also told trade unionists that the government is trying to send the Salary Act as soon as possible to Parliament, so that it can enter into force on 1 December.
The normative act provides for the increase of wages in the educational system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, the increase foreseen in the document to be made outstanding, in the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised trade unionists to pay the total number of court sentences in 2016.
Immigrant crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 immigrants drowned on Tuesday in Turkish territorial waters after the ship they were in was wrecked.
Among the victims were 11 women and 5 children, reports AFP, according to Yahoo News.
The boat is located in the Aegean Sea and is heading for the Greek island Kos.
Turkey's coast guard has transmitted that it has managed to save 249 people who were in the shipwrecked boat, but they still do not know their nationality.
Previously, on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also in the weekend, 34 immigrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, located 15 kilometres from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat carried more people than its capacity, so it shipwrecked.
The route has recently become a popular one for immigrants who want to escape war and heavy life in countries such as Syria and Iraq.
Over 100 stewardesses fired because they were too fat
Air India's airline fire approximately 130 stewarzi and stewardese because they are overweight, announced the company at the end of last week.
The state company has announced that the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say that the measure is "ridiculous" and "smoky", writes The Washington Post.
Mass granting is the most recent of a ten-year fight between the company and the most crowded stewardess.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India began to use graphs with the ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired the new stewardese considered "exceptionally overweight", intruding this fact "may have an effect on reflexes and may prevent the necessary agility to carry out emergency measures".
Stewardess sued, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to make them weak have failed," explains a company spokesman.

I am extremely happy that I have reached this stage, to give the start of the Football Academy that bears my name.
To me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without worrying material about training.
They must have only one care: to play football as best as possible.
Technical details must not be their concern.
They have to value their talent.
This is what he wants to do at Paul Papp Football Academy.

I understand Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to rule, the whole party.
If you want us to formalize through a Congressional decision, we will also do this.
There won't be any emotion about it.
"There were no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that would give someone the insecure government or give someone the impression that someone in the party did not want PSD to remain in the government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the session of the PSD's Permanent National Bureau.
PSD announced when it will make congress - what will be decided then

Questioned if the hesitation about the candidate's announcements had anything to do with the file or, Dragnea said she didn't have that problem.
I don't have the problem you're referring to, but it seems fair and honest to me to all my colleagues in the party to announce or not a candidacy when the Congress date is formally established.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of social-democratic affiliates proposed Extraordinary Congress PSD on 11 October, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on months by the Party's Executive Committee.

An Italian was caught at the Customs Bors with immigrants hidden in the TIR
Two Sri Lankan citizens were spotted on Monday at the Bors customs, while trying to cross the border illegally, hidden in the semi-trailer of an Italian citizen-led ferry.
Following the investigations, it was established that the two would pay the driver with 4,000 euros to be transported to France, inform the Border Police.
On specific control, the border police observed a large travel bag in the truck cabin, where there were personal things for several people, which is why they carried out a thorough check on the means of transport.
On this occasion, border police discovered, hidden in the semi-trailer of the car, among the plastic slabs, two men.
As a result of the checks, two men, aged 28, are Sri Lankan citizens and asylum seekers in Romania.
"In the field of research, young people said they intended to reach France, the fact that they were linked to a co-national, through which they met with the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to the destination, where they would receive 2,000 euros per person", is shown in the communication of the Border Police.
The two migrants have been called "criminal work in the face of the crime of attempted fraudulent crossing of the state border".

What's going on with Coach Darren Cahill
Simona Halep stands before a crucial decision for her career, having to choose whether or not she will continue to collaborate with Coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year as part of the Adidas Player Development program, the Australian technician being alongside the novel only on important tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise to Cahill, who seems the only coach who managed to get in front of the capricious sport.
The Adidas programme will close at the end of this year, and Halep must decide whether to provide Cahill with a consistent contract or to give up cooperation.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We'll talk and see.
"After Singapore I will be able to give an answer," Simona testified at a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in current tennis, he is demanding a contract of about $1 million a year.
In addition, Australian is also a sports commentator, a job he wouldn't want to give up at the time of the girl.
The last match Simona and Cahill will work together is the Tournament of Champions in Singapore.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected.
Victor Piturca devalued how he broke up with Romania's national team last fall.
The former selector testified that he did not agree with President FRF, Razvan Burleanu, after he took over Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the country.
Finally, he proposed to the head of the Federation to raise his salary substantially to stay, but he was refused.
I'm not sorry I left the country right now.
Then I was sorry, leaving a job behind.
So I considered then that it's good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happens to me when I was a selector, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, I didn't respect my work.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found out different opinions from the press about me.
It didn't change me because it was very hard at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
We continued the work, everything went very well and probably changed its ideas as well.
But I wanted to go.
If he really wanted me to stay, then I proposed a contract increase.
We have around 400 and something thousand euros a year, we have about 600 thousand euros.
We didn't talk to Burleanu, but with his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we end up in the first place in the group," said Victor Piturca at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from Romania last fall, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminaries.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.

Rare disease suffered by a man
American Nick Hess was blessed by his family that he was an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was at risk, he could barely hold his feet and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he didn't drink alcohol, it was visible that he was in a state of drunkenness.
When she first accused me of being drunk, without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe as drinking alone, he's an alcoholic in secret'," he says, according to Mirror.
When he saw his wife's footage with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, he just didn't recognize himself: "I looked into my eyes and I wasn't there."
'It was awful, I didn't remember anything.'
Besides, his wife, who, although doubted for a while, finally went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath smelled like alcohol.
The moment that put Nick on top of it was when, after a minor accident, when he had been hit by another car, it was discovered that he had an alcoholemia three times over the legal tongue, although one night before he had only consumed one beer.
After years and unnumbered investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndromes".
Basically, the body makes all carbohydrates consumed ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who claimed that this could be Nick's disease was really his wife.
The disease hasn't had a cure since she gave up carbs, but Nick's had no such episodes.
Destroyed a Mercedes with a golf pass
A man from South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest against the services he had on the dealer's side.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf pass, causing enough damage to get the car out of use, transmits BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video came on the Internet, to the fun of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has defects that endanger his life and his family.
His anger came when the dealer he bought the car from didn't solve his problem, as he agreed.
The Government approved, on Wednesday, "National Strategy on Immigration for the period 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage in Romania's efforts to modernise the process of managing immigration in the national territory", according to a press release.
The source mentioned shows that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures have been taken to manage unitary, coherent situations caused by the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants into the territory of Romania, caused by situations of political, social, economic or military crisis.
"Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time they will pay particular attention to citizens from potentially migratory or national states," adds the recalled source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the border areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets out a number of general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, stricter controls on the legality of the seat of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the proper application of the removal and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the overall strategic objectives.
These included: facilitating access to the territory of Romania of third-country nationals who meet the employment needs of the labour force, facilitating access of third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for areas and professions identified as deficits.
Regarding the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that it represents "a means by which concrete activities are established to lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon".
Romania, in a European labour market top
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the high increase in the total cost of the labour force from the EU Member States in the second quarter of the year, compared to the similar period in 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The indices refer to expenditure on employers' staff.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total cost of the labour force rose by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, in place of three in the EU, to increase the cost of labour force
The largest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU states where the hourly cost of the labour force fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The advance of labour force costs in Romania from April to June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly cost of labour force in industry and services by 7.9% and, respectively, 7.6%.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly cost of the labour force.
The activity report of the TVR management, rejected in the committees: Stelian Tanase risks resignation
Parliament's Culture Committees rejected the work report of the Board of Directors of the Roman Television Society on Wednesday 2014.
To reject the report, 17 parliamentarians voted, one against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be submitted to the permanent bureaux meeting.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next plenary meeting will be discussed.
"I believe that in view of this situation it will be done relatively quickly," said the President of the Senate Culture Commission, Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was a good feeling" that the TVR management should be present at this meeting, under the conditions that no representative of the TVR management was present at the Culture Committee meeting.
It was a good feeling that TVR management was present because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation was made to CA members last night, about an hour ago that we didn't know any of the time, but today, after the Bureau meeting, I personally sent a fax to the TVR board inviting her.
I think that the moment you're called, you're a budget employee, paid out of public fees, and you're called to a committee meeting even if you don't like it alive.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution under Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of Parliament's cultural committees.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Committees on Budgets.
The debts we saw as they continued, came up with the idea that this year would have been up to date, but they didn't pay for the historical ones.
"I remind you that it is not my fault or anyone else in these committees has lost that attitude with the banks and the fissure, they are clear management problems," said Severin.
He added that after the activity report is rejected by the full meeting, elections will be held for a new Board of Directors, and he will elect the Director General of the Institute.
I don't know who will be proposed for this function.
Wonders won't be done.
It is important to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that there will be a genius who will stand at the tail here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, full of Parliament, by their vote, will choose with a lot of reason the people who will lead TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities to have - good feeling in the attitude towards employees because it's an evil of little ones coming from employees, complaints, dismissals.
"When you receive such sessions 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we talk about the financial situation that is a disaster," the President of the Senate Committee on Culture concluded.
Although he did not present himself in Parliament, the president-general of TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, requesting Parliament to consider a number of measures that could lead to the rescue and guarantee of the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexation of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase asks, in addition to indexing the TV tax, to amend and supplement HG 978/2003 on the tax for the public television service, for the purpose of updating the provisions at the level of technological changes per day, as well as for the regulation of the procedure for control in the field of TV pay and the finding of infringements and the application of penalties and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision to prevent the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv's mandate to collect the TV tax, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In its view, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission in cashiers.
Stelian Tanase asks to reduce the VAT rate for the activities specific to the public television station and the contribution for CNC from 15% to the level of 3%, but also the amendment of the law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility to receive budgetary/financial allocations for the purchase of licenses for major cultural and sporting events - World Football Championship, Golden Circle, Eurovision.
He contends that SRTv will be unable to pay in the following months since labour law obliges the employer to enforce judicial decisions, even if they are not definitive, and pay rights are given priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce expenditure on staff and TV production.
"As a result, travel and other cost-generating activities have been reduced, a number of commercial contracts have been renegotiated, and at the end of July TVR News has been closed," says President TVR.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by its own efforts.
"Without the support of state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Roman television will be, sooner or later, unable to fulfil its public mission", is mentioned in the letter.
The Chamber of Deputies' leadership decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
The children of Vasile Blaga, sent to court
The children of Vasile Blaga, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, were brought to justice on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Park near the Court of Appeal Bucharest.
It is accused of tax evasion, in a file with damage of about 600,000 euros, under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on 22 May.
It established the company of Axis Corporate Security SRL, along with his mother, in April 2009, one year after marrying Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigation revealed that, for the purpose of withdrawing taxes and taxes from the state budget, the representative of a company specializing in security services would have created an infringement circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, by which fictitious transactions would have been evident.
"In fact, the company's accounts would have recorded fictitious purchases of services, which, in reality, were not provided, with the state budget being damaged by about 600,000 euros," the Roman Police explained in a press release.
The Seici set the fate of Sanmartean
The Al-Ittihad club seats have established the fate of the middle Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that the partition of Sanmartean de Ittihad is imminent, the manager of the coach Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will not happen again.
Boloni is very pleased by Sanmartean.
Lucian plays the game title game and does it well.
The Seici also realized that he is the best and that he would be wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been another option to bring in another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There were more discussions, like the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing happened," Zaporojanu said for Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Elijah Sarbu was voted vice president at the Court of Auditors
Parliament voted on Wednesday to appoint Senator PSD Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes "for" and 108 "impotria" were recorded.
The vote was secret, with ballots.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi reports24.
Moreover, the liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment in this function and announced that they would challenge her to the JRC, under the conditions that he has a DNA file, but he does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Elijah Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics anymore.
Senator PSD will serve as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, remaining free after John Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court of September 2014, which found that he was called unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is about to play the role of a chef in the movie "Burnt", the actor made a devaluation that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up more in the kitchen: "I worked most of my life as a cook."
He revealed that he worked in the kitchen 15 years ago when he worked for a Greek restaurant, so that then, in college, he would continue on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so the entire childhood cooked with Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Wondering what future plans he had at that time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man to make plans for five years, "not even two."
"It's not motivating for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things that you would laugh if I told you," he said, stating that what he wanted from childhood was fulfilled.
By the age of 40, the actor acknowledged that he saw himself in the near future directing, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who took over all of this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational statements
Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned harshly, Wednesday morning, the statements of the Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta according to whom political decision-makers in Hungary are "no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
" Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational statements, insults the entire Hungary," the Hungarian Foreign Minister transmitted in a statement.
Civilised European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he lost his full support in Romania's internal policy," he added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a Tuesday evening post on Facebook, Premier Victor Ponta said he wants to draw attention and sanction the behaviour of high-ranking Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a shame for the European Union's culture and values".
I do not wish to respond to the challenges of Hungarian government representatives.
"This is a shame for the European Union's culture and values; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and as regards the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!", Ponta said on Facebook.
The Roman Prime Minister added that he is the adherent of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, appreciating that brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Sage, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decision makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in Hungary in recent days is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!", the head of the Roman executive stressed.
Previous Tuesday, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, qualified as "simple lies" the remarks of the Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta regarding the management by Hungary of the refugee crisis, appreciating that those statements are inappropriate for a leader of the 21st century, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned Tuesday as the "extremist and lying remarks" of the Roman Prime Minister in connection with Romania's internal political crisis and stated that Budapest is waiting for an apology from the Roman side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have always said and say is that they are against xenophobic discourses the idea of closing the borders, that all those who come are terrorists, are fools of the Middle Ages, and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get it, the problem is our logistic ability to treat those people like some people, not how they treat our Hungarian neighbors, with bat and with the insert.
"That's what I disagree with," said the head of the Roman executive at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Government of Budapest decided to start preparing in the field for the extension to the border with Romania of the fence that it is building at the border with Serbia, to face a possible change of route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision to raise a fence at the border did not solve anything of the refugee problem and "take Hungary out of Europe".
What's the connection between Osama bin Laden and Mecca's macara crash?
The Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, is "partial responsible" for the collapse of a macara on Friday, on the Great Mosque of Mecca, accident following the death of 107 people.
According to a commission of investigation, the company "did not comply with the safety rules", reported the Saudi press agency (SPA), reports BBC.
The company's directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of the former leader of the terrorist network Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently led by the brother of former terrorist leader Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years to expand the Great Mosque to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night during a storm, when a macara, probably unbalanced by the strong winds, crashed on the eastern side of Mecca's Great Mosque roof.
Following the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi shut up the challengers' mouths
Considered by many of the world's greatest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after the withdrawal from activity, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to achieve performance and in the new posture.
After unfortunate experiences with the national team, Stara or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team he sponsors.
After a year after taking over the team, the King demonstrated that he was able to transform a team that was struggling to save from downgrading into a top.
Thus, after a year, the Future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 victories, 11 remises and 11 breakers.
The billboard is one of a top team, which fights at European cups.
Things took a turn and better for the Future this season, intrigued the team came in second in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double than Stara.
On the other hand, even though he brought to the team more experienced players, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the start team names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodoropea appeared.
The club's policy made the Future a follow-up team for foreign teams, so Hagi sold this summer 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Next to the Star, the Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
The large countries come with solutions for the entire EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the co-chair of the Roman Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the purely polite means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with."
But there are masses that have started and we can't turn back history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as best as possible and adapt them to us.
In Cristian Ghinea's opinion, we are at an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, the Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted for the situation now".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JHA council that actually didn't solve anything?
It is clear that the EC President in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the Council.
All the predictions were that he would have had the necessary votes.
Before the Lisbon Treaty, the principle of unanimity is applied in JHA and any State could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, is applied, and the Council approves it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said that the votes were there.
But they didn't want to go before.
Because it's a sensitive matter, rejection reactions even appeared in Germany against the opening policy of Chancellor Merkel and did not want many countries to appear as an "EU" reaction sending migrants on their heads.
They did so, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen government and we will probably be witnessing major changes there in the coming period.
So the mandatory odds weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just allowed to breed again?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also Germany's border with Turkey, in fact, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps it will give up the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are responsible for the first time, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece rules, you can't say forever that it's Greece's business.
Problem and commune.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve it without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism to impart the effort of reception?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if they get to them.
Because there is still a problem: what are you doing with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states are going to take over the migrants: you're going to country X or country Y.
It will probably reach some unique filtration centres, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
He's working on solutions like this.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
They are strong who have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are strong without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenofob current.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to go to Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have started to leave, winter is hard to get past the Mediterranean, but we expect next year at a wave maybe even higher.
What do we do with these people?
My prognosis is that we'll get used to this problem, we won't look at it so catastrophic from a media point of view.
You're talking about the toughest with the little or the biggest experience.
Does it seem to you that there is any place where the integration of large groups from an extra-European culture has really succeeded?
I look at the Magrebians in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course their integration is more difficult than other migration waves, but that doesn't mean they don't integrate at all.
There was an unintegrated part that created major social problems in France, Germany, Britain.
But purely police means won't work.
Let's create the fortress Europe is illusory.
It must be addressed to the integration mechanisms in European societies.
Here were some mistakes.
We have to be more pretentious.
To ask these people to learn their language, to try to take the values, not to remain with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family even through convenient marriage.
However, the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration it does not mean that we have to look at them as they drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't think, it doesn't mean that it's going to make the country over the night and you can take it back.
Until the solutions come up, we see fortresses within Europe.
The borders were closed, the walls were raised, checks were reintroduced at the border in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such, not the Schengen space as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimal and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high in the countries where they put their foot for the first time these migrants.
I mean, we're running around free, but each one of us is with his problems.
In front of such a wave you can't do it, because some countries don't do it.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run it doesn't change much.
After the attacks in France, we do not have much more drastic anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that sets in both directions.
And it's so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virile.
And then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and the public opinion gets excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the real single European market.
And I don't think that Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
There'll be other rules.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another age and not adapted to the situation now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
As a small country, who thinks that, if he pulls the bucket on his eyes and chokes his ears, the subject disappears.
In front of the reality of migrant waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your little country problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
You're not, you're not playing big country level.
Great countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romans for Schengen will drop very much.
President Iohannis says it might be good that we haven't already entered.
So we move from desperation of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is, of course, a risk that Romania and Bulgaria will enter Schengen as migrants to see us as an alternative route.
Which does not mean that it is a reason not to enter Schengen anymore, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, will be unique rules of acceptance of migrants, unique rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria in Ukraine no one else died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She thinks it's great power to confuse Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without Putin's military and financial effort, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to crash before the principal or opponent was the Islamic State.
Some two years was a struggle between the Assad regime and the moderate secular and Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia was able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates outbreaks of instability and chaos that can't close.
But you're great power only if you have solutions.
Playing off-side is just a strategy to win time.
Putin's probably waiting for offers to be made, he'll press the buttons to solve the situation.
The offers don't come because the world isn't convinced that he can sort out some way or other issues created by him.
But I don't agree with the theories that say these people are driven by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users used the "Like" button, and now the social network representative prepares the other opposite, the "Dislike".
Marti, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will be available soon, informs New York Times on blog.
Zuckerberg specified that the "Dislike" button will rather show a shade of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the times when someone posts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike".
The network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked to have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said that it is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable giving Like to that post," the Facebook representative pointed out.
The version of a new Facebook button was not received well by everyone.
"There is already enough hatred on Facebook and social networks," said Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of the New York Times, where the article with this topic was posted.
"I'll give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, argued that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, social media analyst at the eMarketer company, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that a single button can convey a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, the electoral campaign in America is approaching, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands coming into the mass at its southern border with Serbia, announced the government councillor Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary declared the state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the influx of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania, remembers DPA.
The measure attracted a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Even yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to ask for asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," said the Minister for Refugees, Aleksandar Vulin.
Prior to the imposition of the new immigration legislation, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced on Monday.
More than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa also settled in Serbia's Hungary in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially Germany.
"The new" seat of the county council stands to fall.
Two builders in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are falling apart because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the works.
The county council office in Vasile Alecsandri Street will manage to break down on its own.
Within a year and a half of the completion of the building consolidation and recasting work, the work has not reached half.
A final stage in the era of the building was consumed in the past days, when the National Dispute Resolution Council (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the technical project contract for the works that are still to be carried out.
The original project was developed by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the builder and the termination of the works, the negotiation procedures were initiated without the publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, the company to update the technical project and then to organise a new contract for works.
"The negotiations did not, however, end with a contract, CJ appreciating that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution," said RÄzvan Timofciuc, representing public relations in the CJ.
The CJ decision to discontinue direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
The Court of First Instance sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it, as late as possible.
However, this does not mean that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the CNSC decision at the Court of Appeal, only after a final judgment of the Court of Appeal could be taken into consideration the finding of another designer.
Thus, building consolidation work could be resumed as early as next year.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, the refurbishment of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We wait to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
The consolidation work of the former police headquarters began in 2011.
A first contract of works was terminated in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei had been carried out.
The licence was renewed, the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the firm entered into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after payments of 1.5 million lei had been made.
The work has so far been carried out in a proportion of about 50%.
Initially, work on consolidation, recasting and atticing of the building had been evaluated at 7.7 million lei.
"Gata, I'm saying everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastru
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file at the Cadastre Office signed an agreement to acknowledge the facts against a delay in prison.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other accused, in front of the former chief, Narciza Nedelcu
A consultant at the Cadastre et PublicitÃ© Immobiliaire (OCPI) is accused of DNA in a corruption file acknowledged his fap tele.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru DÄtÄlu was registered yesterday at the Iasi Court, the judges establishing a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel DÄsÄlu was accused of false intellectuals in continuous form and agreed to execute two years in delayed prisons as well as work for the benefit of the community.
As regards the facts attributed to DÄsÄlu, the prosecutors have stated that he, as adviser to the Cadastru Office, together with other colleagues, "made in false several minutes of acceptance, sell the contracts of services in service previously filled by the O.C.P.I. IaÈi with the directors of the companies SC Gauss SRL, SC Grupo Five SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Agency of Ca dastru and Topography SRL and PFA LipÈa Ètefan, which inadvertently attested that the contracted services were carried out in total, under the conditions that they were not carried out and were not submitted to O.C.P.I. IaÈi".
Last days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of the OPCs were brought to justice in this file, the charges being the settlement of services to the companies mentioned, although the works were not carried out.
Pre-judgment exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of President FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of women's national handball for qualification at Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handbal Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, in a press meeting, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
With regard to Romania's national women's handball team, "the main goal is to qualify at Rio Olympic Games, but for this it must go through two stages of caudian forks, first the World Championship and second the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for Olympic Games.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
The staff will be composed of seven or eight persons.
He wants second coach, doctor, two masseurs, porter coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to get qualified some things, more precisely material for physical training, that we never heard of.
That's all to get to the Olympics and I'll do whatever it takes to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot, a lot of money.
But that's the way to perform.
Because right now we're in the Stone Age with preparation.
"The teams we fight with have these materials and they've had them for some time," said Dedu, who mentioned that he's trying to get the amounts needed to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
President FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility that our country will host a major handball competition.
We don't have a hall in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure issue and it is shameful to be asked the sign of a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let's not forget that in other corners of the world, Olympic neighborhoods have been built entirely within two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic zone of Barcelona there was a dump of garbage, and now it has reached a mark of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympiad was a success and investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," said Dedu.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. GaÈu went civilized with a project, people gave their agreement in principle, but it became clear very quickly that the room will never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, I told them that we wanted, that we were able to organize and they said that I agree and invite them to the first game in the new hall in Bucharest and then we talk concretely.
"So we have all the opening, and at EHF and IHF, but we don't have the infrastructure," the FRH official explained.
The former great handballist avoided evaluating the chances of the female teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I asked all coaches to be reserved in predictions, that if they do not fulfill they will turn against them".
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian Rugbiists debut on 23 September, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said Tuesday, in a press conference, that all members of the lot of Romania are ready for the World Cup matches in England, where they hope to win two wins: "We are ready".
Both me and my colleagues are with the engines at maximum speed.
We trained to give the best performance in the four games.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But surely, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it's the setting of so many years of work.
I wish I wouldn't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with beautiful results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, are proudly the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romanian national team selector Lynn Howells, who has first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of rugby selection: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
To me it is very important that every game to make Romanians proud of the national team.
The president of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitras, trusts that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in rugby in recent years.
We have a very difficult group and want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish athletes success and I believe that we will be at the height of the event.
"These guys started playing in Romania's teams for 18-19 years, so there's cohesion, there's a gang of friends, who set out to make a dream," Dumitras said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve into Group D with the following scheduled matches: with France on 23 September in London; with Ireland on 27 September in London; with Canada on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition begins on Friday, on London's Twickenham Stadium, with the England-Fiji match in Group A.
New Japanese culture courses organized at the University "Al.I. Cuza"
About the arrangement of flowers in a vase, painting in the cough, but also a light study of the beautiful arts specific to the Land of the Rise Sun you can learn at courses organized by students.
The Japanese Culture Students' Circle of Iasi organizes new Japanese culture courses (ikebana, sumie and fine arts) from October 2015 to June 2016, both for beginners and for people with disabilities.
These will take place at the Centre for European Studies of the University of "Al. I. Cuza" in Iasi and are organized for the promotion of Japanese, traditional and modern arts and culture.
For these there is only one participation fee of 50 lei per month per person.
In addition to art lessons, participants will be able to participate in exhibitions and other cultural activities promoting beauty.
The Japanese culture courses we have proposed have been conceived as an invitation, addressed to the general public, to take the first steps on the road to self-knowledge through art.
"Interested people will be able to find out how to achieve harmonious floral sculptural creations (ikebana), how to surprise the soul of the surrounding elements in plastic compositions using Japanese art of painting in the cough (Sumie) or how to express its own individuality and creativity through the plurivalent universe of beautiful arts (graphic, drawing, painting)," said Sorin Mazulu, the teacher of these courses.
Courses are addressed to all those who are passionate about art, regardless of age or experience.
Registrations take place until 30 September, and those who wish to ask for more information can do so at the phone number: 0742.027,153 or at the e-mail address: studentscultura@gmail.com.
14 million lei give the Hospital "Sf. Spiridon" in IaÈi to the budget correction
What will be purchased with this large amount of money?
The Hospital "Sf. Spiridon" received approximately 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health following the budget correction.
The money that the medical unit received to use by the end of the year will be invested in the modernization and development of clinics, but also in the medical equipment and technique for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, a new radiology apparatus, six surgical kits, six appropriate ATI beds, an ophthalmogenic microscope and other necessary devices for performing the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and construction work of the "Grand Ars".
Of the money from the budget correction, UPU will receive 500,000 lei to complete the modernization work in the main section.
"In addition, the following days we will receive works from the gateway linking UPU to cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the proper transport of the patient from UPU to nearby clinics," the medical unit manager explained.
The hospital will soon have in court and Dermatology Clinic of the Tatars, which it will organize in the ambulance, in the same form as it is currently operating.
The clinic will operate in the area where allergy, haematology and endocrinology are located in the ambulance and will have about 30 beds.
The jack, made by laughing of RATP controllers and a folder.
A tourist's skin
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my experience, neither I nor my wife ever want to go to your town again.
Without wanting to, they hit the wrong information in the folds, the misunderstanding of the RAPT controllers, and, bonus, a fine "as the law says".
The husbands arrived in Iasi a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the center and asked for tourist packages.
They also received a flyer in which the RATP routes were passed.
"Armed" with these maps, the husbands visited the Iash.
But two days ago, you were in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Because it wasn't a ton of tickets in the station near Copou Park, they were based on the information printed on the flyer: that I can take a ticket by SMS.
No one has told them that this service no longer exists.
Trusted in the flyer, they got on a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions on the flyer.
Unfortunately for them, he made the appearance of a team of RATP controllers.
They said there was no longer a service for two years and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
Where do I know what was written in the local press, me coming one night before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation, they said they didn't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said all I can do is give us one fine instead of two (my and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day of visiting stand at the gendarmerie and giving statements there!" Ovidiu says.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of the erroneous information on the fold and the controllers who "applyed the law to blood".
It's not fair, and I did a session at RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not overreacted, but the point is I felt wrong.
Ghinion for Vaslui rapists.
They had an accident and stayed in pre-emptive arrest.
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui moved from yesterday to the Court of Appeal IaÈi.
The junior magistrates judged the first term of judgment in a non-public meeting in which the seven young men accused of babbling an 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Prior to the actual commencement of the trial session, one of the outgoing judges who had been assigned the file, Viorel Munteanu, filed an application for abtention, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
The judge served until the summer of this year at the Vasului Court, where he was the president of the Sectione Pe nale, he being the one who, on 9 April, admitted a challenge made by four of the accused, having their arrest at home.
Currently, the file is judged by a complete one of which are Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu masters.
Previously, in the file, he filed an abstention and Judge Dan An ton, on the grounds that his daughter was in a conjugation relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges decided that Vaslui's rapists would remain in pre-trial detention.
The blacks will remain in prison for at least another 30 days, when the judges will rediscuss the possibility of their release.
The next trial period will be held at the Court of Appeal IaÈi on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal Iasi, the van with which the rapists were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident in the neighborhood of PÄcurari, the car entering Iasi on the belt.
Iveco's self-utility with which the seven rapists were transported hit a Volks wagen car that got off Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van travels from the end of the Peace.
The car entered IaÈi here because the employees of the Prison Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to IaÈi on the Grazduri, then on the belt road.
They cut the road a few miles away.
Immediately after impact, the arrest escort called for another transport, to take over the detainees.
In a short time, a car was sent to the scene of the accident from the Prisoner of Maxima Seguranza IaÈi, who took the seven prisoners and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
Following the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
In order to transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the cars, and the arrests came out at speed, two to two.
"The accident has not been reported to the police, because the drivers of the two motor vehicles have amicably understood the damage to be paid," said Chief Commissioner MÄdÄlin TÄranu, IPJ.
Major migration
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what will follow.
What about Europe?
I say this from the outset, clearly and clearly: the 7,000 refugees that Romania should and should be naturalized represent, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge in comparison to the Romanian State's ability to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary share proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will actually agree to settle in our localities, the chances of integrating them quickly into Romanian society are extraordinary for small people.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Paralyzed by interlocutors and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate gypsies is just a banal example.
In addition, governments of any colour were unable to absorb European funds, to make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, to provide decent medical assistance, to gather dirt on the street, to create honorable paid jobs or to keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they flee?
But what brings much wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
First of all, we are struck by the bellicose fascination of the strong EU states, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing the troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearsome hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, still do not accept the other - from another language, from another religion, from another blood.
Probably afraid not to steal a national being.
Finally, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, while invoking only the horrors of war as a reason for departure, do not accept any other destination of exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
However, not all refugees are Syrians, and in Pakistan there is no war.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analysed can only be taken into account.
Causes must be eliminated, some support and, with strict emphasis on the book of political correctness, call for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why are they leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an ankylosed, disbanded and outmoded construction.
I deplored the fact that Romania is not capable of inventing a country project, but here is no future plan for the EU either.
And improvisations and threats don't help anything.
So, what further use is the EU, if the only advantage Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be discussed because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders like cheese?
At one point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the migrant crisis, though.
Over the next decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially from Africa to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what will follow.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destination, practically imposed
The grant licence shall cover a period of 10 years.
After seven years in which it was closed, the club in the Court of the Romanian Literary Museum is offered by the Council of the Court for a 10-year concession.
The construction has a useful surface of 134 mp, on two levels of food.
CJ accepts only those of literary coffee, bookshop or other activities with a cultural profile as destination data.
The building was valued at 68,300 euros, with an annual bid start value of 6,830 euros, with a bid step of 25 euros.
The concessionaire shall continuously and continuously operate the building and cover the entire costs of rehabilitating the property in accordance with the technical design to be developed.
"The Club Pogor building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period of operation of the public supply unit in these areas and not after its evacuation, no current repair and maintenance work has been carried out as is currently required during the operation of a building", is mentioned in the documentation relating to the tender procedure.
The club's concession offers are expected until 18 September.
Two brothers in Tomesti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital.
Two 9-year-olds, 11 of them from Tomesti, brothers, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was treated, and the drugs weren't hidden.
The children were rushed to the Holy Mary hospital in Iasi.
They're stable, as doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20 he received a brave gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in unclear conditions, in the black of the '90s, when she had only two months of life, little, boulder and helpless, and then adopted by a strong family in Italy, in the same years when the adoption was vaguely regulated, a young girl, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met again in IaÅi yesterday with biological parents from a village of county, after nearly two decades when no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will fulfill these 20 years, and her adoptive parents from Palermo have thought to offer their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Iasi, to know their unclear past.
"The Day of Iasi", who assisted in the search for the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, was witness to these meetings that practically broke your heart.
Reporting of reporters, emotions of moments, statements of those involved, their reactions are quite moving and overwhelming.
Crina's story begins 20 years ago in the Rugino city of the island, when it was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the hospital, in the city.
There began to be disagreements between parents at home, and the mother had to leave her home.
He decided to keep the girl, and he decided to send me home.
She stopped the girl, and since then I haven't known anything.
"When I found out he was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls Alina, the biological mother of the girl.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in the Pacific, and still the girl's father, Costica Balkan, went to work in Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives would have to break up forever.
They never found Crina in the hospital again.
After internment, Crina's father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when she returned, never found her again.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"I thought she was abandoned," she tells a family niece.
Because of the financial problems, Grandma couldn't come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the doctor's care.
Because no one has ever been interested in the fate of the child all this time, it was taken over by the Directorate General for Social Assistance and Child Protection Iasi, who then gave it to the Bucium Plasament Center.
It was years when abandonment and adoption were more regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but did not succeed.
They fell in love instead of the blond Crina, and after some time this would definitely move with them to Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, while the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
"Like my wife would have given her life," he tells us smiling Salvadore, the adoptive father, while holding the girl's mother-in-law's hand in his hand.
In the country, Crina's parents, Alina and Costica, continued separate searches, each on which they could.
The father asked the authorities of the Ruginosa, but he did not receive any answers where his child might be.
The police then transmitted it to him that it is possible to be killed, but at Iasi parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me at the courthouse she was gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And the conditions to look for it I never had.
We prayed to God to be fine.
I've been thinking about her in all the years that have passed, but there were no possibilities to walk, to find her.
"It's hard," he tells us with tears in the eyes of Crina's biological mother.
But even though the years have passed, the parents of Ruginosa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past linked her to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," Crina says.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim, the director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Counselling Antidrug Iasi, was contacted by a acquaintance from Italy, who explained Salvadore's desire to find the biological family of Crimea.
And the search only started from a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
We just got a name, Balkan Costica, then the local, Rugino.
Soon I had an activity with the city hall there, and I could ask if there was a local name received.
Then they gave me a few indications, only the person found wasn't the one they were looking for.
"It took about a month to finally find the biological father of the girl," explains Commissioner Romique Ichim.
In total, more than three months have taken the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially that each had their domicile in another locality.
We started work somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided that a first meeting would take place in September," Ichim added.
On the weekend that passed, Alina and Costica first saw the girl lost in the halls of the hospital in Iasi 20 years ago.
The father, moved, could barely control his tears, and his hands were shaking constantly.
He barely changed a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't sleep anymore.
He was still excited, shaking.
"To see your baby after so many years, there's something," a niece tells us, came along with Costica from the Ruginoa.
Crina's meeting with mother and biological brother
In his discussions with his daughter, who will study at a well-quoted university in Italy, Costica Balkan told him, among other things, that if he ever wants to return to him, to the village, to come quietly: he can give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy from the village and to bury a household.
Mom's excited, she's crying, and she hardly believes that something like that can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think that could happen.
I've seen such cases on TV, I've been thinking about these years, I've been hoping, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we'll visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," he tells us with tears on Alina's cheeks, Crina's mother, while holding a napkin in his hand.
In him he hides his tears, fortunately, because soon he will see her face after so much bitter weather.
On the other side, Crina, who will only be in a few days, this month, 20 years, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she sketched out a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to gather his thoughts, because he's got a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are finally the ones who raised me.
It'll be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses.
First family reunion in Iasi
In the United Square, under the dawn of the autumn, the family of Ruginoasa once again joins their destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old, finishes high school, according to the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
I don't break up borders or countries anymore, but just a barrier: the barrier of language.
More than, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Iash, easily passed.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind done, and that, in the future, if the opportunity arises again, they will do it again.
It's the first event of this kind organized, such an emotional charge, and I'm glad to be successful.
We, at the Centre, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with people who are consumers, people who are addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to get the companies back something good.
"If I'm ever asked for such an event again, I'll do it with great love," says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Drug Advice Iasi.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, goes away telling stories.
I understand: they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice with weapons at the foot yesterday at the PSD.
Everybody pulls their soul
The seats in the PSD's subsidiary closed a armistice with a gun on their feet.
After successive rounds of discussions, from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party's executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the social-democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates to the party's functions.
Far from ending, the internal party war seems to have only taken a break to allow fighters to pull their souls.
Dragon didn't give an ultimatum.
It has released a very simple and very current message under the conditions now: try to find a solution to not endanger the party.
On October 3rd we have elections in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of the weekend talks only led to the conclusion that nothing certain was established.
In the October elections, for the office of President of the county subsidiary of PSD, a fierce competition is expected.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main office of the party's subsidiary is the Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, Judge Vasile Catha and the interim President of the Judicial Council, Victorel Lupu.
These could also be added to the mayor of the municipality Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant taken into consideration is also the candidacy of PSD's leader of county councillors, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu no longer joins the race, sources within the party claiming that he is not interested in the function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations of the last few days is that of the former branch leader, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day candidates can be submitted, and they wouldn't be admiring anyone if it happened.
"It's important that we stay together, and we'll stay together after October 3rd, when we have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent Office and all new management structures," said CÃ nea.
Until the holding of the internal elections, the leadership of the county branch of PSD will be ensured by Victorel Lupu, a close to Nichita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on leave until 29 September, the preparation of the elections being practically ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, county councillor Mihail Popescu, in cold relations with Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions over the last few days as leading to "partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
It has reached a partial consensus, in the sense of supporting a unitary team to deal with the county.
"However, on the other hand, there are several variants of the intentions related to the candidacy to the PSD President Iasi, the list remaining open," said Stanciu.
A judge has denied the rapist's file in Vaslui on the grounds of concubination
The seven young people in Vaslui County convicted of rape arrive today at the Court of Appeal IaÈi.
Vasluians sentenced to punishment between five and eight months and eight years and four months will today present their arguments on their release, after the substantive court, Vaslui's Court, determined their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was pronounced.
The file was registered with the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, Judge Dan Anton making an application for abtention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked the fact that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's concubine, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luke defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the greatest punishment in this file.
How the Judges Motivated the Sentence
At the end of last week, the magistrate at Vas's Court who sentenced the seven young men motivated the sentence.
In motivation, the judge talks about the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of outrage among the public opinion.
"The Court finds that, after placing under the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not deprivation of liberty, under the influence of the attitude of the accused, the families and their local supporters, there has been a strong feeling of outrage at the level of the local and national community that persons accused of serious acts are judged under a less restrictive measure", the reasoning of the Vast Court is shown.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defence of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked the fact that the girl they violated would not be "the church door".
"The Court stresses that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, an aspect that the defendants wanted to highlight through the defences they have formulated, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext," it further states in the explanatory statement.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity they have enjoyed in the last decades can no longer continue the same in the following years.
By Saturday probably few people knew in Romania who Jeremy Corbyn is.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the British Labour Party, many wonder to what extent it can affect the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of post-war laborers.
Marxist declared, anti-monarist (he asked Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to take the royal family out of Buckingam Palace), an anti-American ferocious and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today"), and of the terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and get out of NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is close to preferring the United States.
According to the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like the kind he was telling and promising and Tsipras in Greece until the moment he broke into the real world and economic laws.
The economic programme of the new Labour leader includes, among other things, massive renationalisations and printing of money as a solution to the financing of projects for the development and coverage of very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the solution to money printing is not unanimously adopted on the world, we would then have a global prosperity!, but who else to prevent such details.
Of course, we can tax banks on blood, become some kind of left-wing enemy, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterrand and Hollande's mandates.
The additional amounts are quickly swallowed by generous promises, without cover, made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher rightly drew attention, "the problem of socialism is that at some point someone else's money ends".
A few give Jeremy Corbyn real chances of ever becoming prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical left-wing leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in his beliefs as the party's fresh leader, failed lamentably in elections.
And then there is still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more sensitive than they are now.
Under the conditions of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant throughout the labour force, and extended automations have made it necessary for the industry to require a massive high-skilled workforce, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even in opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its latest Financial Times number, Corbyn's choice increases the chances of Brexit, i.e. the exit of Britain from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with rhetorical anti-immigration and you look at the crisis of refugees who roam from the EU themes, you reach an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide following the referendum, which would take place until 2017, to leave the Union the symbolic loss of capital for the entire European project and the deep failures created within it by the Euro crisis and now that of refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
All the more so as for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterbalance to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin is becoming the dominant actor in any case).
It's true, the British business environment, the City, are strong advocates of staying in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer that of the past.
There are many resentments, which grow in intensity even these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we have even recently had a sample in Jean Clude Junker's speech, tends more and more to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States by consulting with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens under the conditions where electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time and Eurosceptics increases spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative load has reached higher rates than ever before.
Where and the conclusion that Financial Times draws when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that departs from national interest.
If voters make a decision, then Britain will stay in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in today's politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we will see a more pronounced integration of the Euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and the periphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feeds its populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in oocidental societies.
From economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed over the last decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both caused by prompt decisions that have taken into account only the integrated political ambitions, not the ability and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and can greatly affect the situation of Romania.
And it's hard to rule out anything from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are capable of dealing with such complicated situations.
Constantin Burncous, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Cheeses: "Take and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him all over the world.
Behind his fame lies something almost forgotten today, when millions of successful stories are delivered to us, recipes for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "trude."
What do you write about Constantin BrÃ¢ncous?
What else is there to say, actually?
His figure appeared on the banknotes.
And recently, a well-known Romanian bank hired an actor to play it in an advertising video.
Cheeses produce and deliver money nearly 60 years from when it's no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear its name.
Moreover, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with the odrasla, he hears the following instructions: "Let's go to the park, to the BrÃ¢ncuÈi".
The country is surrounded by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known from so many worlds, from children, to the elderly.
BrÃ¢ncous's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Neither the communists managed to remove it from Romania's memory and culture.
His cities today grow the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what else would you say, write about this man?
Look at the pile of books and articles that try to reconstruct his destiny, the life of BrÃ¢ncous seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you weren't lucky enough to be born in a big city and in a family as strong as you can, your chances of success in life are almost null.
The life of BrÃ¢ncous is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Perhaps the following text should begin from here.
With a sentence, however detestable they are.
Look at the stories of stupid success, which are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on television.
Look carefully at this man's figure.
Do you want to know how to manage in life, how, today, he heard a whole mapmond?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin BrÃ¢ncuÈi was born on 19 February 1876 in HobiÈa, a small village in PeÈtiÈani commune, Gorj County, on the slopes of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Mary and Radu Nicolae BrÃ¢ncousi.
Although it came from a family of wealthy peasants, BrÃ¢ncous leads a modest life, but one of them would pick up the landmarks that will guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering his childhood and the places he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre TautÄa, from Paris, in 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people led, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything went quiet from one season to another.
And you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
BrÃ¢ncous's childhood was, however, far from an idyllic one.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in the birthplace.
The moment is reproduced in the work "BrÃ¢ncuÈi. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantine BrÃ¢ncous was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the "cauldron" was made, chasing those who taste the liquid to see if the process is going properly, BrÃ¢ncuÈi caught a moment of general disregard.
He fills his palms with tunic and drinks on unsavory.
It falls into sleep almost instantly.
The first men only notice after a few minutes.
My mother panics, then in hysteria, believing that her son died.
At night, when the father, Radu, returns from the life accompanied by the milkmen, he sees from the distance the desperate signs of those waiting for him with their soul to the mouth.
The party immediately turns into jail.
Father is already thinking of burial.
However, someone thinks it's good to call Baba BrÃ¢ndasa, doftoroaie and servants of the Cheeses.
The brunette checks the baby's breath, then puts it under the horse's nose, gathered around.
The child sneezes strong.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep his drink, of joy, the milk party continues with even more strength.
The next day, the father and son meet through the pound.
Radu BrÃ¢ncuÈi has Constantine gather some knots and bring them to him.
The father takes his child upside down and, with the nuts brought by the boy, beats him to keep in mind.
And while he feels the heaviness of the blows, the little BrÃ¢ncous has the revelation that the world can be looked at from another perspective and that things around it can be turned upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would admit to old age, if not the astrus himself participates in his disorder.
To have also been the sun as troubled as his father from what had happened to him?.
At this time, the city doesn't work
A parliamentarian calls on politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent Member Viorel BlÄjuÈ called on PSD and PNL to stop the internal struggles and reorient their agenda to the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great breakup and so much.
I haven't seen anything from the 2012 U.S.L. projects to continue.
No highway, no Regional Emergency Hospital, see only how politicians dispute their possible location according to real estate interests.
Let's just leave a little politics aside, get together and talk.
At this time, the city doesn't work.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you," said BlÃ¡juÈ.
He felt that the current political class had disappointed the voters in the elections, and the result would be a very small presence in the upcoming local elections, around 30%, practically representing the faithful electorate of the parties.
The honourable Member also believes that the voters will be all about the traditional parties, expressing their reservation to new political initiatives, such as the "For Iasi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break out of the right-wing electorate, not the PSD.
Such parties rely on civic active people, who are usually right-wing.
"It breaks even more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," said BlÄjuÈ.
He stated that he was not interested in a candidate for the upcoming local elections, disclaiming the rumors about his intention to join the race for the City Hall.
I said I don't want to run for any local office.
I'm still thinking if you're going to continue as a deputy in the future.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Iasi and in the discussions in the halls with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make my picture.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything," said Blajut, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected.
A fellow from the Tatars said he couldn't get his money and he has to go on the bus.
Let's not be hypocritical.
There's no small money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to pick up the money from the cash register.
At the end of my term of office, I will report on everything I've spent, apart from the employees' salaries at the firm and its maintenance.
It happened to rise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transport, accommodation and other discounts.
"To tell a parliamentarian that he can't get his money is clean hypocrisy," concluded BlÄjuÈ.
