Inflation in Europe has eroded on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro area countries was higher than forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, the European Community Statistics Office in Luxembourg indicated.
The official forecasts indicated only 3 per cent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the key interest rate by saying that the decline in interest, with commodity price growth and the fall in unemployment, would lead to the generation of inflationary spirals.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two per cent.
According to one analyst, it is the Catch 22 for the ECB: "inflation must be deterred" in order to stop having to intervene on this subject at a later date.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent has been a record over the past 12 years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area took off because of the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Grain futures market ratings increased by 88 per cent and soybean prices have also reached their highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price increased by 52 per cent and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 per cent, however, over the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the steering rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) has increased significantly in early December, so since 2002, it now has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Institute of Survey) has never previously seen such low socialist support, i.e. 13 percent.
For the faithful voters, the difference would represent, because of the greater determination of the opposition voters, more than two thirds (71 percent) support against the support of a fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is two percent in the entire population.
Of the faithful voters certain to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly serious has never been so high, rising to 41 per cent and according to 46 per cent complementary the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic prospects of spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population anticipates an increase and only one tenth predicts an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 per cent of those surveyed, a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, felt that the Prime Minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27 percent trust the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the Prime Minister can be addressed without change of government.
While after last October's riots, 35 per cent of the respondents wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, this rate currently represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) felt that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of the intention to vote, 60 per cent of the respondents replied that they would certainly vote and the additional 20 per cent said they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 per cent of the respondents would certainly participate and 15 per cent would probably participate. According to the current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would be no doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to registration fees in higher education, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees and 84 per cent would say no to hospital stay fees.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital stay fees, respectively.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent last year, unlike that this year the rate of VAT has not increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the Budaörs trade triangle, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, an increase of significantly higher value than a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, "who had already flown" into major food stores last December, have no longer increased sharply compared to the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but the prices of turkey, walnut and poppy have risen sharply.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but at Auchan, bread was found from one kilo to 139 forints only.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was amazing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the bottle recorded including.
Only this year, in terms of daily basket, Auchan was the most expensive and the least expensive Cora.
According to our calculations, Cora has increased the price of his daily basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan have increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing last year's most expensive basket and this year's cheapest basket, we see a 12 percent difference, while the difference between last year's cheapest and the most expensive one this year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices rose by an average of 1,206 forints, knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noted in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has perplexed trade, hypermarkets could not clearly determine what margin to apply on products as long as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the increase in daily basket prices has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was higher than the value of the 2006 basket, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forged.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was greater than 1 630 forints than last year and prices at the least increased by 1,284 forints as well.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we have seen a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer items have increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH's data: for some basic foods, the Institute of Statistics has seen a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of flour and egg.)
According to the daily basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have succeeded in accepting the brutal increase in prices also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at the prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long preserved food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning important tails formed at the boxes of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, turnover is lower in the province, many multinationals complain to poll companies not even to reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused mainly by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been registered in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also save on disinfectants
Not long ago, MRSA infection was diagnosed at the trauma department at János Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected on a man hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured person of a serious car accident left the hospital but shortly after he had to return there due to MRSA infection and since then the doctors have not been able to perform a major surgery because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Monitoring System nosocomiale, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One third of people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, tonsilitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) react well to antibiotics, they are easily cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop a well resistant antibiotic bacteria that will rapidly proliferate under poor hospital conditions.
In the event of a temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicaemia, on elderly patients, of small weight or having a weakened organism.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the hospital's daily life.
Above all, we should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only it or we do not look for it, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SAs resist antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the healthcare staff wear rubber gloves and protective masks and we have appropriate antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of MRSA infections could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and in homes for the elderly, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It is important to know that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases only occur if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the healing of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in outpatient and basic care, Karolina Böröcz said.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put gloves and protective masks. However, significant deficiencies are detected in hospitals also in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of epidemics, the patients should be removed from each other by at least 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, make savings on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the patients are numerous, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is less demonstrably or then the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSAs
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant spending on social security funds, which is why we fight this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has set up a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSAs.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) highlights among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of drunkenness
The official finding of the fatal accident caused by the 22nd arrondissement commissioner was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd district, who has resigned from his post since, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led to drunkenness or dizziness, communicated Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the capital after the relative finding has been established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation, which has already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before taking the wheel.
Last Tuesday, the former chief of the police station of the 22nd arrondissement crushed a 55-year-old man who stood in front of him when he shot, with his personal car, at Kossuth Lajos Street of the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian passage.
(In fact, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing does not constitute a mitigating circumstance, according to the Highway Code a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and requested his retirement because, according to the police, this accident has upset him a lot.
The investigation of this case is carried out by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated with the investigating magistrates from the outset.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Minister of Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest on Friday with a total value of EUR 400 million for a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund whose credit contract of EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties. This time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also concerns budgetary financing for education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later as a result of the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a contract of EUR 50 million for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the Metro Line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would reconsider the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary finalized the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of €8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans according to the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without a commitment commission.
Bulgaria, a paradise of the EU's real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans little mentioned in the past.
What, or who bought in this EU market that is always the cheapest but that will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
At present, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the cheap seafront.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sunside", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly searching for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also increasing to buy in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, business and office surfaces promise the highest amortization rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors already buy in large numbers, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are looking at the same time to change their life, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. Along the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, said Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old delapidated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, the proximity of a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since last December Bulgaria has been mentioned among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving a medium or long-term surplus value.
The price of the capital's buildings continues to rise as demand increases.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 per cent each year.
The increase in real estate prices mainly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six per cent Hungarian
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, professional meetings are ending on Tuesday, but on Wednesday, after the official opening, ministers' negotiations on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians coming from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the present time, there are strong discussions between developing and developed countries on this issue.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, it did not wish to discuss accurate figures, but was prepared to sign an agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent of 1990 levels up to 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit, without emission reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund set out in the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board of directors consisting of probably 16 members within the framework of the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
Six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as an flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to the 1990 level, regardless of the success of the signing of the "Post 2012 Agreement", and was prepared to reduce them to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to make commitments tailored to their responsibility and capacity.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the countries signatories to the Kyoto Protocol had a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members of that time made a commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The challenge is great in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system whose need was highlighted in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body, which obtained the Nobel Peace Prize of the United Nations to deal with climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the Earth's average temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
The British Army units communicate on the video-sharing site recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with a view to becoming popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) that was passionate about YouTube: special units in Afghanistan have been uploading video footage of Taliban operations since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken with miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are checked at the Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to London or the compatriots upload them to the Internet.
The political message is essential
Air force soldiers have already passed 139 net sequences through this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and broadcasts videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were posted on the net to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to publicize the actual objectives of the military presence abroad.
The propaganda published by this channel costs virtually nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, communicated to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, but it also inevitably carries a political message because it justifies in a special form the validity of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army is embarrassed because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have been posted on the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, somewhat hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already been posted on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently packed up for the loading of these videos.
The Americans make the recruitment a little differently using the America's Army shooting game downloadable for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tambola and doughnuts in ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking doughnuts and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a party with live music, another will enchant civil servants with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so the power is fun.
The public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the employees of the Ministry who will be invited to attend.
At Christmas, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, the family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Department provides a budget of 25 million forints to create the end-of-year atmosphere.
In comparison with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are celebrating.
The GKM festival will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees in bulk, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a rumble.
The Christmas of the NFÜ cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and dinner.
The room rental cost 1 million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party which is organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a company managing tenders.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté has been rented for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we failed to reach the person in charge.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, organized a dance on the occasion of Saint Luke on 7 December.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
This ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's welcome words and dinner was followed by a dance evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the evening party was not mandatory at all at this dance.
The ministries of health, work and local communities are preparing a sober holiday.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a feast for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his collaborators to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have coffee and to eat doughnuts, the press service has been informed, the party will not cost as well as 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Authorities, will simply invite his collaborators to have a drink in the classroom of the Ministry of Local Authorities and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will host a Christmas party in its large room with 436 employees expected.
It plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas each year in the same way.
No party atmosphere expected, the official character is reinforced not only by the minister's presentation but also by the hour of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the Town Wood, and according to the Ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the 100 guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started with a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, they communicated the respective press services to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the event at the Musée de l'art décoratif.
The forces of the mega strike gather
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will set up, on Friday, their strike commission, which will be responsible for coordinating the strike for an indefinite period of Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest meeting will be held and on Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Fund Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause important traffic caps as rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
The League Unions will make known, Friday afternoon, the details of their strike on Monday, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike commission will also be formed, it will serve as coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general protest meeting will be held and, starting on Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in Parliament on the Health Fund Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Fund Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on further action.
According to the National Assembly's Monday agenda, it is likely that the vote on the Health Fund Act will take place only late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, important traffic closures are planned: railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport to Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies are likely to be stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for strike, the list of which is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report taking the strike for an indefinite period, while others reported a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Trade Union of Roads (VDSZSZ) failed to reach an agreement on minimum services, but, as Christmas holidays approached, more and more are taking the train.
According to current communications, Budapest's public transport will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the League's Industrial Electricity and Thermal Energy Unions will strike for four hours, the Teachers Union and the Democratic Teachers Union have called for a strike for two hours and two hours to eight hours respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternately, the Health and Social Workers Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, made by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be implemented from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that the functions that deserve to be passed on to the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Road Trade Union (VDSZSZ), attached to the League Trade Unions, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased risk country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországert Mozart (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", the company notes that, in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur as a result of the worsening ethnic tension already existing between the Gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary".
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to provoke this situation is the main reason for this.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and Hungarians".
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular regarding the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and extreme right groups since autumn 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 giving themselves the name "national self-defence association".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization when they publicly declare the preparation of their adherents to defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, moreover, by referring to the incapacity of the police, the army, in other words the state," they added.
They pointed out that everything was going on according to the method which, based on the grudge of the political society and the parties, sought to disguise different political ambitions in a civil aspect.
The emphasis on civil character and association status is therefore only used to avoid the legal traps of registration of such associations in court, but it is also a political strategy.
The analysis points out that the Hungarian Guard's activity is a factor that also increases the risk from neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultranationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the Hungarian Guard's constitution is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, and political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard is, for example, similar to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous Roma riots that broke out in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) led to the constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
In taking advantage of these events, UNB decided to set up a guard, saying that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
According to them, in the last 17 years, the gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had generated intense debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement of some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the establishment of their own guard as resistance points to an increase in the risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not preclude the Hungarian Roma from reacting to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defence, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year, and if events occur that may have an impact on risk change, they inform public opinion, as in the present case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party isn't marked red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holiday days and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganise the working days whose number will decrease next year.
Holidays are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays and rest days.
Days of rest are often linked to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year ending and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that the alarm clocks can rest quietly.
Moreover, in a year, we have in all eleven red-marked parties.
March 15 is a national celebration, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, as on October 23, also which is the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1st is the labour festival and November 1st and 2nd, we remember the members of our family and our deceased friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the feast marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school the Saturday before extended weekends.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been acting in special regulations on days of replacement for days prior to or following holidays.
The law extends to all employers and their employees, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
It does not apply, however, to service companies, institutions that rotate without interruption and in service, by virtue of their vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, working days will be modified only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life stops almost throughout the country because according to experiences the majority of people do more hours or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes in order to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many parties fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The schedule will be reorganized the first time around the work day to allow employees to stay home four days in a row.
Saturday, April 25 will be a day of work to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for October 23rd: Saturday, October 18th will be a working day replacing Friday, 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can terribly annoy colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: these are things that "beautify" the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether we get used to these problems or face the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called marketing service," a colleague said.
That you missed an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, this is arranged with excuses.
Before you have painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Do you borrow anything that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, a desktop tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost in your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking otherwise they're right to be angry at you for stealing their good.
Don't bring any envelopes, post-it into your pocket because it can be annoying that there is no more envelopes and that you need them right away.
Are you talking about your colleagues' privacy?
There are no good ways to stop propagating bros.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone about your colleagues' privacy information (subpositions)!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don't abuse his trust!
Bury shared information within you and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
You're saying you're sick for no reason?
When you call the office and you say you're sick on the pretext of a heartbreaking headache because you feel bad or you think you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent business, your futures must be done by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you won't go to work or that something could happen that would force you to stay at home, don't forget to warn your boss and colleagues to keep them from being surprised by your absence the next day.
Ironing, Grinding, Telephone
You're getting into your work, but your coworkers' reinvigoration gets you brutally out of it?
Have you become, without wanting to, a witness to a telephone conversation that you would have done better not to listen to?
Don't bother your colleagues with frowns, chantings, high-voice discussions (which you lead over their heads), foot beatings, big words or discontents expressed with a loud voice.
They may disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
You're accusing the others of a mistake?
If your work is not done for the specified time limit, you forget to send a mail or an important message, accuse no one for that forget!
Do not put it on the account of possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognise it if you have made a mistake and if it has caused inconvenience to others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix the negligence!
Do you feel too much at your office?
Putting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they are not suitable at the office!
Don't put on a comfortable jogging even if your function allows!
Don't be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by wearing nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're not interesting anymore.
We move slowly into the usual morning cap.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm putting up the sound.
Music changes rhythm and bass arrives to accompany the tones of all time, then a female choir joins it as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts the song Wings of Love de Zagar.
Hungarian music has not spoiled us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the plug becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground, are gradually beginning to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of the garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electroropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he threw himself on his own path, perhaps because "there is no place for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The training in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the magazine wan2 cited their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important records in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his ensemble have become unquestionably "trendy" but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The band reacted properly, it released a new and better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, can open new avenues for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from the former group of Pécs de Balázs Zságer.
We are well there with the reference to flight but next to air music appears now, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the strongest guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first album in the Parc Millennial.
On the album, we find a real tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, which has recently broadcast popular music from morning to evening, started to introduce the songs of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's okay.
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: did your music remain a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The music so-called alternatives, underground can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere too.
The reception attitude also operates in this spirit regardless of the language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either one more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Outside, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only young people about ten or twenty years old but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course I'm glad to see that people come to our concerts more and more.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us music is not meant to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important at concerts or mutual influence already works, but it is perceived only in the inseparable changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to meet the public's expectations, you wouldn't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Are you planning to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked alone and made a career in the west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even if sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who trust each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, it was quite inevitable that our music be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are several to leave his group and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the list of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love takes the first place.
Many have heard Zagar's name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style, have you consciously opened to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube to be able to sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the final of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the album.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the six-member choir, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, who was then baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This song already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing from this song.
The sequence of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same song the night the girls learned later.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me back then, but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have a role alone, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were behind the stage too.
Is that what you wanted?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we have to forget a little bit about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted the others to also feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which song made you the most work?
Zs.B.: Actually, none of the musical creation process we had more difficult songs during the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for long, and then, little by little, everything set up like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already "dropped" this record.
Right now, they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Trader perfide at risk of billions because of its inferiority complex
A cover-up fraudster.
Thus its former employee is the French giant, the Société Général, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank has lost nearly EUR 5 billion because of it.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equalize his colleagues, and who, in addition, cannot be considered incapable at all.
Unlike all the big banks, he recognized in time the crisis of the American mortgage market.
"He's fragile," said his superiors who denounced him to the police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel's statement reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions produced a profit of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
The crisis surpasses the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to win half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called "sub-prime" mortgages granted to low-income customers or those who had experienced difficulties in the past with repayment would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he put it right.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Since I had won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel says and adds that he, of course, didn't keep anything for himself."
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he has misreported for not being detected.
He succeeded in duping his superiors, although the Eurex scholarship began to focus on his transactions.
There's nothing at risk.
Was he afraid to be discovered?
Rather not.
"I thought the mere fact that I got $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did his will come from to risk so big?
He reached his post only gradually.
He had started working at the Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant trader and, in 2005, became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90 thousand.
Yet he knew that he would never win as much as the others.
"Since my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university curriculum and my professional and personal career," Kerviel told investigators.
However, shortly after his entry into office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he won half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this title during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you alone.
"There was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they were aware of it.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
But that's when the start of the year comes.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to raise 365 billion
Yesterday, the Ministers of the Czech Government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which in the coming years could bring EUR 14 billion (about EUR 365 billion) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion kroons from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion kroner under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain in the context of these projects.
This money will be the source of an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion kroner next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme, for SMEs and entrepreneurs, must be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new and more efficient management methods.
To date, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the EU's least successful beneficiaries.
The Tribunal confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed on Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of the country Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million fraud (nearly 1.8 billion kroner).
However, he was later released and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be incarcerated again is not at the moment, according to AP agency, clear.
According to the President of the Ileana Pérez Court of Appeal, everything will now depend on the prison officers, or they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or else go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved the government's money to foreign company accounts in Panama.
These were fictitious societies and the accounts were actually owned by family members and their closest supporters.
Part of this money went to the funds that Alemán had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's right.
The State budget was adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse it.
Unlike the agitated debate before the vote on the government's declaration of defiance, this time nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies has adopted this law without any problem, which, although most influential, is usually neglected.
Here's some sort of paradox.
Whether you want it or not, each chapter and article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of the policy, although hidden behind the competition for power between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why more attention is given to it in the media.
Politicians' disputes are much more of an issue than abrupt figures.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments suffered from three evils which the current budget is not able to settle at the same time:
The first is the significant share of the statutory mandate fees, not only for retirements but also for social expenses, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit in the state budget that represents the greatest threat.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real delay bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued staggering bonds, debilitating their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from the money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past few years, they were able to repay these debts through the mass sale of the shares of the distribution systems, particularly those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatizations.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If only the official and verifiable facts are taken into account, it is noted that:
Our economy has been going through for several years, just like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD do not fail to sell out.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, however, they were increasingly in debt to the state.
Other countries, apart from some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls primarily on previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which have, precisely in recent years, unfortunately become unnecessarily inflated.
Although some of the absurd populist spending, approved last year prior to the elections, has been eliminated, if the age limit for retirement and reform of the pension system are not forthcoming, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and anyone in power will only be administered.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes regular costs to be pushed back by mandate costs.
The deficit of 70 billion planned for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we really don't want the policies in power to become mere bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it can take in taxes and tax rights, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to resolve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to combat the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will thus be placed on monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to auctions and, in addition, it will provide 24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks on 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided on a concerted action to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote in his report to clients Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group consulting company.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unreimbursed loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for further losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, they must really understand what can still follow," says ABN Chief Economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he adds.
The Central Banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The Central Banks made this choice after the interbank rate of Londrès, called LIBOR, which was used to borrow from the interbank market, has not been reduced.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the US, Canadian and English Central Banks had repeatedly decreased their interest rates during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further decline in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Banks' approach will not help to curb the crisis, as it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the USA.
President Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is expected to be particularly detrimental to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
This time, the criticism fell on the United Nations international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not green, he stated that the debates of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mixture of representatives of Governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the accompanying rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a rocket of words, ersatz of solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President pointed out, in presenting his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often only meet the caricature of my opinions".
From now on, interested persons can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, he nevertheless felt that he had sufficient arrangements to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic capable of following and appreciating scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following: the climate is constantly changing, the changes in the climate are therefore normal, there is not a shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they are therefore no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
Especially since he had experience of a totalitarian regime, he considered it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he felt as a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to the questions of the persons present, he explained on several occasions that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this topic two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their former driving licence whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day when people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities are able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of unlicensed drivers will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving licences, especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While the municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, the authorities in the capital are invading applications and the number of licence renewal applications has increased this week.
The City Hall meets approximately 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail about half an hour or so.
In Prague, nearly 140.OO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request deliverance within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays a supplement of five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to complete the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and will be on the road without a valid licence will be liable, as early as January, to a fine.
The offender will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence through a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine is increased to 2500 kroner.
According to old information, even a person who was not going to travel was liable to a fine.
By doing so she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
However, according to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one would risk fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's licence is, in his view, a document that people can decide whether they want to have it or not.
It is not as with the identity card that, it, must be valid without exceptions.
Those who no longer wish to drive should return their driver's license.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the sentences of detectives with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koñařík, former police officers accused of connivance with David Berdych's gang, will be jailed for thirteen and ten years respectively.
The Prague High Court has thus definitively condemned them by reducing their sentences by 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the detectives of the Department for Combating Organized Crime were at risk of 14 years of imprisonment and 12 years of imprisonment.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is awaiting only the verdict of first instance.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials exceeding 16 years in prison.
He can't receive any more.
In January, the departmental court found 19 persons guilty of holding hold-ups, and the superior court now dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Since the beginning of the investigation, most of the accused had questioned the charge by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police members, after an agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang returned 30 percent of the larcin to Opava and Kořařík.
In the prosecution, the criminal activity of the gang was discussed in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially, armed robbery, which victims in most cases suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibited weaponry.
During house searches, the police discovered illegally detained pistols, shells with a steel core, a laser direct-fire viewer or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang was enriched with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other armed robberies raised by Berdych and a whole range of others.
Other men in Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived until the court.
For the time being, the main hearing has prevented Tomáš Pýta and Maroš Šulej from being detained in Ireland, where they await the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: 12 million
Counsel for the families affected Igor Veleba wants to obtain compensation of 12 million kroons plus the costs from the hospital in Třebíč.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer at the Ondřej Dostal hospital is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," Dostal said at the exit of the hearing.
"To be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party commissioned to draft.
We'll see if this one has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostal said.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablosov family demanded a million crowns for each month when they could not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the university hospital in Prague-Motol, as a document in support of the compensation negotiations.
According to psychology and psychiatry experts, parents suffered psychological harm and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better supported by men, although they have been confronted with the remorse of not having been able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in the news and in the face of what is happening precisely at the moment, has summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at Třebíč hospital on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablonov.
The governor of the region Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil handed back, at the end of October, to each of the families 100,000 crowns for the reimbursement of expenses caused by the error of the hospital of Třebíč managed by the region.
All hospitals in Chechnya are legally bound to civil liability insurance.
In the event of failure, they must draw from the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may request assistance from the manager.
To date, the courts have recognized relatively small compensations, the amounts calculated from the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he had used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former employee of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his parasitic team on Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comic.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There's a job behind us for almost ten years.
"Looking for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who used the title Valašský král (King of Valašsko) for the first time in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this had no bearing on the plan to establish a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of making the passports of Valašské Království appear.
From a humorous action at the beginning, a business and a lucrative commercial activity came out, followed by the creation by Harabiš of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka agreed that his name and signature should be included in the passport and even proposed to the holders the price of the visit of his farm and theatre shows.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the manež broadcast, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské Království project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team who devoted themselves to the project in an intense way.
The collaboration between the parties today enemies continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka an official coronation in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, who culminated in the deposition "of King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šulaková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, asking that the court today rejected it.
What could make the case clear is the tournament planned for the throne and half of the princess.
He should get a new king out of it.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to go fast in need.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for some time.
Even Mr. Polívka can obviously register," added Harabiš.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: disappearance of prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its bearing qualities were not extraordinary, the quality of speed change, driving and also manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as lower than average.
At present, however, there is its successor Peugeot 207 on the market, which is much better.
Especially since the combi named SW goes a step further, I have only to think about it better.
When I was testing the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained, for example, about the head space on the back seats.
While there end the complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will, in this regard, be comfortable.
Let's go see it soon.
I'm going to go over the inside very quickly so I don't have to repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only comment on the central tunnel that seems to me to be poor.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when you could complain about too short seats or folders is over.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in body size is also sensitive there.
The combi also sees the lack of place over the already mentioned head disappear.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear swivel ice) and a rather easy arrangement.
The blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold quite heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
It does, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is in relation to competition a rather average figure.
Apart from Škoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle of this category in Chechnya.
Compared to 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, it can be seen that Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to leaving on leave abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to highlight the advantages, I would mention the remaining bottom of the body after the back seat backs are overturned perfectly straight, or a very low footpath.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The automobile we tested was equipped with an Otto engine of four cylinders with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what should look like a 1.6 that makes a family hatchback walk.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda that often gives the impression of having an exhaust bottle blocked by a mop, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's go through the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a fairly well equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an engine Otto 1.4 litres of 329 900 Kč is still fair.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80 000 Kč.
However, we have arranged in addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic ice wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs 531 900 Kč at the end of the day.
That's a lot, but try to add to Fabia's price the extra equipment and you'll get a very similar figure.
So there's nothing left to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is not well done
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concern among those who remain about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the inhabitants of origin turn into violence.
The case of the Northern Kent, where the continuing and immigrant conflicts of Slovak origin are beginning to intensify, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The disputes, the chicane and the fights between the students have been incorporated into the relations between the parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested in Chatham a Slovak woman who was hitting a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The perpetrator defends himself by claiming that the boy insulted him by racist words.
The police also had to intervene as a result of the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two adolescents.
The girls had allegedly sent racist remarks to this man and threw stones at him.
"When we got home, a young man climbed the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then discovered his buttocks," another unpleasant adventure described a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went to qualify conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between the inhabitants of origin and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your leave can be realized if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you are not going to find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Columbus described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana has become the repository and place of transhipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and that they were transporting to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American Mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the United States (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients, there were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings pushed and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50's of the last century, were circulating on the large boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
The stars of America's show business and politicians left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph yourself on the walls of Havana's Bodeguita.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are still circulating in Havana, as the jigoulis and fiats once imported have long been in such a salty, wet, rotten climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decimated, nowhere else in the vicinity are there as many splendid colonial monuments as there are right there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Given that tourism brings money if necessary, its development has a green light.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have pushed not only to Havana, but especially to Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the extensive plantations in the sugar mills on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how small locomotives can be seen on the move, whose contemporaries are not only elsewhere in museums.
Where to direct his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most well-known places.
So there is no need to write long about Varadero or Havana.
If not to recall that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Viñales to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows on limestone soil.
Mogots, calcareous balloons and rocks rise in chandeliers from the bottom of the valley, and, from fertile soil to their entrails, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco is probably cultivated of the best quality.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
Perhaps someone will also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was shot.
Trinidad
Old town founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him glory and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the beauty and vitrine character of this small city.
Koloniální španělská architecture,výrazně ovlivněná pozdějšími francuzskými osadníky, if čtyři staletí teměřř nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is a place so far away that still in the 1950s of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on the sidelines.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over their head.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is worth visiting interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which animates itself after sunset and where music is only darkened in the morning.
Bark
Some refer to this village located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This view is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads that lead from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has included the eastern shell of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the world heritage list.
We make the best chocolate, at the church, there is the cross of Christophe Columbus (actually, it was created about a hundred years after the voyage of Columbus) and from the hill where the old castle-fort and the current El Castillo hotel stands, we see several mountain table, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Baie des troies and Isla de Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this could be filled with a number of pages.
Only, as we say, it's better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, states Americans
The lack of soldiers and equipment required, according to the United States, affects the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as it should be, representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland.
In addition to the growing protest by the Taliban movement, the eight States involved are also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies today.
While the United States has called this week through Defence Minister Robert Gates NATO troops for greater activity, Britain sees the strengthening of Afghan government authority and the intensification of development aid as a priority.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other being to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British defense minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety per cent
The activity of Afghan insurgents is, according to U.S. military data, the most intense in the past five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, to 60 per cent in Helmand Province, south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand troops in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of which are in the south.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are requesting additional helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
"We will have to give serious thought to the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as the ways in which they can be achieved," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop today made similar remarks.
"I am not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about eighty percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that lasted three days.
That is liabilities
In recent months there have also been conflicts between the countries involved in the issue if all the allies actually do their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
British tabloid Sun described German soldiers as lazy this week.
"The Afghan fanatics discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document complemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went to the counterattack by publishing a picture of a British crew during a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to one billion in 2009
The burden of a government debt of more than 84,000 kroner is borne by each Czech.
The total debt rose at the end of September to $842.7 billion.
The government had planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
As a result of a better-than-expected change in the state budget, the Department has reduced its projected budget to Kr152.8 billion.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic increased towards the end of September to CKR 842.7 billion.
During the nine months of this year it has therefore increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
From June, however, it has decreased by 13.4 billion kroner.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has thus confirmed its data on the debt of the State dating back to early October.
The burden of a debt of more than 84,000 kroons rests with each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has been in debt of more than 111 billion kroner.
"For the moment, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit expected for next year, one could cross the border of a billion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast for Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor is similar: "We could exceed the billion in 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that the policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Debts grow
The debt of the State consists of the debts of the central government and is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits in the State budget.
The State's debt is financed by treasury bonds, rent securities, direct loans or, for example, by loans to the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the State has increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
The external debt of the State has increased this year from Kr 1.7 billion to Kr 123.3 billion.
The debt of the so-called negotiable State reached at the end of September 803.3 billion kroner and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average debt liability of the State amounted to 6.5 years.
"The total debt has increased annually from the first to the third half of 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a much too high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by the rent securities where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debt grows, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be a matter of negotiation when the reform of pensions comes," commented the Pikora data.
Better than we expected.
As a result of the government's 2007 debt financing and management strategy, the government planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected change in the state's budget, the Ministry reduced the planned sum to 152.8 billion kroner.
The sum is essentially the deficit of the State budget, which is clearly going to reach 76 billion kroner this year, instead of the 91.3 billion kroner originally planned.
Secondly, these are the maximum planned sources for the Czech Consolidation Agency, i.e. 13.3 billion kroons, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state rent securities for 43 billion kroons and the repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion kroons.
She was now appearing before a court in Khartoum for having named a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, his lawyer said.
The British was accused of letting students aged 6 to 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was punishable by whipping.
This 54-year-old British teacher in charge of the Unit High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with violating Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students at the Ministry of Education of the Sudan.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years of age, to choose a name for the bear in teddy bear of the class.
"Eight names come out of the children's mouth, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their favourite name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the bear photo followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear any label with that name, but the problem is simply that of the prophet's representation considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues at Gillian Gibbons, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said, "this is only an "innocent mistake".
Opinion shared by many students of the teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never speak of religion in class".
Let's remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, he writes in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna on Wednesday.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was "at stake", his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence in the immediate but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist".
End of mediation on 10 December
The Troika ombudsmen, comprising the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo one last time on Monday.
The future of the province with 90% Albanian speakers could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final negotiating session since the Troika was entrusted with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence in Kosovo, insist on a continuation of negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, the Westerners believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina stands ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," said Kosovo's President of the Autonomous Authority Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" took place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovar rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to a past that led to killings and deportations".
‘Domino effect'
Serbian President Boris Tadic considered that a compromise was always possible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade says in particular that it fears a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should return exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto right.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be "in consultation" with the Westerners.
Bush breaks an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference convened by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to enter into immediate negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must put an end to its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the "road map" for peace that they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This name covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the US President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and thorough" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
In turn, Olmert committed to "direct and continuous" talks and "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for the implementation of its co-existing Palestinian and Israeli "two-State vision".
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment to this direction from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a success for Washington, was the source of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offered Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Saoud in his interview with Saudi-capital-based Arabic daily.
For the D.A., the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As every time in this type of fact, official versions and rumours oppose each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspectorate General (IGPN) investigation, a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, Louise-Michel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She wasn't in surgery but in patrol, and she was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without a gyrophare," says a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, "unapproved, therefore not allowed to travel on the public road" (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was circulating "very vividly".
"She hit the police car on her left, after a denial of priority on the right," says a policeman.
The control of alcohol on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (before deflated, starry windshield, torn bumper) is testimony to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "facts of involuntary homicide and non-assistance to the person in danger" to the IGPN, cosiness with the departmental directorate of public safety of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, excluded the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday evening, confirmed "the version of the police officers, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were stuck as long as the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsyed yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel that police officers would have left the scene very quickly, thus not helping the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out "any serious misconduct" with regard to this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation, on which one must be very careful," said a police source.
Liberation met an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows just pointing at the scene.
"We came down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them," said this witness.
There was nothing to do".
He then saw "a completely hagard policeman, who was drinking.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young, the fourth one was talking on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, apparently, with the certainty that the people present of the unexpected situation of the young, the police were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to this witness, the aid arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the police officers".
They also had heart massages in vain.
"I will not let you say that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
Fire department's here right now.
Everything was done to try to save them," the prosecutor pointed out.
Voltage rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police suppressed on Monday the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, approximately 2,000 lawyers who protested against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades used by law enforcement officials, according to witnesses.
They responded by throwing stones, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers have charged and injured lawyers.
Several were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court Bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations reportedly took place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
On Monday the lawyers' movement gathered the support of the religious parties grouped in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president '' urged the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the state of emergency and debris to those who took an oath before Musharraf''.
''Musharraf's promise no longer holds''
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly covered by the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday evening.
It was scheduled to take a decision in the next few days on the legality of the presidential re-election, on 6 October, by indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was evicted and replaced.
"Everything we see is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's rulings," said the magistrate in The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president ''no longer holds'' after the state of emergency was established, said the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15th, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy chief of the armed forces.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unanticipated
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and unplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one out of three pregnancies (36%) is not foreseen, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and unplanned or unexpected births.
The various methods of contraception such as pill or sterilide still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates the Ined.
The liberalization of contraception has nevertheless allowed for a better "mastery of fertility", according to the Institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
See calculated per month for one in five couples and if possible in spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky output that accumulated records due to its duration, its remoteness from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools "briked" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a large cylindrical piece to welcome the European and Japanese scientific laboratories soon (see box).
This module is a sort of docking dock for the laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was therefore to move a solar panel power generation module weighing 17,5 tonnes, already present on the ISS, to put it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began to redeploy the solar panels of the module, which have a size of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged about a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment was stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who originally had to perform an exit control of the Discovery shuttle, then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go caracolar after 30 meters of length of the remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
He is one of the best spacewalker (spacewalker) in Nasa.
Large, resistant, very apt, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At 46 years of age, this training doctor was responsible for "operation" of the solar panel "injured".
After precisely inspecting the damage, he cut off the faulty cable and installed some sort of "attalles" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who remained near the sas and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey cane wrapped in insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bricolated" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before inventorying its tools and returning to the station's interior.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the Discovery shuttle for a scheduled return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned in Stock Exchange
The EADS action is currently in sharp decline on the Paris stock exchange, after the aeronautical and defence group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its operational result forecast for 2007 following delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditioned the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to offset the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus,' announced the mother house of the European manufacturer EADS.
Because of these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without further details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS' operating result fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the polls: the Russians will choose massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days after the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends to voters a television message on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the united Russia list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be seen by receiving foreign ambassadors, simply delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favourite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, most transparent and open elections, elections without hanging," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from accounted for.
She's denouncing a campaign full of pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that "there have never been such dirty elections, even at the time of Yeltsin."
After the repression of last weekend's protests, the ex-champion of the chess world Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains prohibited from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo Sovietus"
Behind these unsuspended legislation are two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first presidential round on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to be announced.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot fight for a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and of the powerful united Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, to the legislature as well as to the presidential, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have maintained the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel master of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, goes back further: civil society has fallen behind in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine renewed with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "willfully renounce personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the outbreak of the USSR.
"What good is it to think?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) head the local lists of Russia united.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
Nor will the Russians vote for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: "What good is it to think about?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in open access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were available for consultation only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of an ex-victim or his successors.
The eleven States in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be carried out "in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, had opposed the opening to the public of these nominative documents because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some of the victims of deportation.
The records of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been compiled after war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, possibly, to prove their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual applications.
Yet, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for Research on Anti-Semitism at the University Technische Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission their green light last April to enter into negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to €60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the EU, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact for the two economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson justified.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its potential". The EU and India meet Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England notes concerns by offering £10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of 10 billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
"In order to alleviate concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected supply of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she says in a statement.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12:15 GMT, at the basic rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time that BoE has put liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These usually take place within a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it "is prepared to take further steps to maintain the rates" of interbank loans per day in line with its base rate.
The daily interbank rate was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate has been 6.6%, a higher rate since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the Bank of England has had a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from using it.
According to some rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the book compared to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse examination of PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist purchasing power bill on Thursday, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
In a socialist "niche" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined by about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the national PS office, including the 50% increase in the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport cheque or the rental supervision.
Since UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was adjourned following the general discussion which led to exchanges, sometimes lively, between the majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of MPs PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes into being
Following numerous rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the Republican Festival of British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is an honour to work with a person who has, no more or less, inspired the current festival movement in America," said Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is expected to be held from August 8 to 10 on a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the bar of Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to give the region a European-style event festival.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have become involved in politics because of the current administration, says Charlie Jones.
"Happily, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a superb festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in urban areas.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours are in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a rural festival to the European and urban to the American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports this event," said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states that "they are interesting enough to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the reception capacity of this festival is "very large", like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed when going to press.
"Vineland will taste rock, but music will be varied there, hoping to attract all sorts of spectators," said Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal Faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film trays to Montreal when none other than Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the function of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the "Governor" legs?
"Be careful, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the best ones they will judge," he says.
The Festival Race
For the time being, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of cinema here.
The Oscar race has begun.
It will be from all festivals on the West Side, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present the Quebec films, highlight them and ensure that the directors conduct interviews.
The Dark Ages had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year stock market rally? The experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks after the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands in hopes of the arrival of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year experts are not as certain as this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market generally has a positive attitude.
However, forecasts based exclusively on statistics should not be made, since, given the current context, uncertainties in markets, at least in the short term ".
Although they are not partisans for the stock exchange to take momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is fed by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the leak effect towards quality values both in long periods and in short periods".
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behaviour, not free of volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decline in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of the gross and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, responsible for sales of BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the best thing," says the expert.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock exchange index, has lost almost 4% since 8 November when the index closed to 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an Intermony analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points through the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur annually during these dates.
However, the expert notes that things will be a little different this year as he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the constitutional holiday bridge (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be provoked according to the information that comes from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximums.
Solana, from Intermony, says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some builders "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco assures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, if they do.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that the other builders such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
In the last seven years, only for two occasions in December was a low month.
The authentic end-of-year rally took place in 2003, during which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the drilling of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (for the time being the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds on computer on its end-of-year rally.
The People's Bank will open 200 offices open from Monday to Saturday
The People's Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in Spain's most commercial areas.
These branches, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it was the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8.30 pm, and to open on Saturday from 10am to 8.30pm.
Another group that also repeated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experience will be decisive for other organizations to join or not to join this initiative that coincides with business schedules.
This is precisely what the People's Bank is looking for.
Attracting self-employed customers who travel in these areas to shop in SMEs and street businesses chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies throughout Spain in about 18 months, since this is not about opening new agencies but about renovating existing ones.
To this end, the agency will modernise the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the hours is accompanied by a different design of the inside of the branch and a new, more modern design with brighter colors.
The commercial bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renovation does not involve major investments, but hiring staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The People's Bank has already tested its initiative in three Madrid agencies.
And the experience was positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The streets of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and with success, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very large schedules, which open even on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We do not want to compete with our customers,' notes Rivero.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with external staff at the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock exchange value of its rival Antena 3
We made it.
With this sentence Paolo Vasile, a delegate advisor of Telecinco, expressed yesterday his satisfaction, at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect tarnished his joy: 'what hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but we have decreased less', he said.
However, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen' less.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain stabilizes its loss to 15.66 per cent for a year.
The stock exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento ( 13% more) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which surrendered yesterday 1.52% and accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other communications companies listed on the stock exchange is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is because we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we profit from it in terms of hearing. '
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel this year to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as Giuseppe Tringali, the delegated advisor of Telecinco and Publiespa, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group, assured.
In order for this announced data to be real, the television channel is expected to record an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing compared to the 965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, the net billing of Antenne 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (up to 734.4 million) while net television revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco in Stock Exchange is the important payment out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
' We have the official compromise to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market is now showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in projected income growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company decreased the forecast for the earnings of Antenne 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecuritys recommends buying both values based primarily on its high profitability of dividends and its long-term sustainable potential.
2.
The Caja Madrid sees Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antenne 3 (maintain) for the ' multiple attractions' and the increase in business.
3.
JPMorgan: It recommends examining both cases since it has had 'like threats' (a saturated market and a bad economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which came into force on 1 November
In parallel to its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the Congress' vote on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by members of Parliament and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the agencies to ensure that markets function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves modernising financial markets, as it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial advisory services for both specialized social reasons and for natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (FIAs), which merge securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which face competition from current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service undertakings to disclose information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and forms of risk management to the market and requires them to keep a record of all the transactions they carry out in order to facilitate the control of the CNMV.
In passing through the Congressional Economics Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which shows that securitized debts will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has proved itself with the debt of high-risk US mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of management to legally delineate the functions that graduates in the Economy may be 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which delineates the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to provide its product marketing services and attract new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index increases from five tenths in November to 4.1%.
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to include it in the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonised Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is indicative only, because it should not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed on December 14.
"The CPI will continue on relatively high levels"
The second vice-president and the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "temporal figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has specified in the Congressional corridors that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential on monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," acknowledged the Minister of Economy in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock €42,000 million over three years
The Northern Rock deposits have fallen to more than 50% to £12,000 million (16,800 million) since he got into crisis around mid-September and had to use an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time he raised some record deposits over 25,000 million pounds, a figure that gradually fell in two and a half months due to the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with its Virgin Money financial trade mark, needs to seize around a quarter of the revenues of the British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain the remaining 18,000 million pounds until reaching the goal of 30,000 million.
The Richard Branson Group, known for its advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend £50 million (about €70 million) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin Association, in which three other companies participate, including her favorite to save him from the bank road.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for an alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
AIn addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the Chief of Police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the me of May last Juan Morales, current Member of the Right, and until then municipal councillor of the town hall, who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'leader' of this plot.
The officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urbanism Council and there is no deviation from the possibility of further arrests in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, was charged.
As stated yesterday by the SER Chain to the lawyer of the MP 'of the popular party' Juan Morales, he was arrested when leaving Morales's home with important documentation in his possession regarding the plot.
Moreover, according to sources of the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to requalify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight detainees.
Bono agrees to be the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the top of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
Thus the secretary of organization of the Spanish socialist party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the Socialist group who will preside over Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who on November 15 released his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his political career in the fight against climate change in the academic context.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, although citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to transform the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or cry" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on certain occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his ability to do" and he did not want to do as if he was already in his position to avoid falling, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider as "a domination".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to unmerciful persecution both the skeptics of its predictions and those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron consistency.
This is all the more so for a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even intends to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to ensuring that Spain is at the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who are responsible for non-execution, in which sectors it has occurred and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, he must clearly explain to the Spaniards what steps he will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will we have to make, what economic consequences it will cause.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it's about sacrifice and payment.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costy, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Until the one hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him to be so dangerous in Zapatero that he rushed to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he does not speak, does not denounce and does not demand, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not claim that we move on a bicycle or cool with the fan.
Mayor and Chief of Local Police of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the mayor's secretary and a suspected hotel contractor for possible urban crimes, today informed the sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hall, where at the moment many agents met, who also presented themselves to the Municipal councillor's office of Urbanism and to the municipal management company of the Industrial Sol and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 housing units, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Totana Court No. 1 investigates.
The first six detainees have now moved to a judicial provision.
According to the sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently autonomous MP of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and the entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Souelo de Immonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the bribes would have been realized.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Thus, only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, which could have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex of the Totana municipality, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which has been requalified, and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages Vigo's car parks in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico's square; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's comment published in Finland's most important newspaper (certain PISA news headlines above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day it appeared there, curiously, the critic of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy course called on public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the dead, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers take a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and said that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.

A colleague passes the information on the introduction in the Criminal Code of Crimes on Internet Downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by a term of six months to one year.
On the other hand, the theft in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros is considered only a mistake (Article 623.1).
B. The theft in a store for a value of up to EUR 1,000 is already considered an offence, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for the download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a three-month to one-year sentence (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a six-month to two-year sentence
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to section 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected films without author authorization is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).

My treating doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
In other words, the feelings generated by monthly workers' pay depend on what colleagues gain.
The study was carried out with tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the neurocognition imaging group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed."
The researchers observed that when the two people became that they received the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received double activation, activation was greater.
I don't know if that conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years since the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of Srebrenica's murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims have died-, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in this list whose documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'the Carla list' (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade in New York who pursues criminals on the run and puts pressure on the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What kind of insurance do I have?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, involves a significant expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driver's licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use thereof, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And it's just that choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
And that's because choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is realized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use, among others.
Insurance companies set prices based on statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rate to be paid.
It is for this reason that people over 25 and women must pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of claims than to their own prudence.
Similarly, using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the probability of an accident.
By increasing the frequency, probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must study the situation in order to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 must face various disadvantages when making a contract with insurance at an affordable price, as can be the low experience in driving and driving licence seniority.
Although the ideal to be well insured is insurance at all risk, other more cost-effective options exist.
The most anticipated drivers can opt for risk insurance free of charge, so that they get insurance coverage at all risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the client pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," says Luis Noguera, the head of Spain of First Europa, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but for those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid accidents to the extent possible, as this will impact on the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the company's basic rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses, " explains Noguera.
Beyond the age of 25 it becomes easier for drivers to enter into a contract with insurance, since the rate of claims is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is preferable to choose any risk insurance with franchise.
"Normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience previously acquired after an accident", says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, after passing the 'fear of the novice'.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is best that he negotiates insurance at all risk, as long as his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be those with the lowest rate of claims, because the increases will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be insurance at all risk with deductible (may be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have more casual driving and they have greater purchasing power to afford themselves the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchises," Judge Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, insurance at all risk with franchise is preferable (this is 150 euros), or extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that motor insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, that is why it is essential to study properly the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth finals
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are measuring next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians total ten points and have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a zero match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass it to him.
These two games of Group D will be played one week before the sixth day ends, since Milan AC must fight the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the final of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero match at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although both teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would remain first and ensure a better crossing in the eighths of the final.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to rank if the Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it won't be able to computer only on this because with nine points the game comes back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scottish, who have good hope of graduating for the eighth final for the second time at the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
While waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to the Shakhtar, in case the Celtic would lose, to rank for the eighths of the final in order to continue the league of UEFA champions.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators since the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before starting their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "brillant".
Around 20,000 people have exhausted the tickets to attend the concert, which was the subject of a video telling the story of the band that was furious at the end of 1990.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls went on stage showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had offered them, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the public that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about the show."
'Sporty Spice' which was part of the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings have changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "things have arranged and we really appreciate it."
But a lot of things have changed since the Spice Girl last showed up in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines aircraft.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of baby sitters was waiting for them.
They count to her five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will exhibit on 23 December.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine throws the alarm.
A dispute over the price of fermented gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of impact on oil exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The last fight between Kiev and Moscow occurs after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia's monopoly-owned gas supplier, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase as planned, its prices in Ukraine since it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts stated that this would involve an increase of 40% in the costs of imports from Gazprom for Ukraine.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas transits," Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, thus increasing prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the EU's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve controls on its extra community employees to verify whether they have criminal precedents, said the Monitoring Committee.
The Director General's warning, Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health does not have any specific data on the number of people overseas it employs.
However, his report highlighted other decisive controls, which were properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The reviewer general carried out checks on the extra community staff following the attack at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin at Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital, was arrested at the airport after dark with his jeep, at the gates of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October because they were suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be certain of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal checks, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that the committees are required to confront the Office of Control of Criminal precedents, thus enabling employers to undertake controls on various countries.
"Although we have discovered that some information about staff has been properly verified, this is not done at all times," the report says.
Mr Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he also added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, said that it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls could identify employees who might commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities stated that they employed 1161 people overseas, mostly from doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor General stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, partly because of problems with the identification of indeterminate contract staff, who may or may not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for monitoring health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lotian are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its pre-employment control policy and system for staff across the ocean in the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this job as a result of the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, together with the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report that should be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated and valid pre-employment controls for all employees, including overseas workers.

The 50-year-old director, having made films like Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of Crystal Cranium.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honour of star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney allowed people like me to access the cinema," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
"I was admirable in front of this great actor today, I was extremely honored"
The Oscars of the independent film, better known as "the Bifas", are awarded by a jury composed of actors, actors and festival organizers.

Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells handling an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks against clergymen and the armed forces.
State television from the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the missile smuggling cells.
The sympathizers of Al Qaeda have staged a campaign against the monarchy allied to the United States since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, said the TV newspaper.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 military personnel to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper citing a statement from the Minister of the Interior stated that 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell headed by a "missile launch expert" who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants planned the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees appear to have conspired the murder of ecclesiastics and armed forces.
The government asked the clergy to do more against Saudis led in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and against the Shiite Muslim government allied with the United States, considered heretical according to the hard line of Saudi Sunny.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiastics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
Activists, encouraged by appeals against the pro-Western Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months," said the Minister of the Interior's spokesman on state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina organized in a "media cell" aimed at promoting "takfiri thought", the ideology of the Muslim radicals Sunni that supports the use of violence against unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing activists.
Venus' climate could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live.
Data from the European orbital vessel have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those on Earth, and could even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface warm enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the probe of the European Space Agency, which studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth due to catastrophic climate change.
The professor of physics at Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We are beginning to understand why Venus' climate is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario according to which billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface."
An enriched uranium seized by the police.
One kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was hijacked by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three persons were arrested and that the equipment was currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the commodity would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he wasn't up to the table as a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates finally agreed to participate in the debate on You Tube, during which many ordinary voters who have recorded their questions, submit them to the candidates.
Wednesday evening November 28, none of the questions asked was as ridiculous as the one from another debate of You Tube, when a snowman asked the Democrats their position regarding global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have reflected much the conditions of the Republican party, candidate for the next elections.
We don't know what criteria CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose You Tube clips to show candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest one on one theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard funny things: The government raised approval increases when candidates spoke rudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is at the forefront of the important early elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked whether they would be prepared to promote an "amnesia" (providing the illegals a regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, succeeded in deepening this subject.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have begun to fight immigration before and in a more incisive way than the others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, together with the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys made in China, or other fears towards the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or to minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether to put water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in the contents of the Bible as a whole.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure to believe in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee was not expected to be in a position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, to declare the death penalty painful though necessary.
When one insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he began to laugh and said that Jesus was too chic to run for election.
The human race remains unwittingly open to everything.
Mr Huckabee's return to Iowa coincides with recent prodigious research on subsidies by libertarian Ron Paul, and whistles during Wednesday's debate.
These two are emerged from nothing, because the two party protégés fail to agree to decide who is the most well-known and traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party in good time and convincingly thanks to a message of success about the American greatness thus bringing the leaders closer together.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to sink; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the tendency of British scandals, it is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra-conjugal finger sucked.
But here's a revelation that a rich businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have gone through.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister turned back on his election project, foolishly insulting British intelligence by proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's buyback, a bank in difficulty on the edge of the crack, has shown a flaw in the guidelines and poor judgment in the event of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals for changing the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against reductions in military spending: they proclaimed that being a minister of defence is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of loose donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of the Workers (and his former head of vigilance) caused them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is moving towards the exit.
However, governments can arrive at a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but generally leave their doubts on the side when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: public administration no longer works; ministers' offices take stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any more purpose.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his superior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are linked to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes, such as the long investigation into the party's funds "cash money for the members of the House of Lords," voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown is not so tragic that she looks like it.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories party believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to realize Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies forever, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal about political donations is a good example.
Abrahams, a very special character, comparing his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it's not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the great subsidizers of politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know which contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who stated that he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, without knowing that it was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, in addition to Jon Mendlesohn, the person responsible for the collection of grants who had spoken of dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing suggests that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has made half of it.
He quickly condemned the legislative flaw of his party, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the power of decision is based on something he knows well, to resort to a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is within the jurisdiction of the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chair for the independent committee of Public Living Standards, without a leader for six months, and preparing for a good reform on the financial aspects of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to renounce its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative party now has a good advantage for the election; it has two years to win back voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see fins tickled, whirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measure or are not recoverable balance sheet shares, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its credit to the consumer, partly because of the weakness of card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the laws in 2005 in the United States concerning personal banking caused a steep fall in the bank road archives, which in turn caused heavy credit card losses; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly debt amount that consumers have to pay.
and the confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the emissions volume for 2007 would be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their debt now that fair real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flow than to the value of assets, and thus the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily lead to a change in borrowers' credibility.
They could even bring benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority to repay the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid resumption of actions.
"We're not going to wake up one morning and re-evaluate all the loans," said Gary Perlin, Capital One's director.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a substantial decrease.
If the lower prices of real estate and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Be careful with the dorsal fins..
The British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who had to go to testify their roles in relation to a fraud committed by Enron's previous financial director, Mr. Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had first declared themselves innocent of the seven charges of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They should appear in court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all pleaded guilty to a fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland's PLC group, became famous throughout Britain because of the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains an outstanding issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges imposed on them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation into Enron's debacle.
The accusations against the bankers, nicknamed the "three of Natwest" claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-wing arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him rig the banking procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary to be zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the subsidiary bank for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as an interest in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow allegedly falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, bankers would have won $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have won $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracys in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following a bail of $1 million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, banker-routed in December 2001 after years of accounting rigging, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its bidon speculations as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of redundancies, over $60 billion loss of market value and over $2 billion loss for retirement plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former President-General Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were unsuccessful because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
It's not ass, it's not ass, it's not ass, it's not ass, it's not ass, it's ass, it's as
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without stopover from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats as it is more of a family-use aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires' Fair, a four-day consumer-inciting orgy held in an enormous exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to attract the interest of the new rich Russians for their various products, ranging from acajou yachts to cars filled with diamonds such as those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was looking at a brilliant orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
"It's a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas"
"We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar from the Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies in the University of Harvard.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world's largest spenders.
The largest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are worth $670 billion overall, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the economic and financial research centre.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, London jeweller.
She participated in the show for the first time with the Russian distributor, the Soho Bijoutier Group.
"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking in the living room, Sunday evening, the two real estate agents placed on their 31st, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 say they are like their customers, millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who grabbed her high-couture dress as a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The living room seems above all to target the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in the plugs to come to a huge warehouse where are exposed Cadillac Escalades, platinum canies, Mövenpick ice creams, custom billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, proudly sitting at the Royal factory stand of Dutch porcelain manufacturing Delf, in front of a wall painting of Raimbrant on blue tiles, handmade.
"It is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, the sellers have stated here that the Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years old are too much according to Russian standards) have already switched brilliant logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not sell themselves at the salon.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, survey the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the King Koil bed CEO, stated that he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton inlaid with gold threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with last cry alarm systems, also stated that he sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant Orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customises luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded with Swarovski crystals so that it looks like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," Karapetian said.
It will certainly keep it in its garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the increase in real estate prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"there's more you could think of"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to Alliance Continental stand, a Russian heritage management company.
The company built four stands representing the British telephone booths, full of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 counterfeit tickets for the Millionaire trade show.
Passers arrested to throw masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or stacking up a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Karyev.
Unaccredited surgeon suspected of homicide in New Jersey
It was Thanksgiving's day before Ronald Livingston looked through the window bay of the Just a little Healthier restaurant and observed an ambulance that had just stopped at the white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol arrived.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Mr.Livingston, a restaurant manager.
That's where I realized someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to a gesture executed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon, which the police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Miss Arroyo's death, but they expect confident, the results of the toxicological tests that will, alas, take time, but which should allow to solve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo was the assistant police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenacious," McCarthy said about Miss Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"She was like a pit bull"
"she would have done anything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, and that she left two sons aged 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for the Union County Public Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine if Miss Arroyo died because of an unauthorized surgery.
"This is a possibility to consider."
"the investigation continues."
The authorities said they arrived at her house around 3 p.m.
and finding Miss brooko on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh was unable to confirm whether Ms. Castro was interviewed by the authorities.
The investigators seek to understand whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Miss Castro's house where a fanciful rosier rests in the narrow front cemetery, and a dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door leading to the ground.
Two all-terrain bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since she arrived in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Police Department, Miss Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
"She said, "you must pay attention to this," he said.
"She was there when I arrived, and still there when I was leaving.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates associated with the global stock market.
The shares are exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm down the credit conditions, subsequently reducing interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the vice president of the American Central Bank.
Stock markets explode in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, 2nd after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the agitated financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence has in part "inverted certain improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
Should this severe turbulence persist, it would increase the likelihood of subsequent rigid financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that further declines in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also allowed Wall Street to calm down with even worse news about the US economy, such as the biggest decline in real estate sales for October.
The impact of this financial turmoil was accentuated following Bear Stearns' statement, which announced that it would license 650 people, i.e., 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses caused by the losing bets of real estate loans.
Only 20 positions are planned in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55% to 13,289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points, or 2.7% reaching 6306.2, adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German index Dax increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted in response to the strong demand for a sale at monthly quarter-fund auctions from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the EB and to inject further funds into the London financial markets causing credit tensions, has caused the monthly sorting rates "Libor" the British banks, to cause their highest growth since September, to 6,59% following a strong upturn since November 12.
England faces an appeal to judgment against the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are facing two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number 6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the breeders who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because Hugh Morris's office, the CEO of England, begins filling out the application forms to become a national breeder, at least on part-time.
Anyone who does not succeed in winning Dossard No. 6 will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport is also unfair.
It is never easy to destroy what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never arrive beyond the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck more than due to lack of skill.
It is not only in the cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new executives who have obtained good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless given at least one chance?
The figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricketer of one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in full shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to win a seat.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 to the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer yet again.
If it's Shah or Bopara playing at the Asgiriya Stadium, it's just a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and succeeded in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricket of the Test, and that, despite the fact that his double-cent mark against Australia in Australia could still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and foster Shah's greatest experience against young Bopara's exuberance.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start to the 88 test innings in Bombay, 32 first-class cents against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah did only ten laps during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his Middlesex player town, and that, the immediate rejection by the breeders when Vaughan again in shape, demanded his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his elks so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex's player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket pitch and he overreacted when he recently capped on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, England's sponsor.
He only delayed minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at him from afar, to ask him if he had seen this?
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his spinning look allows him to do services that go to him, and that he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the true art of selection?
I'd be kind enough to give Bopara his chance, which doesn't mean Shah doesn't have to apply if, as tea leaves suggest, he'll be the one to play this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work, and fight against al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, spilling these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others hoping that the city has returned to normal.
Some have come back to fight the militants who have taken them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of buses from the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and since the city is safer now."
"They say the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to step away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the United States-assisted militia, allowed Al Qaeda to flee from the west of the capital, and invited him back.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he encouraged the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm coming home today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many say that they have attracted the increasing calm of the capital since American troops arrived, and in view of the continued formation of well-armed "groups of citizens involved" and collaborating with American military to defend their neighbourhood.
But still others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in the past years.
The 51-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai, the father of three children, expressed the suspicion of all regarding the visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, who would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people reportedly fled the country because of sectarian squadrons of death.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said retired Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decrease in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were driven out of Shia and vice versa areas, creating places where tensions are lower.
It is feared that a sudden influx of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest Federated State conducts vocational training, and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that there is a deficit on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-derision, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of the Saar, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics of Cologne.
Thus, by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This reflects the high share of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
Sarre also leads the children of the country to higher than average schools - many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
"In Sarre, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, IW training expert.
More than one in five young people get their degree from a vocational school, so the Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
Thus, the possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double-cursed panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of graduates in engineering has fallen by one third in recent years.
That's why the Ministry of Education has forced schools to have a marketing campaign in engineering science.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federated state.
For children to start learning earlier, the last year of crèche is legally exempt - a model that in the meantime other federated states also copy.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether the student's performance improves in a sustainable manner.
In PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of high-risk students decreased from 29 per cent to 20 per cent.
In total, however, Sarre has not improved as much as other federated states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And despite the great variety of genres, foreign language knowledge is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise we could gain points in this field.
Because the language of the neighbor is compulsory in high schools - even if the sarrois are not French.
Chavez adjusts watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon be ticking other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will bring the half-hour timer back to South America.
Chavez became a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated, as a result of a new law, watches will be set at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States had imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, as a result of a hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this, because of my dignity," Chávez said, who is in a hurry for a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The triggering element of this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate for negotiations on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "crashed in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Sunday Chávez.
In Spain too Chávez is in all the mouths.
A new mobile phone ring is furious in the country: "Why don't you shut up" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people downloaded on the internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was annoyed by the constant interpellations of the left-wing populists and told him to shut up.
A fall in wages threatened Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, according to a forecast, a real wage undervalue threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault is due to low wage development, higher value added tax and rising food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Research on Economics, in the newspaper "Bild".
New burdens could also be incurred in terms of unemployment insurance for the employee.
The Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the projected decline in unemployment insurance by 3.3 per cent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for funds or financial aid, as the SPD politician said.
On Tuesday, it was known that the boom in food and oil prices had pushed inflation to its highest level for 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from year to year.
Venus is the hellish twin of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere hostile to life, Venus looks more like Earth than we thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind whirlwinds at poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightnings on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has now brought proof of this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the lightnings on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous cyprine theory, lightning would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, an angle stone of life.
This is not the case with Venus: "If there was a life, it must have been at a very ancient date in history," says Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should be few living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the hellish twin of the Earth, but she's still a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venetian research, as no more probes had been en route for exploration of this planet since the 1980s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the commonalities with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than assumed at first sight.
In addition to the wind whirlwinds already known at the North Pole, the researchers found a cloud whirlwind at the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica italiana.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet described as an evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with a surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly recalls the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets have formed under similar conditions.
On both, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth in the form of carbonate, it constitutes on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the party's quarrel over the reception of the Dalai Lama at Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs because of the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and adds up to the great coalition to close the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue," Köhler said at Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the accusations that it would organise a new Chinese policy.
The German Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional politics of one China.
"China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly raised his dissatisfaction with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the CDU ranks.
Steinmeier complained in particular about the CDU's "front policy" on foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, virulent irritations became felt in German-Chinese relations.
Thus the Chinese government has not only decommissioned the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to Spiegel's information, has also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the Foreign Ministers of both countries.
The head of the government of China Wen Jiabao now requires German Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refused that European politicians would receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official duties, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The words and acts of the Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Street fighting with police, shootings, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not erupt in the streets through violence, the German Minister of the Interior demanded.
Burning barricades, breakers shooting at the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar evolution in Germany.
We need to ensure that a social explosive does not form part of our home and defuses itself into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "Neue Presse" published in Hanover.
Not all young people would be able to get away with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the Federated States and the communes were already working hard to reduce the problems, said Schäuble.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it already shows its first successes."
But it would be too early for an end to the alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time that in the German suburbs there are no sociological problems from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Paris agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned down.
The President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded greater efforts to integrate the German government.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, there would still be a need for action.
Kolat stresses that the proportion of unemployed young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than the average.
More training should be provided first and foremost.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective".
The President of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration also do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat urged: "But we still have to be careful."
Young people should be "avoided to be given the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, in the Parisian slum of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with projectors.
The authorities in office reported three arrests as well as a few burnt cars and garbage.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the slum.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 policemen were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the troubles went beyond Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor's utopian entry shows that the coalition has ended with the background - and that there is nothing left to wait for her.
Which country does this chancellor live in?
After his desolating intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, we must say: not here - not in the country that should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of overfocusing on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel from a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said, and she just showed that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, she made it clear to everyone how accurate that accusation was.
There was no concrete interest or feeling in the country's problems.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a sinner politician, who flees into foreign politics and even remains in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it welcomes again and again the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate goals will have to be achieved in our country.
Even, self - praise - having so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it again two years ago.
Now she's clinging to all-made formulas, which growth would affect people.
By this she destroys her image as a pragmatist, which solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the empire of the Angela cloud, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty among children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He has a few additional sentences left for that.
In this regard, it is revealing the number of times it makes lapsus when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three start-ups to pronounce a half-specified sentence.
She hesitates on unknown grounds from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack branch
In the debate of Youtube of Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle - and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates already bursts on the first subject.
He would have made New York a "refuge for illegals," says Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
"I would say that his own house was a haven for illegals," Giuliani replied and accused the former governor of Massachusetts of using undocumented immigrants.
The candidates go up to the attack: since the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users sent via Youtube are hardly more than blowers.
"It was with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," John McCain told his candidate Ron Paul who was the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also strongly taught by Vietnam's veterans when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go in the meantime beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture are seen in the reactions of the joint room in St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whether the conservative values are rented or future tax increases are denied, the applause is in the auditorium.
This is where once again the weaknesses of the two favourites are found.
"I made a mistake at that time," Romney contrit explained and apologized to the base and the television audience for still being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
On the contrary, Giuliani passes into a node when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil.
One day after his retirement as head of the armed forces, the Pakistani man of power Musharraf was invested as president.
Thus, eight years of military domination are over.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcasted the ceremony live to the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had transferred his post as Chief of the Armed Forces to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and had thus bowed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a putsch without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By this withdrawal from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on November 3.
Soon after his investiture Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus will meet another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers of its ranks, had rejected last week all appeals against the controversial re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghanistan border.
Krautrock's parents are making their way back.
The supergroups of Germany of the seventies rejoined: the three members of the Harmonia group again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return were released recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced at the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, at the age of 63, sits in the middle of a white shirt like snow.
It is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old boy with a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bows on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including even a Beat.
And sometimes it adds inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen too much.
The fact that the Harmonia group is playing again has ensured a few emotions among Krautrock's amateurs.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys reveal that, of course, the name lies in the collective memory of the pop, but in no way in such a long-lasting way that this group has been missing so painfully for 32 years.
But why would the German not also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is called deceptively "Krautrock" has always been more popular in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, the interviewing German pop faces were seen in the room.
When Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the surprise had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the Red Hot Chili Peppers scene as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown is the only one.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and that during this period, the impact power that felt was much lower than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We played first in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly found himself in Kraftwerk and finally made a name as a guitarist with Neu!, which was perhaps at the time the most radical German group.
By 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, in an ancient Weser farm, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence like Spitzweg.
So-called was in the trash a fan of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many keep Harmonia away from this.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next album "De Luxe".
As serene and modest as music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of the dead wood was not alone for the sake of self.
The "Live 1974" CD that just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as someone thinks they remember.
Rother expressed at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and assumed his existence with albums like "Flamende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster is revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe Griessem's Live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its Grönland label has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Neu! had already been buried on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of Krautrock's influence would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence glides in the room in the middle of the singular sounds: "The only true music, you listen to the future".
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photographs of wired tools in bazaar are used for the formation of the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by attaching microphones to the organ and battery, to pull the instruments from the sounds that are unheard of thanks to the instruments that have effects built themselves.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
All three of them in great tech fignores.
Even that the choir of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never been about rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in the music conservatories (Can), in the technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia also is no longer irritated by this now.
But what goes most of itself will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
This can hit someone's nerves (?) or give you fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Blood Peace", two films again address the Balkan War.
But they don't convince each other.
Both projects rely too much on action and on the exchange of senseless shots, or on the contrary they are too tearing.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: certainly the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is right there, in the most lugland of the war in Bosnia, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
Finally, we had lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because too many nice and futile roles in women's-feeling films and too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him with the desire to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why should today's films be as long and confused as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent representation full of blinks of eye: in the end, his war reporter character Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not as benevolent: a man who has his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruins to his decline, has nevertheless kept visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Blood Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless follow-up of missed films on the Balkan war.
"Deathless peace" is a quick trial: the film talks about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovar snipers, in which one of them falls still promptly in love.
Although it is welcome that Serbs here are not once presented as the only causes of all evils, this film as flat as a telefilm is lost too quickly in the action and exchange of senseless shots.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why in the end there has never been a real good film about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioned to track down the senior war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another writer (both Richard Shepard) at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories look strikingly alike: two males go on a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for the two males, it becomes a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we just don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as it is presented to us at first.
No, the script must also give him a romantic adventure with a Bosnian later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, through an accelerated process, manages to get NATO, the CIA and all the world's bounty hunters failed in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for just revenge to the Bosnian Muslims.
It is so bad that the Hague International Court of Crime against Cinematographic Logic should be seized.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to conduct the hunt in a fairly intensive manner because of secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and the wicked are this time so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
He speaks of an Asian demon's wooden mask on the poet's work table: "Compatible, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiresome it is to be wicked."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but they suggest how tiresome it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films on the Balkan War.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were big flops.
One can add: there have never been good films in South Africa.
What's worth every time: when a star hangs on a crisis home or on a minefield, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still just too close in time.
Anyway, decades have always passed before Hollywood can make a good holocaust film with Schindler's list.
Some films still have to mature - those who today value classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have in no way been celebrated unanimously at their time as masterpieces.
But maybe we know today too simply too much about the conflicts of the world, where every hecatomb gets live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this delights writers in the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not being" or "The dictator" have actually become as good because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you should have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionaire de Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only because some things never change".
"The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, the men will always be murdered in a horrifying way and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust collects criticism for the cancellation of the Olympiads.
The retreat of the mayor from Hamburg's candidacy for the Summer Olympic Games met with virulent criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of opportunities.
The chief director of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as many motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympiads.
"Without this objective, the political-sport momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find it a new starting point in the longer term, "which takes as its starting point another modified agenda."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday to his previous statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides to apply to the Olympiads, but the German Olympic Sports Federation" said Von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December, regarding Munich's bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that, in the period of time that we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not definitely belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
The impression of this would be that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close an opportunity, burying projects already now," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would also be in contradiction with the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in plenary meeting of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's nomination to the 2015 Universiades as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Fédération des écoles supérieurs du sport (Fédération des écoles supérieurs du sport) had first in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor's SPD fraction accused the Senate of not using this precious time in housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grassbrook was denied by the Senate for years because it played the Olympiads card and excluded housing construction," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for the Little Grassbrook an integrated plan in the Olympiads and a subsequent use of the housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event Factor".
The nomination for the 2012 Olympic Summer Games would have raised great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg had broken down against Leipzig.
They're not Warhols' boxes.
The one who connects the Swedish concepts and wooden case, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's works list.
A large part of the eighty-ten Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago questioned the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxes of 1968 by Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now results in a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", whose former director of the Pontus Hulten Museum gave a gift in 1995 at the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international art market.
The ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curatoric productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powder soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at Moderna Museet in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - presented hundreds of carton-made Brillo boxes: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather of their models, of exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time today speak of about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have entered law into the history of art and auctions, as original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 in auction sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hutén Museum wrongly claimed later that about one hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have handed over to him.
Indeed, the 105 caisses of Hutén were produced in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, next to the museum's six Brillo-Boxes, three other Swedish private collections, of which two were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sanded, then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
The texture of the copies dating back to 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the painting was directly applied without a layer of background on laminated panels, using a roll of paint - moreover, it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol's official Brillo-Boxes list," says Moderna Museet director Lars Nitttve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come up with another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exposure material."
Already in July, the Authentication Board of course announced that it would investigate the "thousand accusations" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since then there has been an inexorable silence.
The rebel soldiers of Manila abandon
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers abandoned, the same ones who had taken to a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
Soldiers who were loyal to power had shortly before stormed the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been cut off for hours in the building.
About half of them stood before the courts on Wednesday because of a failed putsch attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse himself with about 30 sympathizers.
Military police officers, who were normally supposed to watch them, apparently deserted in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops in power closed the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who commanded before the Scout Rangers' elite unit, said that other army units soon wanted to join the march.
The criticisms of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
Manila's financial district has already been the scene since 2003 of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The insurrection broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts at putsch against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a principal shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured more than 20 per cent of the Versatel telecommunications company.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as reported by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a buyback.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet has communicated.
Just before, suppositions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The credit institution would only hold the money for a third part, it is said on the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired almost 10 per cent stake in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of an increase in capital, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million in the stock exchange.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million euros for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephony.
"We are strengthening our partnership," said a United Internet spokesperson.
Both companies founded the MSP holding company to absorb the Freenet competitor.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent participation at Freenet, and not use their right to wear 18.49 percent extra at Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies would be left open to all options, especially to increase participation in the SA Freenet, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The poker still difficult to predict on Freenet that lasts for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers linked by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
United Internet Holding and Drillisch had a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 percent so far.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch would bring about four per cent more.
The right to purchase 18.49 per cent of the Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
