Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the Criminal Code section condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the minister, but the parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of a disadvantageous agreement with Russia for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet final, the appellate court has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, which sentenced the former Prime Minister, was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for approval.
Libya's Victory
The story of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
It remains to be defined who the winner is
As is customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it's about clarifying whether it's moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has brought into force the traditional law, Shariah, which we know in some way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate themselves and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, society, composed of warrior tribes, will unite by the Koran.
In Libya, an order will be established that we can't imagine and that we certainly can't.
However, our way of life is neither the only or objectively the best and probably not suitable for the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters would accept gratefully the help of unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, in their view, NATO attacks did not lead them by an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each successful intervention.
When they seek winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting that Islamists and our politicians are using to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
Following recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem expelling the "crosses"
But, without occupation, will the oil tankers get made with Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible not to, but it may be that the West can finally presume to protect human rights.
Whenever the followers of the sharia don't cross us.
A new era of the crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe go hunting for the investor seeker
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the inter-quarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer fixed only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by 0.5 per cent, France's by 0.4 per cent
Both countries have made the data of the second quarter public, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% rather than expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% annually in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the inter-quarter period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to the ČSÚ the trend towards gradual deceleration in the growth of economic development is shaped.
The results are even worse than the forecast of analysts.
Main events:
Every year, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but four-monthly it has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to the previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2 per cent on an annual basis.
The interest of your 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The interest of the Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problem also begins to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of Czech 10-year bonds remain at 4%, although the situation in the area is worsening.
In Germany voices are raised that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
Czechs are classified for Eurocopa.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the classification with a premium of 200 million.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant porter Petr Jiráček, he won by 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second stage, was fantastically defending itself from the attacks of the local team, so that it will not miss the European championship date.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the development of the party in a thorough report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also to the excellent game of Čech and the hero Jiráček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured parties were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who allowed two great occasions to pass.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the appointment of the European Cup, so the national football arches will get a bonus of approximately 200 million crowns.
Since the first few minutes, a good offensive game has been played.
Both teams committed themselves only to maintaining the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, kicks to the other defense field, just what the Czech defense knew to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear installations in Iran.
With his gesture they want to express their support for his country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began to pray on Tuesday at noon in front of the facilities and later chanted slogans of death to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahán human shields around the nuclear technology center where uranium works.
They intend to show that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, noted that Iran, according to all indications, is working hard to obtain nuclear weapons.
In Israel, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students began to pray at noon at the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyse the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be achieved, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan power station, but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner embedded
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and obesity affects 5 per cent.
Obese children mostly come from families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, as can be seen from current research.
The importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference, is again demonstrated.
At the table, obsessive children are fed, for example, of sausages at least twice as often as children of normal weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had eaten chips the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a chance".
In families of overweight children there is no practice of sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and took part in nearly 900 basic education children from across the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a chance", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
To date, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th grade.
An adequate diet and sufficient exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obese children.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five daily meals according to the diet: breakfast, lunch, food, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," reports one of the survey results.
No breakfast but with snack for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, the details, which also count, are also important, such as having a fixed time for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of school families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of households nothing is breakfasted.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in the families of obese children, the insanity fries are much more frequently consumed.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink sweet refreshments daily (70%).
As a rule, more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed sport, but among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study enabled the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets based on all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal."
Among their favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets.
"It is above all alarming the popularity of sweet refreshments", is reported in the final report of the study.
As main food you take the pasta palm and follow closely the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject legume and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changing to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of the study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program "Obesity is not a chance", there was in many cases a major change in favor of the principles of a healthy diet," points out in the results of the study.
Attention is drawn, for example, to sweet refreshments, where many children would start to prefer normal and running water.
Children would also choose more frequently in the questionnaire poultry meat and fish for the main meal and would restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals argue
In the introductory article, How stylists Learn, I complained a little bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three industry professionals, how to dress up problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We have once studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the great majority.
Someone is leathery, someone has a stylized figure without the proper curves and someone suffers overweight.
The stylist must be able to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We've been given some tricks on how to highlight the body of women like Jennifer López, with huge breasts and hips but tight waist and at the same time not dress it in a way too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants are not adapted, it is worth sewing at least one piece of extra fabric to measure.
They will certainly not regret it, because the clothes you feel perfectly are impracticable.
With a tailored skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to dress clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or drapes.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I'm glad I have all week to put all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the task assigned, I have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous ones, to which two costumes must be designed: one for the day and the other for the night.
Consideration should be given to the current aspect, the style of fashion that suits the person in question.
I've been "dressing" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Crying inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently fattened a hundred kilos (please take into account exaggeration), or the young Selena Gómez.
The dresses have to cut them out of the magazines or search them on the internet and print them, then elaborate them graphically.
The moodboard, which is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and relationship to graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, did not see only physically, but also dealt, for example, with the product pages in the magazines (specific topics such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The designer and designer Mario Kameník told us about all this.
But all this is left for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global view.
The three guest specialists encouraged the Saturday conference with information about all kinds of bodies.
Honza Pokorný stylist, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in various ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed classic with jeans and t-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heel shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or it's enough to pull it up and up your neck to get a completely different picture.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you must first know all the rules."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
Finally, it is clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes on the reserve than he intends to photograph.
Thus, for a fashion story that has ten pages (so, ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style alone suppose, in many cases, half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetine have made her a world star.
In Chechnya, for the time being, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even famous characters also find it useless (I just have my skills, my physical appearance doesn't matter that much).
And when someone asks us for our services, we have to bear in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate a size very different from their actual (less) size.
Then it's only left to guggle and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, whether a certain celebrity has fattened/adjacented, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to focus on fashion, but he has to understand outfit.
During your work, especially you should communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't miss it, he defends his opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify her wardrobe and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can't take and throw away everything and say, "hey, what a horror."
"Find at least a couple of things you can ponder and recommend so someone can put them on," says Mario.
He also showed us that everything should fit into the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the waist and you have all the necessary tools there.
They are objects such as scissors, scissors, chitapeluses, or unmissable. There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special clamps for hooking of garments ahead, if it is larger (the pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing game.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the sole of shoes.
Even during photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole could be damaged and much more the exterior could be damaged.
And all we did was put on and on.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so we wouldn't hurt them by accident.
So you had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy in commending my work without reservation.
The truth is, I don't really get those skills.
This is just a small part of all we've heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that devoting myself to stylism at a professional level is not a pink road, but it gives me exactly the same as people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Review
A journey, in principle carefree, is complicated by a series of improper neglects of a routine trip during tomorrow's shift.
To some extent it was possible to meet expectations, but this is of no use, if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new delivery, to which the title is added The Run, raised high expectations already before its premiere.
He promised that he would give new air to the old race saga Need for Speed and, as a result of what has been shown, appears as a game that should not end up being a genre of action without more.
We are also curious to know how the inserted scenes would stay, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As is often the case in the NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be given for acceptable, but in total computation points are lost due to absurd failures, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In fact, errors cannot be called, but rather, they are the incomprehensible disdain of programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit at the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasant in sight, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
So it's nothing from the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
Instead, in the mountains you have to be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each race is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, try to advance a number of required rivals (the normal in a classic race), then try to gain time (chronometered classic duel) and then expect a duel against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this sometimes the police appear, which does nothing but make things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than could be expected (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the footprints of the previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big deal, but it can't be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look somewhere else.
But a career designed with a lot of action is worth this style of driving, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, everything's in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer true of collisions.
From games of this type it is not expected to recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you cannot predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that, by making a very tight advance or circulating the car with a normal traffic, there are only slight rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrollable pirouettes.
Or even ends up totally destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
Resets are programmed in such a way that when you suffer an accident or leave the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race there are only five repairs available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's nothing more than a help in case something goes wrong, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes, even reset helps, it only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, one must enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, although you are the first, fifth or you arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes it especially rabies in situations, when you see that two cars that go to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or stop.
It's the same when you arrive, because it's programmed because the "surprise" will always happen in front of your noses.
Adversaries also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will arrive at places where, without taking into account the moment, you will always advance the same opponent in the same place.
Also this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars that come from the front, so at first you can make the car taste bud.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you right away.
And it's a shame, because even if the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and action, so it's often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn't matter, if merit is taken the idea with fifty exclusive clues or classification in the race so that it doesn't break boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during racing.
You have to be alert to the gas pickers next to the road, because right there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will need what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for straight highways and exotic supersports for technical driving, for example, by mountain roads with curves.
Also the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know about the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
When reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending up with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an Autolog function is connected online, comparing your results with those of other players and providing other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race is made in history.
With the car you reach the tunnel of the metro (pass), where you run dark through the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and suddenly from behind you comes the subway convoy and takes you straight ahead.
In the writing we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one even thought a bit or whether the real authors take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most of the pleasant cases, sometimes even superb ones.
It is a pity that, in the most tense moments, image quality is reduced and sometimes in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of their father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game only for their music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game were to avoid absolutely silly mistakes, we would have problems claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not over.
The fun is assured, but prepare yourself because the mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the strength of airport reflectors.
The choirs of Carolina University will participate in the concert "Students of Terciopelo".

The EU Ambassador, Vice-Nová:
Czechs have a reputation for negativity and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I wasn't expecting a war without a barracks."
"It will take five, six years, before the situation gets a little stable, calm and the new players get used to their new roles," Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, began her conference in the Faculty of Law with conviction.
How to not take seriously his motto "clearly and openly about Europe", which he already said at the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each body of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many speakers of the Faculty of Law of the U. Carolina.
Vicenová also laid down the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first is criticism, that if it is insulting, a gray officer, capable of assuming any role, but I must say that he left everyone disconcerted, because he assumes his roles to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to members of the 27 states, communicate with them and has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new position of representative of Foreign Policy and Security is explained on the basis of the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union vis-à-vis states such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban Olomouc's cheese.
Vice-Nová has also taken care of the agenda as it continues, continues and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good stir", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the budget for seven years of the EU, caused by the current economic situation, must be approved, much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and what less? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe clearly".
"The truth is, I don't like the ugly abbreviations, the alienisms or the jargas that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that cucumbers are not really invented in Brussels by curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban us from Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to make more use of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive ones.
It also regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
It is the fault of many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes to me, a Frenchman next to me says to me, "What have you left, those of the Visegrad Group?", and you can see that he doesn't give her any grace."
In the future, the EU, according to Vice-Nová, is awaiting new, very tough budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, than the new one of the "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that only countries that want to cooperate and those that don't, that stay out."
"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen the Europe of both speeds," says Vice-Nová.
In this regard, he also stressed the role of Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole EU should be discussed among the Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone sought a term that defined IBM's strategy with great precision, the closest would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, has already passed a hundred years since its foundation.
The basis of this long-term character was placed by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his stamp, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised corporate culture.
"For us, IBM implies a long-term thought, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century," said Samuel J. Palmisano, current director of the company.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the businessman of Ba·a in Czechia (IBM employees were the first American operators to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps IBM in the relationship with the customer.
Already from the beginning the company was able to discover talents (as one of the world's first companies to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM's current plan, whereby Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She's been working for thirty years at IBM, where she's been head of sales, marquetine and strategies.
Over the past few years, IBM has participated in so-called virtual encounters, a rain of online ideas, from which countless future strategies and innovations emerge.
It is no surprise that ideas arise, as almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technological enterprise," says Harvard Business School professor economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users," said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies in the last hundred years.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It has the highest number of patents from all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among its inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, bar codes and floppy disks.
IBM will bill this year 220 billion dollars. This year has become the second technology firm for market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations just satisfy the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or PCjr IBM computers).
"If your business is based on moving forward, it cannot become emotionally anchored in the past," acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they don't work, abandon them).
And that's the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically stays and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In the case of sales, IBM is mainly engaged in services, of which approximately one fifth are of programs and one fifth of equipment.
However, even in 1990 the teams accounted for more than half of the supplier ' s share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-performing assets worth $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when for the first time the modern global financial crisis was manifested.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that so far IBM has been able to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM's shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically up to 120%, the net profit of the company has not stopped increasing.
IBM's currency is to change everything, except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
History of IBM: from cheese cutter to space flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted already in 1924 - originally it was a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis that gave rise to the birth of IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
It had inventions such as the famous "file clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired his supervisory board until 1930.
Flint appointed the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to assist him with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed IBM's founder ( Watson's ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business equipment, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, the billing doubled by $9 million and began the great expansion of the company by the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost forty years after occupying the chief's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous Moon flight).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fishes", which established the computer standard of that time, arrived at the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering a complete advice and services of high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid for these last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet".
Its objective is to make the use of technology more rational, although the areas have not yet been planned and the circumstances, for example, with regard to transport and city administration, have not improved.
For the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the Smart Commerce platform that allows retailers to manage the full business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia at the time, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-famous research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina continued to hope that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but no longer as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová welcomed Bartošové into her home during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after İíčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even left him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him away."
"But here I would live not as my dear old drunkard who was wrong, but as a man to whom certain bonds bind me," Rychtářová said and added that he had already unhindered his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef so far doesn't care if he's a woman who's locked the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change."
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company remains in force, I make the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I make the shopping."
"Darina and I talked to each other normally, the only thing is that we don't share bed," Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not oppose it.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't interest me, or where she goes or if she has any boyfriends.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and assumed all responsibility," Josef concludes.
The worst vices of women: do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to quote some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize them on the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that can boil the blood of men?
Shopping
Do you blame your half-orange who's dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one rag every week?
Do you like to buy often at the discounts?
Then in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk simply through the clothes shops, look for well adjusted clothes and then try them all in the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner to wait for her in front of the door.
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I'd need to slim down at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't you hear these phrases?
What do you mean?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It's not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing your partner complain all the time about your physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning in the first place
He's like an infinite tiovivo.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, scrub the floor, remove the dust, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for treading the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for dirtying a newly cleaned washbasin and a shelf with glass doors that cost you so much to clean?
In case you suffer from this "difference", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleaning should surely not be of paramount importance to the family.
This harmless desire to clean up could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make nasty comments
"The used underpants are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too"
"The wet rag is not left on the ground!"
If you make those cometaries to your partner more often a day, know that this will get you out of your boxes.
Of course. You don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Calumnies and gossip
Some women also have slanders, gossips, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk to each other about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us sometimes gets away with a little harmless gossip.
With your hand in your heart, this is true of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossiping women who don't control themselves, who love to gossip and often do so, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a women's work team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assistance to defeat Philadelphia
Hockey leader Jaromír Jágr participated on Monday in the NHL match with two assists that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and rejoined Czech players at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's play, and took one more step and was declared the best player of the game.
Two assists were awarded in the party and also Jágr's partner, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr stated to the overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"I told him before the game I'd triplet."
"I'd present it."
"Sometimes they look ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers' first plot.
A while later the team's second intervention also had a Czech trail.
Voráček made the album behind the Hurricanes' doorway and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but since the beginning of the second part already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr, he scored the third goal, after his shot collapsed through Wayne Simmonds' door room.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player on the field, but he's definitely among the top three," Jágr said to his power station.
"It would never have occurred to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I'm very satisfied with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my companions played for me, and that now produces results," adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again of Dwyer, of penaltyti, until he got to a goal of distance.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up outnumbered in two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He emptied the disk, I took speed and Read went to the furthest part."
"I tried to tie him to the record and I'm happy because I got it," Voráček described the last goal of the game as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has placed itself at the head of the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired for an injury at the top of the body.
Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also for a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and playing the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest were novels."
"Finally, but it's that nothing can be done against it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the record out of our field."
"And so we left gaps," explained one of the defenses, P.K. Subban.
The porter Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over the Tampa Bay.
Jets' goals were scored by five players who thus ended a series of defeats that already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time were selling in most cases trips only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime bowed westward and the travel of Czech tourists was then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually not even by socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West at that time, but one had to put on the line with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Still not everything was won.
The so-called "change promise" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs bought. This custom still persists.
The Czechs' way of travelling has suffered a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries all over the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, that Croatia was not able to travel freely until 1989 because it was part of the Yugoslavia of that time.
In the early 1990s, visa exemptions were imposed to travel to neighbouring Western European States, resulting in a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see enough of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see him for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech groups slept in the parks in tents, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was to take the food (conservatives, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living increased and with it also average wages, which around 1997 led to an increase in travel demand.
With the increase in travel demand the agencies began, from 1997 on a regular basis, to prepare travel using charter flights connections, which led to incredible lower travel prices compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 90th century, the Czechs were travelling without a visa to almost all developed countries, except the United States, which further simplified our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Chechnya to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists have been flying to distant and hot countries every year. This winter will already fly directly from Czech to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting nearly 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. removed visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent more than 15,000 Czech kroner per head travelling abroad, including expenses on the residence site.
Convened Ordinary General Assembly to elect the president, who could end up dead again.
For almost five months now, Czech football has been without president and it is likely that Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, agreement has not yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you will not be able to vote even to choose between the three candidates.
Those interested in chairing Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June not without first summoning his colleagues in order to find a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the end of the Hašek era, a dispute arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was highlighted on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dåm), located in the Pragán district of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only as regards the method of election.
There was no consensus or who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or delegates with full powers.
From that point on, and because of this single point, there was a partial agreement, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which full-fledged representation is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
Further light on the situation was no longer available to the Executive Committee, which, at its regular or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the neural point remains the same.
The question is: how should we proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of FAČR, who, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his candidacy will win.
The Moravia Region is willing to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemia part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have a majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, remove the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system", is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With that, surprisingly, Tomaš Paclík also agrees, although it is assumed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are more suitable for Pelta.
"I would like you to vote to the maximum according to the statutes."
"So that no nonsense is invented about representatives as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who first applied as a candidate and directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta's still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be appeased with today's party of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will again be a protagonist, and so will be more comfortable to cooperate," says the Jablonice representative, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"It's not about the conflict between bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"However, I hope that common sense will be imposed," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the game starts if the football team is complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning for technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one to be held at ministerial level, which, as they say, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to include the divided parties in the country's most powerful sports organization in order to reach an agreement.
There is much at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) will try to provide a new direction to Czech sport following the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen footballers, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of an appropriate candidate who satisfied all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not stand as a candidate for such a relevant position.
"If there was a suitable person, I'd be fighting for her and not running for election."
"But to this day you have not been able to find a person like this," Paclík said for the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, who opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that if he wins, he will remain in office as president only until 2013, when the ordinary general assembly comes.
In that position you would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too much related to football events.
"I've already talked to some people I could consider."
"For me it was crazy to hear some say that right now they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," he adds.
What supposedly bothers Paclík most right now is Pelta's relationship with the President of the Pilsen Roman Berbr Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting on the presidential chair.
"If he won, he would keep the status in force and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will benefit even less," Paclík said.
It also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a phone call during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes the UEFA and FIFA will look at us," Paclík said, who also takes with some caution his previous statement that "would sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta becomes president."
In the event of winning Thursday's election, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
The other candidate, Rajchl, is of the same opinion, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine, for example, as head of representation."
"but not as an association manager."
"I also don't put my nose where I don't feel capable," said Paclík, who in September attracted much attention to supporting the suspension of the Arbitrators Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, then replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare manage the association.
It uses its management capabilities of private companies, since last summer it is also the Director of Pilsen, who with his support celebrated the victory in first division in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the football field and contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some lobbyists, who probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathy towards the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders to devote more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key problems the new president should be dedicated to."
"If they increase taxes on gambling, as announced by the political parties, it would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to stop," he says.
Besides, Paclík now does not even consider his association with Club Pilsner, although he himself claims that the President of FAČR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla from Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in hypocritically yielding my actions from the Pilsen Club to another person and then going back there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised FAČR new statutes that would end the impasse in the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, it would ensure that FAČR had new statutes that would serve definitively to resolve, in the future, disputes over electoral rules.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about this Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Prior to the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fund-raising.
He decided to participate in the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could go well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
"People at all levels have been working on football for a long time and hope to meet the new President this Thursday."
"They feel that the time has come for someone to run the association," the man who is mainly associated with the Club de Jablonice thinks, but who worked in Sparta and the Association's executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that prevailed in Ivan Hašek's time.
"Unfortunately, the June General Assembly adopted the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a lure to win the delegates.
"If I'm elected president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to answer in case this fails."
"It's a matter of principles, without which we can't exist," Pelta says.
Also, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
In the past he had already warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, whom he respected for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It's been a long time now without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, didn't leave puppetry with a head.
"It's been more than a year in the football world, and it's already achieved some successes."
"His attacks but were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the superiors.
The latter should be a football promotion showcase.
"I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately then be involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of the football team would not entail any personal changes to the staff.
"I would have to know each employee's tasks first," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, there is a comprehensible nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are vaunting before the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will recover only if it finally has a leader," still two days before the most decisive day in his career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FAČR would start working eagerly.
If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl was elected as the new President of the Czech Football Association in the Fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that if elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each football area individually.
He is also committed to solving the Bohemians' case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I would like to devote myself entirely to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, through professional football or training of high-performance young footballers."
"With this I don't mean that I would do everything alone," Rajchl said in an interview for the ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee in such a way that each member can devote himself to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with much momentum."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not presenting again as a candidate.
"Everybody knows, I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every step," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"Many people have told me that I should not give up, because then they would give up too."
"It's about having faith not to give up like this," he said.
According to them, it also motivates him to continue the work he has already begun with Hašek.
"During those two years, a large part of the work that I don't want to lose now has been completed."
"There are processes that had begun and that will have their effect within a couple of years and I wouldn't want anyone to stop them," he said concerned that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be as it was before Hašek's time.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it would be only a privilege for a few chosen."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favor of someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because that's the only way everyone will feel good and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind to do the utmost for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech part and another Moravian, whose winners would go to the first division."
"We wouldn't have the current situation where we have only three Moravia teams, which is a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the presidential elections, Rajchl continues to believe in his chances of being elected.
"I am still sorry to have strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and knows that behind me there are clear successes," Rajchl said, whose successes include saving tens of millions of crowns of disadvantageous contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, it acknowledges its share of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football", consider the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing of the committees."
"I don't want to use that in my favor," he evaluates his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Pools from an incredible optic, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Whoever visits Europe can live its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest his tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something he couldn't miss in his luggage, a swimmer.
Lying on the back of the water, he looked at the artistic dome at the top, swam towards the marble angels, who waited for it at the edge of the pool and marvelled at the modernist indoor pool meticulously restored.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "buildings of concrete" in Taunus.
He made his "travel through the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of bathroom culture.
He wants nothing to do with sport, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers you that fans in the bathroom have to settle with blue tiles and chlorine stench, while fans to run can breathe the fascinating smell of fir forests or listen to the joyous bird trins in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools have to always be so ugly," says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The spa in the pool and the ethereal sauna oils. The well-being factor in the pools is so great because they care for all the senses, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, the indoor pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of flooring, the bathrooms have a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything folds optically: high vaults, colored tiles, trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data about architecture and the history of art in the historic oasis of well-being, but, mainly, it wants to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding copies of her research in Hungary.
Alongside the magnificent medical baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, there are nitrated waters in a unique karstic cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as hot springs, whose pools are of alkaline waters and are located in a building with bottle-shaped shape (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city puts its eyes on the rooftop swimming pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bathroom in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: Ötztal Water Cathedral looks like an UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs steam in winter, while from the bottom the Ötztal mountains rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all pools.
Many thermal baths smell like sulfur, in Árpád's baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, gas oil plague is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose ligame is attached to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for beautiful places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit discovered pools and sunbathings in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, he found a blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the weed grow among the tiles.
The decadence contrasted in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction after themselves; not only can neo-Romanic elements of the time of their construction be discovered in 1844, but also an Arab hall of Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its impressive modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural from the Black Forest.
"It has great merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," Meder says.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently doesn't matter much.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses raw materials business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For the citizens, it is clear, according to a study, that 84 percent of Germans do not think it acceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifys the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that global commodity stock exchanges raise prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer campaign is aimed specifically at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, bets on raw materials were thought to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that players have unbundled from offers and demands, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticisms differently than American competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "should compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the demands of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank directive, together with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank's management will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Bets at rising food prices show particularly drastic how ruthless banks currently harm public welfare."
Ackermann is the largest bank lobby, especially in the bonds.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio that put money at stake for food-price bets," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of hungry people or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from what was not planned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation it can perfect its image.
And you need to barely care for any losses, that's what your successor will take care of.
Two thirds would cancel the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were bet.
Many bank clients showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such business: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes from agricultural speculation.
43 percent would disadvise such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflection, to cancel their account and change to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The flag transferred
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian universal exhibition in Brussels won prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, was empty and collapsed.
Now he's reopening as an exhibition house.
The architecture of modern postgerra passions, the clear forms, the glass halls, the brave curves and the new construction materials, typical of the thought about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels of 1958 is an appropriate and known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix de Arquitectura for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
The construction is to date considered a contemporary milestone of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austria pavilion in the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was erected after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to the station of the south of Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and inside was inaugurated a 20th century museum, it was called the "house 20".
The building was suitable but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is falling more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now called it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a coup de luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, an ice skater in her youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founder director of the modern art museum in Salzburg, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and also a building of offices.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because he reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, extended it and was awarded the contest, but also because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are great problems, the building was "an energy eater," Krischanitz said.
The window profile of the glass facade was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced with a special safety crystal.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and the asbestos ceilings were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel descended between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in old mahogany tones and protected from oxidation.
And the movie theater is exactly the way it used to be.
And all this with strict control on the part of the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and warns of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The "Brussels" pavilion has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "accident in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that is why it wanted "to awaken the proper consciousness".
In this case house 21 is not in the wrong place, a hit of urban luck has happened. The totally new and planned "barrio of the central station", with homes and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck happens: House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as we hear, negotiate with the city about a neighbouring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a package of winter crises that amounts to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid the breakdowns of trains in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against the breakdowns and delays of the trains caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than €70 million this year, according to a journalistic report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the planned investments until 2005 of a total of about 300 million euros.
For what should be achieved a better availability of vehicles and the railway network even in an extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from the tracks and the Andeans.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of breakdowns and delays on trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, he was short of reservations in the event of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting years for authorization from the federal railway office.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the break of an axle at the central station of Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the U.S.
After the tumult of President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem appears, the Deutsche Bank must pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (€106 million) in an agreement, to put an end to the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgages.
The NCUA financial market regulator recriminates many large banks inducing credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to the courts," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank admits no guilt with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which made a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, President of NCUA, welcomed the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US credit cooperatives and provides support in the event of bankruptcy to protect client investments.
The NCUA is trying to reintegrate the losses of millions.
The agreements currently concluded are its first type.
The regulator had also ordered accounts from other large banks and in summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, they are the so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, it is currently blowing a complicated wind for American banks.
Investors and inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or sanction faults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the highest number of demands.
It reminds the 18 major international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has a demand from the FHFA, it is business worth 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires that the Frankfurt Institute respond to "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, invests forcefully in the IT company IBM.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technologies as the forecasts of the long-term development of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM's trade report and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
He had to understand long before IBM mainly offered services and sought computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive Information Technologies must be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett was currently unveiled at the CNBC Economics Station, which has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment Berkshire Hathaway has thus ascended to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the engagement so far.
He commended the leadership that dealt with the regular benefits of the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has for some time established profit information technology services such as the operation of calculation centres.
The old computer pioneer of over 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett avoided technology companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of major consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81 years old, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense to earn money has provided him the nickname of "Omaha Oracle".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM stock in stock rose by one percent.
"The Blue Giant", as IBM is known, has a stock value of more than $220 billion and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world's most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is an intimate friend.
The threat is real
After the discovery of "the Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that revives itself again.
The murders of eight small trick and Greek businessmen between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right.
Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost who had long been believed to have died has returned, since the attacks in the form of fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of violence with an extreme right-wing background against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned whether there is xenophobia in Germany.
The undiscovered ultra-righteous network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology revived again?" headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office of Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-righteous pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a watch at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with the German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act of the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with joyful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information reached some Turkish media as a slap: "The German gift for the 50th anniversary", says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
Nor does the German broadcast "Hürriyet" insist on tracing this mental connection.
"Start smelling bad," says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He points out that the murdered were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution to his work in rebuilding Germany.
In the German internet forums of Turkish origin, police behaviour and their subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not long sought suspects in the ultra-right circle.
Some people show the less rhetorical about the drastic means: "From now on, immigrants are lost, they only have self-defense and weapons."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the whole network," writes Selen.
This means that if Germany's internal peace is in jeopardy, the Mölln and Solingen attacks will be clarified in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a specific threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks exacerbate the feeling of group on the Turkish side.
Don't repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press then criticized mainly the weakness of German politics following the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After Solingen's fire-form attack, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his Foreign Minister, replaced him at the Cologne funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks of Germany contributed with taxes.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his or her taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media once again shows how profound, since then, the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a reassessment of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The seat of the lake scandal of Zurich
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then it has slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now a German runs it.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought about it.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it was known that in 2013 he would begin in a new and almost equally spectacular work: Chairman of the administrative board of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoices, praises Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired solidity and lets friendly remarks fall on its future companions.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I am happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the bank's security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, Managing Director of USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the board of directors of the USB has since been considered equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber will have to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the Administrative Council in May, not in early 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and advisor and has had a period of adaptation surely necessary.
He suddenly became responsible for the strategy of a bank, which had just proved to be worthy of the title "the biggest bank of Europe's scandal" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset administrator, and on the other, for years, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, saves the old-time so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset manager, but also handy, combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 billion, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the big banks of the world.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later banker teacher in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, general manager, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To load with this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course that some looked with contempt until just before: an Asian and opaque state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, president of the administrative council, in 2006 on the second best paid administrative council of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank purchased problematic values from the UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bonus, by which it became a co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic this was for a small country, if it houses such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than Switzerland's economic performance (see graph).
"We can't rescue UBS again," said Geiger, banker expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to deliver the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, the UBS confessed more or less to having helped in tax fraud.
At the same time, he lost something that had always been his capital in competition for wealthy customers: the aureola of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of client funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in investment banking through misconceptions and in the administration of goods through aid for tax fraud.
And just when it was a little bit quieter again, just when it was thought that the UBS was getting it again, this unfortunate operator's story happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was wrong.
And it turned out, apparently, this still doesn't work well with risk management in the investment bank.
"With the Adoboli case, it is apparent that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls".
So the idea of caution arose, with which Swiss bankers had long presented themselves, to be the guardians of the greatest assets in the world: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The Swiss banks' security deposits were a symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS central in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of the Swiss solid private bank, it is just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Bahnhofstraße street in Zurich, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here are jewelry like Tiffany`s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have lived here for years: from the national bank, passing through the Palace of Credit Suisse, to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the UBS reception room through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, front are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bank there is a great sign to indicate "security".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point have shifted the idea of the large Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both large banks.
The UBS has become too big, he believes, mainly in the investment bank, where Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they have long become accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the great Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The crash of the UBS" in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do you think?
You talk to the Swiss bankers, so you see the problem in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges which, due to the merger, was too big for little Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to make the two different pioneer banks of the UBS complementary: a rich but sleeping bank with the center of property administration in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could make a big financial bike run.
There are two names related to this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the consortium of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the administrative council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says banker Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive one that managed to open up from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel got away from Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: Destiny came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the management meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Lowering the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They led the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps went well.
In foreign exchange transactions and stock trading it was at the highest.
However, the consultants of the companies in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the banking language "fixed income", there is a huge compensation for the big banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Avid of growth, they invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine to hold American mortgages and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks, he looked for the descent for a long time.
"In summer 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, banker expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order became more complicated than they expected.
The UBS positions have become projectable seats and are insecure to date.
At present, who runs a large bank, has almost impossible work.
You must find a strategy for a bank, to which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, bank expert, has an idea, put an end to the investment bank, concentrate on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far (yet).
But the investment bank must go down a lot, it is now clear.
On Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the bank's new president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, since the bank was surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed: He must permanently run UBS business, communicated the bank of Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to his state in the mid-nineties.
Remove 3,500 posts.
But this isn't enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money for?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask right now.
So far, he's just saying he's looking for a house with his wife in Zurich first.
Next year.

Europe cannot be freed so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, just confirmed this precaution, is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to put an end to the crisis, he said in an interview with the CNBC.

Smart hedges spread in cities
In many places the pigs are considered "problematic birds": these very intelligent animals are not expelled from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the geese belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors are piled up because of the filth and noise of the animals.
Although no means has appeared against the "problematic birds" so far.
The beans no longer leave the cities, the experts say at the first symposium on beans in Leer, Eastern Frisia.
There, specialists from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected grains from the countryside; chemical applications in agriculture clearly end with traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, growing construction and falling trees that host them make it difficult for birds to live.
The beans are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westfalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to mass-kill the district's geese jumped the negative press headlines.
Critics have called hunting animals by trapping birds and killing sticks as especially brutal.
"By expelling them and fleeing them normally nothing is achieved," said Werner Klöver, an urbanist and landscaper from Leer.
Shooting the nests with water or throwing trees are often unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert at Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals deviate, large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
To drive them away is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, old-age homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
A combination of fleeing animals from sensitive residential areas and baits is possible to resettle in other places.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against in order to treat animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a peak in the face with aplom."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on Ascheberger's beans, where signs inform about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticisms of the noise of birds: "All are forms of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the geese not only take advantage of the resources to access weird bites, but also make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists from Cambridge University checked in four geese as far as bird intelligence comes.
In an experiment, birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a larva of moth.
Without much training, they recognized with determination the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the smart guys had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a larva of moth in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get to their prey with the beak.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the tube shooter.
Three of the four guys got it in the first attempt.
Portugal at the Eurocopa 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favorites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in Eurocopa 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the latest Euro Cup 2012 tickets in Poland and Ukraine.

In the stadium da Luz de Lisboa, Portugal began perfectly.
Ronaldo executed a free direct from more than 30 meters to put his head at the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his skills to score from afar and got 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, which did not appear in the first half hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to the goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former player of the Wolfsburg team, leader of the English Manchester City sent a head to the pole, but the ball did not cross the gateline (33).
Jiracek was right for the Czech Republic
Then the collegiate Wolfgang Stark, from Ergolding, was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the area of Bosnian pram, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself on the ground (36).
On the opposite side, Stark filed a controversial penalty following an action by Fabio Conentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt in the 81st minute with Petr Jiracek's goal.
The 1976 European champion is ranked fifth consecutively for the Euro Cup.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the legionnaire of the Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, the goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal in his own door of Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had more possibilities with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the frontal turn, very right in Cech's doorway.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the flag of the world-famous porter, the front of the CF Seoul again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the game.
In the meantime, Turkey has missed the wonder of Zagreb's football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that the national coach Guus Hiddink was to leave his seat in the 2002 world's third-party bench, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation at the end of the Eurocopa.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream principle.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only got to touch the pole. Attacker Kazim Kazim also couldn't send the ball inside the door.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia did not let any goals put on it.
Along with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who made room in minute 62 Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattini goes to Eurocopa

Stephen Ward took coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, which won with the 4-0 in the go match prepared for a previous decision, he put himself at the head in minute 32.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied up with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the beginning, but it had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had her first great chance.
From the very first moment, the Estonian defense avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in minute 32. He pushed him forward.
After a defense of the goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, achieving 1-0.

Personal massacre
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Pain of the Battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about World War I, "starts with a long dramatism personae of the kind that can cause one to fall the soul to the feet.
Here are some action tips: Gently start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
You will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novelistic narrative, and this dramatis personae will work as your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of your men and women, you are confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What you have written here is a rare book, which rightly describes as "an anti-history work."
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are practically no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, it explains, as "a book about how it happened." It deals with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and pain of the battle" combines the experiences in times of war of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from high schools and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go crazy or die.
Their lives flash here as votive candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mixture while others are turned off.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also a remedial to the notion that World War I was only the disastrous trench war on the western front.
"The beauty and pain of the battle" moves expertly through other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall over the hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
War floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that stinks of rope.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
"Factlessness," notes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and pain of battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
Their stories have mostly been obtained from memoirs, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and fixing them with what there is.
About telling the story of a German high schoolgirl says, "Successions, everywhere successors."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation gum, paper sales, wooden buttons."
He keeps talking about the next meal in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed into sheep's fat (and stuffed with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, he notes, "837 permitted meat substitutes in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards salvjism and manifests about the war: "You feel that, after all, this is for what men are conceived and not to sit on chairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that bruised and stuffed sin."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
"Once you're reluctant to think about sacrificing yourself, you'd like to think it might happen in front of the public," he writes.
On the other hand, it's horribly similar to "a convicted man being strangled in secret."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the beastly of the young century: The eloquent mass murderer and ideologically convinced with clothing of good clothing that executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unexpected ways; there are both innoble and heroic behaviors.
Mr. Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to evade service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the trade of pus gonococcal, which soldiers buy and bag their genitals with it in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it on their eyes, which often gives rise to a blindness for life."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war to "unsettled exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels like Novelty on the front of Erich Maria Note, instead of integral stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a work of nonfiction.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he had come from his book, pulled out of your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and burned it with a wax.
After a false previous step, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing anti-disturbing helmets.
It was chosen Monday night to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence emphasized how the operation was plagued by challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, could not be repeated, violating the department's standards and creating a storm of public sympathy for the "okupas".
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
Agents had been prepared to see how occupations had developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking towards Zuccotti.
Officers increased the so-called disorder training - counter-terrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park came in the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
"To the few cops I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels in the department."
A reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, some agents wanted to clear the park, but they quit when hundreds of protesters came up early after hearing about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved agents from several police units, including special forces across the city district - dozens of mobile agents who used to flood neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making the 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do so when there were the least number of people in the park," he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with spotlights and speakers gathered at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages that receded from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windfalls, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No tent was played until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving the protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering in the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they tried to prevent the police from taking action in the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense tide of personal effects of protesters, including luggage and bags of paper and plastic garbage packed with clothes, cleaning department teams followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, appearing on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter were locked between them by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency service agents were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said that some 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "altering public order and resisting authority," he said.
The highest-ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the senior officer uniformed in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of detectives in the department, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, "he wasn't running the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Streets and Cedar, in case they had to enter.
They were barricaded on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From these positions, the police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a series of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the north perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestant jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking the air off the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protestant were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will sue the city for redundancies
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The demand is, possibly, the last weapon available to the union, in municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke dismissals.
Seventy-six hundred and two school assistants, the parents' coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on 7 October, in a movement that trade union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, access by the city to a health care fund in charge of working groups to close their budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
In a hearing at the City Hall last month, the Education Advisor, Dennis M. Walcott, said that layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council counterattacked him saying that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be fired.
Municipal District officials 37 said they filed the claim in writing, warning the Department of Education that he would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official presentation of the claim, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department as defendants, with eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the City's Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies in the city's poor-area schools to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, as they had been undersubsidized chronically.
It is noted that although there were no layoffs in Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. District budget 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each enrolment per poor student in schools.
The union also states that the directors of secondary schools may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "excessive" to describe the action, although "excessive" more often describes the act of moving a teacher of the payroll from a school to a work bag, whose wages are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parents' coordinators were fired," says the draft complaint, "and not just in surplus."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muamar the Gaddafi to be captured and killed and for the participation of the United States to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democratic for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent of Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and US troops for their "valenty".
"This resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya by beginning to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It's a bipartisan support statement for your democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties fought with each other and the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, which never came to vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut the funds for US operations in Libya.
That left the US mission in a sort of legislative purgatory - with Congress annoying enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not as angry as to actually dry the grass under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
NATO's mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee's resolution "happs the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "happs the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide the legislators as the June bill did?
The last version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indian), the committee's main Republican.
The local spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not so far succeeded in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte's is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced into this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others with slight variations between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment only in the House, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially new Republicans who seek to refine their curricula - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of this measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that Congress members can carry out, while the representative José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York) wants to remove the limit of two terms for the presidents.
The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democratic for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment prohibiting homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one prohibiting the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that Members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they do now.
The last amendment that was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
Giffords talks in his first TV interview since the shooting.
Ten months after a gunman shot him in a constituent act in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat for Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang with Broadway's melody "The sun will come out tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, passing from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he came back by surprise to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked him how he feels, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "That's enough."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special "20/20" program, which was released on the eve of the publication of the new couple's book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special program analyzed Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with shaved head and a long scar crossing her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up while her husband cheers her up.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head move.
A frowning of the lips.
And then his first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "all", a request for change on his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: The congresswoman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who's been on therapy for two hours every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said she was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the 12 March murder when she arrested him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Dough, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, "'Gabby, you haven't been defeated," Kelly said.
"You've just been hit.
And you're gonna get out of this, and you're gonna recover and you're gonna come back stronger than ever."
Troops make people feel more sorry than respect.
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration, and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines broke into their posts around him.
The multitude of labels stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer in the gala, also known as the then President of the Joint Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They showed them as some sort of orphaned child," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The strikingly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has seized the military and a often distant American public, sometimes worshipping.
The troops are given praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, say the members of the service.
The public is increasingly acting like they're hurting the uniformed ones.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some people show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or in disagreement with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most of the pity talks are held in silence and in private among war veterans.
After his two children returned from fighting with the Navy Infantry, retired Colonel Mark Canzan warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be a "veteran angry and violent under the surface," said Canzan, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had asked him subtly whether he would be able to endure under pressure from a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions," Cancián recalled by telling his children.
The military concern arises, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II," retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan, said.
On the other hand, the praises of politicians and the public are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces growing pressure to end the rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First-rate soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his barracks at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It sounded like an alarm signal," Lyman says.
However, Texas' native left her concern aside.
I thought, no, she's 19.
"He's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, pulling him down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of current and former military personnel eagerly await a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The claim claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, they all claim that they were sexually raped or assaulted by their comrades, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going for the army's main plane, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure from up to down," he says.
"Who are the people who are able to eradicate the culture of reprisals?
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future demands.
Your strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defense, headed by Federal Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - essentially, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for the injuries suffered in the armed forces.
By a judgment of the 1950 Supreme Court called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by active staff.
"The alleged damages are part of the applicant's military service," the documents say.
The Department of Defense refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are underway, in addition to hers.
In Yale Law School, the Legal Services Clinic for Veterans is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a claim against the army that focuses on the diagnoses of "personality disorder" assigned to victims of rape in order to release them from service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a complaint in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the manner in which it handles claims of benefit to persons who claim to have been sexually assaulted in service.
Nine separate bills have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response of the Department of Defense.
However, the assaults are significantly below reported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which amounts to approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases reported in the army went to trial - half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe his attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he was asked to tell details of his rape 11 times different to a multitude of police, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted to a rape kit, and her assailant's blood - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing with a judge, during which he was asked about having had sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons testified as witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psych ward, and when I left, I remember I told my commanding officer, "That wasn't his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed him with personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was dispensed from the service under less-than-honourable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his fellow defendants continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of law at the George Washington Faculty of Law.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is behind decades because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence as the responsibility.
And he adds, "The odds are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not go its way, Burke, counsel for the plaintiffs, will put his other hundreds of plaintiffs in line for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place," he says.
"Or until we die, what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to killing in Norway in July, who left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time preceding his attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - you just have to go on Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't that hard to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report on European digital populism published by the UK DEMOS study centre.
Facebook's personal information list is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific precision - the way sellers have been using it for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then directed ads to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
On arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 far right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing an investigation," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry by immigration.
However, in a kind of turn, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen."
DEMOS's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "I like", messages on the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating an increase in research, boosting the number of academic works with the name of the site in the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to go through the game, and they'd never allow you access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook eliminates all that - you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that university students who spoke about their drinking efforts on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student publish too many state updates with his drunkards.
"You can't deal with a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Children's Health, Behavior and Development Center at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "pinching" its own population for data.
The Site's Data Team has developed statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - defenders of digital freedom long ago argue that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could be looking at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study that carried out with the student's Facebook public walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even out of line, there is no guarantee that a subject of research is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of a user's profile information and wall messages are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and a pen remain the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social still happens offline."
"Fry and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Templar Knights of Norway," he said in front of a room filled with 500 people.
"I oppose the court, as it received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, banned him from access to the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and family members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope of looking Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that he is locked up.
All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," one Utoya survivor told Norwegian NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not mentally ill, and said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may feel that the attacks of 22 July seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," said a family member of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' missing interview, shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius from technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in an interview with recently rediscovered Jobs that has been unspoilt as advance of a series of special projections in the biggest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of flow diagrams - a man who believed many executives were suffering "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds on the dawn of his personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time, it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively on his new NeXT computer company, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transportation.
It was only after the death of Jobs that a full copy of VHS was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly reissued archive material is the basis of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute lost interview that arrives at the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and the answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Job perfectionism comes to the surface, where it seems impatient due to Cringely's questions, pushing him to move faster towards the most important topics or arguments.
Filmed before the Pixar era, iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic about Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
One thing is to read posthumous evaluations of Job career, but there is something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the eager dreamer at the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, it was and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always wondered, "Why do you do things?" and the answers they give you invariably are, "Oh, that's just the way it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs takes to detail their efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Disconcerted by the way in which the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made to the eye of good cover, and then adjusting with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long distance calls for free.
It has been written extensively about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here by describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
It describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world a half dozen times and you were screaming through the public phone and returning a minute later to the public phone at the door next door," says Jobs with a laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
The two of us didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak with the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two burst into carcases just before the very Pope was awakened to go and answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and formed my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desk computer ever made."
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I'd get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste my time with that machine and write programs for her.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the march.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of base plates, he was asked by a client if he could mount all the equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while in Apple, remember the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got bored and I left and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
About big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple's renaissance, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble in his vision, and lose control of his market share.
"Tell me you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopiers and printers, so what?"
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments are increasing success, so it is this kind of people who end up leading companies and product managers are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position is rotted because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows."
Much is learned about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can't make the electrons, glass makes them, robots do them, factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end everything is reduced to taste - it is reduced to trying to expose you to the best that a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things to those things that you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never had any shame about stealing big ideas.
What partly made Macintosh great was that the people who were working on him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with the rivals of the health care law while the court accepts the case
On the day that the Supreme Court met in private to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge of President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were caught up in a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will expose the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to study carefully the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total reform of health care approved by Congress last year, a law that has been a cry of war for conservative activists throughout the country.
The judges agreed to admit the lawsuit to trial and, in fact, a 5-and-a-half-hour historical allegation is expected by March, and the result will likely further disrupt the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and claim that the law must be dismissed will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during George W. Bush's administration.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society dinner, a group that has been dedicated for many years to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another signature that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at dinner?
It is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, it might be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: "A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or appear on the program of such an event. "
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm the ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive gap in ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several judges who abide by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were charged with collecting gala funds with lawyers who have pending cases before the court."
Their appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticisms that say they mix too easily the court's activity with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is the teacher Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented to the court of first instance.
His critics have pressed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law as if she were now impartial.
Kagan hasn't given any indication he's gonna do it.
Boeing receives a record order of $18 billion
Emirates airline requests 50 Boeing 777 double aisle aircraft, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at over $1 billion.
Rarely is it news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the Boeing Co. aircraft manufacturer and the selling price for the 50 aircraft amounts to a record of $18 billion.
It is as large as the place from which Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine growing in future aircraft orders.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend its largest order of history for commercial aircraft worth $ - 50 jets Boeing 777 double corridor.
The successful order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the Dubai Air Show 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which presupposes fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing," said Morningstar Neal Dihora analyst.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so damaging, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil.
That's important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices increase, Dihora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates' request solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide-sealing aircraft market and helps keep track of its Airbus SAS competitor's attempt to invade its domain with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the air fair takes place four months after Airbus said it was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
He delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, apparently defeated in Michoacán's vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the governor's contest.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her candidacy as governor of Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results led to Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI in the western governor's career.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa María Calderón in a radio interview one day after the Sunday vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... seized the polls, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a return, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have outstripped Calderón, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate for the conservative National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the office of governor, was in third place, a great defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the birthplace of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and many candidates abandoned local candidatures for fear.
Although for the PRI, as unpleasant as the election of Michoacán seems, a victory will help drive the party forward.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, ahead of next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare themselves to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said the two fastest growing economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in an "impartial" manner and said that Asia's financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help to avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"So it can be protected to some extent, but it can't be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
European monetary union has been seriously undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's debt costs have skyrocketed and Italy's and Greece's prime ministers have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for the major emerging economies to unite to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from the fall in exports and the depletion of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when facing their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the billions two hundred thousand people in India, of whom up to 800 million live with about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that won't look good," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep the many well-remunerated Greek public sector workers in jobs of poorly run companies and loss-generating companies such as railways.
Mr. Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens "important chain effects" throughout Asia.
The Asian Development Bank's forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing "low risk" due to Europe's threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant outflows of capital from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon about possible defence cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta heated the Congress on Monday, warning that the upcoming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a chain-based financial reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to the Afghanistan battlefields, to the civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but now it fears an additional reduction of $600 billion or more in cuts that can be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "sequestration", would lead to 23 percent global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
"A cut so large, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects impossible to execute - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to remove many of our civil servants involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to leave civilians in order to meet the objective."
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage the willingness."
The cuts over time would reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"While funding for wartime in overseas contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in core budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and the supervision of the contract supporting the war."
"The payroll staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to wartime vendors, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's main military power."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result you can live with, and certainly it is not one that we should impose on ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the interests of the national security of the United States, and it should not be allowed to happen."
If Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts, it is to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about possible cuts, even though she came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budget experience in Congress and the White House and knowing she was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Secretary painted a gloomy picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening words at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morals, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries."
"Indeed, he invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how reductions "generate important operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and engaged previously around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter combat aircraft, a planned new bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping F35's further development and testing could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each party accuses of lying to the other.
Administrators at Pennsylvania State University have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolás Sarkozy was "painted" with an open microphone saying to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
Congressman for New York and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made a mockery of his denials quickly overshadowed by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with violations of campaign funding related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps in school and university exams are widespread.
There have been cases in which teachers have given the exam responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that the unknown lied three times in the first 10 minutes of knowing each other.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the past six decades at prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about lying have been refuted.
The liars do look into the eyes.
They don't always trembling, babbling, roaring, or restless.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, the microfacial expressions, the formation of questions and the times.
I spent several years researching scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or negotiating management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "minors oriented towards themselves", while women say more lies "oriented towards others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- than married people lie less frequently to their couples than people who are not married (but the lies they usually say tend to be "enormous").
We also know that if you are perceived as an evildoer, others will feel less guilty when lying to you.
How do I know if someone's lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called "creating a baseline."
Helps provide benchmarks to measure changes later.
Observe the subject's posture, laughter and vocal characteristic.
It's better to know if someone normally beats his foot all the time so he doesn't make unfair accusations when he sees his feet beating in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for deceptive, verbal and non-verbal behavior groups.
Consider these groups of behavior as alarm signals, not as evidence of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the top of the body by trying to remember their story, they can point their feet toward the door, lean towards an exit, change their posture significantly, or display a "post-interview shock" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions have ended.
Interrogators often falsely show that the interview has ended only to seek that post-interview relief.
He also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put his foot down and used the time he spent while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her at the national level.
People who cheat can also use a remote language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... until I... understand myself."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the pipeline diverted after the threat of US delay in its approval
Days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering the unions, as it appeased the environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's manager, Alex Pourbax, says the company maintains its confidence that over time the pipeline will be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes to avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater, are studied.
"This is a real way of progress," said Representative Lee Terry, Nebraska Republican, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to separate any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's request, and expressed his full support to them.
The 1,700-kilometre pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to refineries in Texas.
To do so, it would be necessary for him to cross six states.
He is hated by the environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have bet on the estimation of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposed to the plan are undermining legislation to force a distance from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's current environmental impact study found that the project only had limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department's inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a signature that was hired to run the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit with fear
A New York family claims that the disc music diva, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a mad woman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, landing her little daughter to the point where she threw up in fear.
The diatribe of the singer of "Lady Marmalade" scared Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, so much so that she suffered "changes of personality, sleep disorders" and "enhancing her fear of strangers," says her family at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when tram driver Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up from behind and said to me, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said "yes" and I went to get her," he said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left his daughter near the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J out loud...
I had a bottle of water and started throwing the water out of the bottle over me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," said the girl's mother.
LaBelle leaned over the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be contained in her environment and removed from a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but it did not get an answer.
Counsel and LaBelle representatives did not return calls to comment on what had happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money it can to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," Davis said.
"This type of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it is addressed to a kindergarten teacher who takes an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate adversity braked the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, lowered foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-denominated of change, which generated great expectations regarding the progress in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, no growth is observed, however there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of ice-cream impacts issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582,835 hectares were damaged, of which 78,03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main sinister crops were those of vegetables, maize and chickpea.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, as while between January and March 55,053 people were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate became 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in number casts more than 74 thousand unemployed people, an increase compared to the first half of 18,969 individuals.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out from public policy.
"What is being seen is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for the effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation that was passed at the congress to combat money laundering, as it is not easy for people who illegally grab dollars to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people leaving the state looking for work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and second because entering already have many difficulties to find work, these people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the Danish labour market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in the state works without being listed as a worker before any social security institution.
Along with unemployment and informality, another of the state's labor lags is low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of the Danish workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
FDI contraction
Along with the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there was the largest decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June of State FDI amounted to $630,697, representing a drop of 87.74 per cent compared to the $5,143,312 recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17,280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
Faced with the economic contraction scenario, the government of the state requested in July the approval of a credit for 3 billion pesos, the same that would be destined for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to revive the economy, the approval of the local congress was for a sum of 2,600 million pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, Mario López Valdés' first year of government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 he lacked the harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the government of the state itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we have failed to align the effort of everyone and above all the good and synchronized march of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as the ice creams of the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had," he mentioned.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he said that it is necessary to cause the state to productive activities of greater dynamism.
"We have generally observed that we have been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated," he said.
Work to be done
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better addresses the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been striving to achieve good results in various areas, in the area of economic development there is some progress, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its conduct of public policy.
"There are elements to say that the Government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I believe that the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
They're condemning him for 8 kg of marijuana.
Five years in prison and 100 days in fine, a neighbour of Navolato was sentenced for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney-General of the Republic reported that the sentenced narcomnudist is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by members of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite pole 80, in the village El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcomnutist was circulating in a white pickup truck, where he carried a black bag in the vehicle box and in the co-pilot's seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured person remained at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person continues to be interned at the Centre for the Enforcement of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
It must contribute to works
Social works included in programmes such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the work programmes have so far advanced, they are at risk because they have not complied with the Government of the State with its corresponding contributions, which add up to 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that in total the investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 per cent and that only the Federation and the Municipality have so far provided resources for the works, so that the possible delay in the completion of these works becomes effective.
"It's almost 12 million what they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth, when they had to give us a share since July," he said, "we have started the works and are going very far, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that did not provide on that occasion the state administration.
"It's already happened to us in the previous six years because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the State left outstanding," he explained.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to meet the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to expedite efforts to ensure that their respective percentages reach as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million what they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth."
Valid "analog apagon" cut in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional disputes brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog code" from 2021 to 2015, by not meeting the eight necessary votes to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be followed in order to realize the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and the decree remains in force.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a statutory power reserved for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favor of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and by admitting the lawsuits, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it prepared for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to reject the demand made by the Chamber of Deputies, without going into the discussion of the project, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in that the federal executive could not structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to be prepared.
"I also consider that if it were to do so, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected", and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, who has the constitutional mandate, the State's rectory.
The substitution of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and results in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitization, which implies a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "requires the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic rectory of the State, includes a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, which somehow invades the sphere of competence of Congress, since the observance of the laws issued by the legislature is being provided in the administrative sphere, ensured.
They analyze the possibility of a "vote by vote" account in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PRSP, the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of the "vote per vote" count is a reality with regard to this year's election process in Michoacán, where according to the data released by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), Maria de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just last November 9, the electoral body adopted a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve his Political Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or its Electoral Justice Act, since the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the completion of the legal deadline for them to enter into force in the present electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed to publish them within the time limits provided for in the Official Journal of the State Act, arguing that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislature and called it "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state's president on constitutional reforms, since he does not have the right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of "vote by vote", Maria de los Angeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the adoption of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be given on the assumption that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and counting in the file of the box or does not work in the possession of the president of the same; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the ballot boxes of the election may be made where there is evidence that the difference between the candidate who is presumed to be the winner of the election in question and the candidate who obtained the second place in the ballot is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express request from the party representative and/or coalition who applied to the second of the candidates indicated.
The total count of the vote may also be made if at the end of the ordinary count it is established that the difference between the candidate allegedly winning and the candidate located in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was second, in which case the electoral packages that have been partially counted will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation there is the choice of Morelia, where according to the PRSP the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16%, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.

They locate three abandoned corpses in Cadreyta NL estate
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime to the media.
Three men were found shot in different parts of the body and with the shooting of grace, in an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadreyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The finding occurred on the kilometer 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the brink of economic disaster
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A presidential palace statement announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present the president with the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "mark is now well outlined," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain the beating confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the performance of the Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which was forced by the crisis to resign on Saturday.
"We think Professor Monti's efforts are meant to have a good result," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centerright party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti Government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will probably be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure to warn that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
It will end your round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was named on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely fast transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will succeed.
To rescue Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before advancing the elections.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should be formed only by technicians, a sign of his repairs to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties are making the attempt to include political figures more complicated.
The rock of the Spaniards is superior to that of the ticks
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten outnumber the 50 international games.
On Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 summonses arrived at the 50 meetings.
A capital contrast to that of Costa Rica, compared to the 22 convened by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., in the National Stadium of San José.
While world and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly ranquin, account for a wide record of class A interselection games, Tricolor only owns defender Michael Umaña as the only one with the 50 international parties.
This figure reached her the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and powerful clubs of the Premier League of England maintain an intense activity in league championships and domestic cup, and high-level shocks in European cups such as Champions League.
In addition to the above, the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated eliminations of Eurocopa and World Cup football is added.
On the contrary, footballers possess a limited international rock in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish Selection is of the archer Iker Casillas, who on Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today in front of the Tricolor and will set a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, the brain steering wheel of Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenaries of the Iberian team, the mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke ram, Raúl González, with 102.
Close to the centenary is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tic side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and artilleryman Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five of them exceeded the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
More than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't get close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar owns only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
The historical goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa, with 50 dianas, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records as many with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country on his two-decade tour of history
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bass player Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them it will also become a reality the dream of playing in the country.
This was assured by bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week.
The grouping is on the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour of work and Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Angelina band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is in The Nation on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what their fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we're gonna be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to take our music there.
I ask you because there is a sort of devotion to the band, fans live intensely the previous days.
What do they say to their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even already refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they've been delivering huge shows with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we've never touched there before, then we have no restriction on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this about?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have been not playing for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have been forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think any of us think we'd be in a big rock band and have done it for more than 20 years ago that it looks like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and it thrills us so much that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world that we've always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of the grunge?
It's always been an honor to be part of that group of big bands.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement comes from a group of friends and it's something unusual.
From time to time, a band emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands leave at the same time from the same city.
We're proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we're lucky to be friends with all of them still and we're honored to be part of that sound from Seattle that came up.
It is also very strange for a band like yours to remain united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
Firstly, I believe that we are all fortunate to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance sheet?
As we've grown, it's been easier to find a balance sheet.
We make sure you're not too much of a tour because it's easy to fall into that game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as one remembers that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect music and what brought it, without being captivated by being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were many frustrations because it would last so long and most important is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with various proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change Yellow Ledbetter's lyrics live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he does it with the first thing you can think of.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There's so many of them.
One of the first things I've heard is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many people I could talk about all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant even though it is no longer a fashion?
I think all of us always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had darker content and has now become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breake that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed touched them, I cried when I heard them and they're deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his head doctor reported.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several illnesses, including cancer in the language by which he has been operated four times and remains under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told Channel N of television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he did not want it because he is known innocent.
It was operated four times from cancer to the tongue, it has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other pathologies have been combined such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreas cyst, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor enumerated.
Fujimori has been in detention since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Operations of the Police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will launch a visit to Mexico this Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican partner, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "appropriate for the exchange of information on all political issues between the two nations", according to the South American presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when French president Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay's rejection and the call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group composed of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the establishment of tax exchange agreements in order to emerge from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), formed by countries that did not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004 which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustached plumber passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, tirelessly, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but never until now had he done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to the stores all over the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for that support", since so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to engage less skilled users.
Once overtaken, the more experts will be able to give a "second turn" to the levels of play, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional Super Mario incursion also involves the character's return to a portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo makes guineas to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of previous deliveries, consisting in the fact that the moustache fountain will have to travel platforms mined with dangers in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in the movements, the environments, the costumes and the enemies as well as a "playable" Luigi.
Colom supports Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he proceeded with the extradition of ex-Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the conspiracy to wash $70 million.
This is the end of the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that was demanding Portillo to try it there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was based on the independence of judicial and executive authorities, bearing in mind that a sentencing court had already ordered extradition.
He stated that during his term "he did not put his hands" in court decisions and dealt with all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, they will be extradited Sergio Ruano Marroquín, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did is an executive process after all the judicial and constitutional bodies were exhausted to prosecute the ex-employee from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted by the collapse of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process ahead of extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid falling into the marginality of untrained boys
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century.
In addition, the 100 jobs currently available for this social group have been filled.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an event held at the former Fabra i Coats manufacturing complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of degradation or in a situation of falling into marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of heads of entities and institutions that have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former councillor of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current ecosocialist councillor Ricardo Gomà attended the event.
They also attended the large hall of Fabra i Coats, the current councillor of Benestar Social i Familia, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
More stated that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present one is also, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example of how to fight the bad circumstances and give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Displaced an okupada farm where they made macrofests
The invaders had owned 11 of the 13 floors of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday afternoon the illegally occupied property, where they organized macro-fests that were desperate for the neighborhood, in court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation ended, the door lock was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on there will be an access control," said the administrator.
The ukupas, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the crowd parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the club points out that the invaders of the farm made him unfair competition, since they sold the cups for three euros, while in the club they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure place had had to respond to neighborhood noise complaints, while, according to the report, the discomforts did not provoke the clients of the club, but the inhabitants of the okupada house and, above all, the attendees of the parties organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The club manager explained that the troubles were so great that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago he "forgave" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks he had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the PP municipal group in the city hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately dislodge the property to end the problems of coexistence and civicism that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the occupied building, but over the last few months the ukupas had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that there have even been robberies in some.
In this regard, he added, "it is necessary to end impunity and to be blunt against the incivism that has been generated in the farm."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police headed up to 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens debate on Collserola's role in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some promotional pasquins of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again placed, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but above (mountain) -down (sea).
Collserola's rating as a natural park is based on this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these, it was until, in September, the city council convened a megacompetition consisting of 16 competitions for so many other gateways to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put doors to the field.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it implies of reflection on the city is the theme of conversation among all the Barcelona architects.
It's almost already a recurring issue to hand over when two members of this former caste of elects are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects think, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Módol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary" to discuss "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It should start from the base that Barcelona's most extensive park is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", says the architect for whom the title of "collserola gates" encloses a "lexic trap": there is no need to think of them "as the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of areas where to act".
Módol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanistic world, qualifies the proposal as "intellectual right" with "some dangers".
Hazards derived from the "uncertainty that today it is to project public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that it had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of a border over where it can be built.
"Limiting something is already fixing the next step," that is, its overrun.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current ones [referring to the Metropolitan General Plan (GMP)] can give rise to real disasters."
More consistent with the question, Mòdol believes that, simplifying, the valley of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", for a merely topographical question.
Módol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not fall into broken sack", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers to his staff to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("everything is right", points) that have had to create: "Arquitects should be just a tool".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest there is a global view of Collserola: "16 cross-sectional contests have been convened - it says - in the sense of mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This results, at least in your case, in choosing to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can clash in program and definition with that of the architect of the door next door.
In his view, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately superior to the Dalt Round should provide, in its entirety, for an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and will go free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal estate of Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed by alleged blackmails
After staying 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal estate of the Casino Red has granted him forgiveness before the District Second Criminal Court, which follows a blackmail process against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack at Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay an economic fee so that the regional council would allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
Following the public complaint, the State Attorney's Office opened a criminal proceedings against the Panista mayor's brother and on 2 September was arrested and held for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor's Office 3 in Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
In that place he remained for 49 days following the issuance of a second warrant after the Public Prosecutor ' s Office dismissed the crimes of rocket and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadreyta's prison allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red with a million and a half pesos; however, he only stayed for a few hours in the middle security prison since there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was given an arrest warrant by the District Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, who said that nearly two months after the investigation, sufficient evidence was found to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the 1.5 million pesos charge to the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing the operation of the gambling house.
On Monday, Casino Red's legal attorney, Victor Aldo García Gómez, went to judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the royal mayor; so in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's Office officer attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the gambling partners was the one who granted forgiveness, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is granted legal pardon and will not be able to file any complaints about the proceedings that followed him; in addition to the fact that he will not be required to be compensated for damages or punishment.
After the court hearing, the legal guardian of the betting house, about 15:50, Larrazabal Breton's immediate freedom was ordered.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yanez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be archived.
It shall also notify him of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionysio Pérez Jacome gives details of the air accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, and seven more people lost their lives.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others lost their lives indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the asps had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport staff.
In addition, he said that investigations conducted in the impact area do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In one search there are reports that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The helicopter's design was for 19 passengers, with proper requirements to transport passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have the results before possible; however, the investigation may last several months, even one year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Staff helicopter operated at cruising speed and that this happened on a soft ascending terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, TBS headliner Pérez Jácome listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical normivity the flight was conducted under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
The reports at the AICM placed conditions suitable for take-off, as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico presented low-level cloud layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloud conditions the crew have sought a zone of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and side-by-side trajectory.
The pattern of dispersion of aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the disaster there is still no evidence in the remains of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the field.
During the fieldwork, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9 thousand 200 feet above the mid-sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictablely disarticulated along that route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a wider area than the agreed site around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, which reinforces the presumption that the impact was presented in structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Leads Social Security an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting a research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetic Protocol on Obesity of Childhood and Adolescents', which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Biochemistry Medical Research Unit of the Specialty Hospital of the National Medical Center of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, the population is invited to participate in the study, whether or not it is entitled, to attend the sports units participating in the IMSS in the Valle de México, where the tests are carried out for minors, every Saturday from 8 a.m.
He pointed out that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico Poniente) and that since 8 October, the activity has been carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico East).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independent Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day was celebrated on 14 November, the goal was to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that Saturdays apply to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (the aim is to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this research is due to the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 per cent in obesity, and of girls of 47 per cent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic increase was also observed,' said IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others because of its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent American Indian inheritance, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which allows for the detection of any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, the doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, to whom each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent disease are explained.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the television and use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to high caloric intake, i.e. the increased consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics that is analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid bumps
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sent by the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 basins each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt floor is the right one, the basins could be reduced in quantity or even completely eliminated.
In his lecture A technological opinion of the baches, dictated within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, revealed that the laboratory in charge develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Najera estimated that this type of modified asphalts could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and therefore the formation of bumps.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, some of them of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called Maltese, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrade it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform, but is changing during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist in chemical engineering warned.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitutes the folder, pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
By transiting the vehicles and generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt, it would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphaltic folder, it abounded, a last layer called rolling folder is placed, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that also bathes in asphalt.
Since it is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling folder also requires to have the proper thickness and care should be taken of the material that is made of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphaltic folder.
When the soil is wet, the water is diffused inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a softening of all layers of the pavement and therefore the formation of patches.
In the process of forming a batch, he said, the first one to wear is the rolling film and only afterwards is affected the asphalt folder, but the damage does not happen instantly, but it is a process that should be attended to the first signs with proper maintenance programs.
The member of the National Researcher System also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of bumps and, therefore, the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is fulfilled, in order to avoid frequent bumps.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already found even in the market and allow repairing batches easily and without needing to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Signorita Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 Princess.
Once again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to conform to being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that believe her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantica rose with the crown and the scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of Vallecaucana women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many ask themselves is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation proved that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of Police and Best Rostro Jolie de Vogue, titles that obtained queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the jury's decision to appoint her First Princess is that she did not agree with her answer to the question "What is that book that marked you and why?" made by Martin Murillo Gómez of the Leamos Literary Road.
To the interrogator the Vallecaucana replied:
"I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely believe that the book that marked me as a child is "The Prince," it's a pretty deep book.
Today I read "Crimen and Punishment", is a book of universal literature that we must all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
A response that little liked first by the term "culturalization" and second by not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he cited have marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony he manifested himself feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise passing what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little bit, "The Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses put forward, Valle was said to have been burned by favoritism.
A Bogotan journalist hinted that by being the favorite, ovate and candidate who took all the preliminary awards (the Oster Gastronomy Challenge, public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the Queen and therefore did not shine on the stage."
And that was noted in his first presentation in swimsuit on Hilton Beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
Although both of them looked secure, it was noted that he lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "How to Home" program of the RCN Canal, said that the fact that Melina was appointed princess "checks that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition is not as queen".
In addition, Valle showed himself to the last very elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For something, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman who was committed to her country's social needs.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, which before entering the Contest are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned due to her defects in the back and the fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queen's preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very well known, dropped points on the last day."
Meanwhile journalist Guido Hoyos, from Cromos magazine, considers that the error of the Vallecaucana was the surgical interventions that was practiced.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her fort and here she was charged."
For this prize, which for the first time delivers the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in swimsuit a cruel vaticin arose that was fulfilled last night, as it was said that this was the contentilla Raymundo gave Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass into history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was elusive to her crown.
So it was the work of the horse that identified Alfonso Cano's body.
A lobbyist from Cali went into history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
Last November 4, a lobbyist from Cali's ITC went on to history as the man who confirmed the identity of the Farc's top chief: "Alfonso Cano", through the collage of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the ITC sectional, that week was the turn of "availability" to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
When he began his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to go into the jungle for more than five days to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, he specialized in lophoscopia, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is, the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected of being the man who was leading the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to carry Guillermo León Sáenz's decactilary card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize him because of his physical appearance, as he was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a local farmer, no glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those of the card.
His eye didn't fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the chief of the Farcs.
In search of the footprint
For a Dactiloscopist from the Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, that can become key in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lophoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals present false ballots or have no papers.
We take the fingerprint and search them in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, he touched to remove a piece of wall from a house, for in that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewels and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to draw a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the print of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also rule out or reaffirm suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a print on the bottle coincided.
Although this doesn't guarantee it was the killer, it does place it at the crime scene.
A CTI dactiloscope explained that in objects "fingerprints are taken with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," CTI expert said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the CSI television program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that you touch becomes footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective check is made.
The "indignant" challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part answered the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to re-enter Manhattan Square under a court order, where they were evicted early in the morning, and by trying to occupy another Great Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters were dying in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allowed the "indignados" to recamp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction occupying a park further north of the city, where there had been new arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the court doesn't allow us to recamp in the square, we're going to settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-downs and demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the Occupy Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "indignant" to the eviction of his camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced eviction from the site and allowing protesters to remain camped.
In addition, the "indignados" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and property of Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are several hundred people who had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been displaced in support of the members of the movement and who have tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private property facility - remains closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for this very Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some of the protesters displaced there carried and distributed copies of that court order at this time and even handed them over to the agents who guarded the square, which caused "some small clashes," said Bray, who reported that some officers beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from dislodging the members of Occupa Wall Street or applying "laws that were published after the occupation began or to prohibit protesters from re-entering the park with stores or other properties they used previously."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, due to this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the protesters, who, however, warned that local laws did not allow them to re-install themselves with tents and sleeping bags.
The governor personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square at dawn, an operation in which around 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violation of the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses had received threats" and the neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"The eviction of this morning was gross and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving financial interests than those of American workers," the spokesman for the movement added, who accused the mayor of "lacking respect for freedom of expression."
Officials of "Occupa Wall Street" also indicated that they intend to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that lasted the protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special television Christmas
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a helper in "Baywatch", a "Playboy" bunny, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the internet of a pornographic home video in which he appears along with his husband, the drums of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comic artist of Indian origin who recently acted as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Christmas has Canadian singer Bublé, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is no stranger to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "Zorra" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Reborn After the Earthquake · Global Voices
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, yet convalescent by the devastating earthquake that has emerged in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the country has suffered since World War II.
The first estimates by the Government of Tokyo accounted for material losses of $30 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to move on, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at an annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the rebound in the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared with the decrease of 0.9 per cent in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revulsive of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that calls for the use of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructures, to use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "housing values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the turbulent US forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic flotation line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, stuck their weak results between July and September to the Yen's quote.
As markets continue to siege the peripheral countries of the EU, Yoshihiko Noda's government does not lower its guard.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) specified that most member countries presented in September clearer signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the points of inflection in the world economy highlighted that the major powers are slowing down.
As it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 August.
The euro area, even, was below the average, which is at level 100, as it precipitated eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again feeds doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With the peripheral risk premiums fired and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to entangle in the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government is more imposed by the requirements of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date on 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit on 26 October," Papadimos said in opening yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not cast doubt on his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unlock the 8 billion Athens urgently needed, and made it clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still chosen by the impact caused by the ordago of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesman for economic affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek maedia still has a thread for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a prominent place at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essential" stated that it is a "tool for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations with a 2015 horizon, and, "very especially, in the one that aims to halve the volume of people living on incomes below a daily dollar, with which the "poverty threshold" is fixed.
Spain "continues working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Dona Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originated at the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
They are "many of the achievements achieved" and "many of the challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit is proposed not only as a forum for discussion, but also as a platform from which to push "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that he hoped that by the end of 2015 there would be 175 million poor families who had access to these financial services and 100 million of them would leave the poverty line on which they were left.
The impulse in the conception of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path begun years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlights Dona Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And it is that she described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work she has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose link with this project earned him yesterday the qualification of the "head of the family" assembled in Valladolid by the "baquero of the poor".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic goodwill, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits imply "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" developed country governments must work on solidarity criteria and not let it be a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For its part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluded to all who close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity".
CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulty to Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe had initially not been included in the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policy is currently too narrow with the Greeks and could be so in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted practically unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The several-minute standing ovation that was won, with her interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clear any doubt possible.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe represents peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to pave the way in Europe".
This could be reflected in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to enable the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give Europe a face".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Without a doubt, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a crushing majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the European Central Bank directive according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
Anxious for calming the moods inside her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But neither has she tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except in the past.
Recalling that two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government are undertaking an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, November 15, in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for family allowances and to give a speech on the subject, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the willingness to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the presidential right-wing campaign, most want to focus on sickness breaks.
Firstly, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day's deficit on private sector workers before they can take the fall.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days' pay, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but which would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose a day of non-remunerated absence in the event of job losses (to date, they are not lacking, compared to the three days that are applied in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority are putting on the table again the issue of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuse of job losses.
"The controls will be considerably increased and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing a fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned in RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the impact of the announcement seems slightly disproportionate to the reality of job losses fraud.
In fact, since 2002 there has been a constant follow-up to this issue and a number of political offensives have been launched, which have usually been successful.
The French only get sick in the rest of Europe.
Let us look carefully, first of all, at national figures.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), in 2006 more than 237 million euros were paid for unemployment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, subsidies for casualties accounted for 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this sum, 46 per cent is for maternity and occupational accidents, while 54 per cent is for sickness, which amounts to EUR 6.2 billion.
Consequently, 2.5 per cent of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that certainly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of Sickness Insurance, indicates that in 2010 37 per cent of sick leavers lasted less than 8 days, 22 per cent between 8 and 14 days, 15 per cent between 15 days and one month, 15 per cent between 1 and 3 months and 11 per cent were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to catch sickness breaks.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate of work (both for health and other reasons) ranged from 10% to 11% in France, from 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% to 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
The scope of fraud is quite limited.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on sick leave for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13 per cent of the 285,000 carried out, that the short-term casualties were "unwarranted or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be "due to adaptation or unjustified; a figure of 1.2 million was considered to be 132,000.
Thus, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases were reached among several million workers who took a sick leave.
Undoubtedly, an insignificant figure compared, for example, to work in black.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent tax revenue losses of between €9,000 and €15 billion per year, i.e. more than the total cost of low-income subsidies and, no doubt, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten out its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said on Monday 14 November in front of Parliament; he also added that the 100 days granted to his Government of Union would not be enough to achieve this goal.
"To make efforts to bring about economic recovery, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, since "the country's stay in the euro area is at stake," he added.
As a result, Papadémos has foreseen that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right rejects new austerity measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing group, showed his support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with the deputies of his "New Democracy" party.
He noted that he agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, as well as combating waste, but against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary 8,000 million euro loan without a written guarantee of support from all parties for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
An expert committee states that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Canadian society continues to deny death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient raises this option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
For starters, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death."
On medication or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to the experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded by Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or suicide assisted with non-competent persons or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada, assisted suicide is practised, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Let us remember that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia, as they believe that it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, as indicated by an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
As for those who have been involved in assisted suicide, 41 per cent of the respondents are of the view that a trial against them should not be initiated.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of a patient's health care, the situation is not so clear, as reported by the authors of the report.
Furthermore, among their recommendations, they suggest that the Criminal Code states that the removal of health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect the fact that a patient rejects end-of-life care without fear of facing a complaint.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations regarding the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to the terminally ill.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and over 18 years of age can ask for help to commit suicide," says Deschamps, who consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the findings of the report, which she described as "manifesto in favor of euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, particularly challenges the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon power
Damascus denounces a "comlot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The supporters of Bashar El Asad spoke yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on Syria of Bashar El Asad intensified, which, with the support of Russia, resists and denounces that there is a "comlot" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League's suspension of Syria, the European Union has reinforced sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, have expressed their support for the abandonment of power by President Asad.
Jordan's King Abdalá II was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar El Asad to "leave power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that Turkey's mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and are unable to satisfy them will leave," he said alluding to Syria, a neighbouring country in which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly harsh tone" with regard to repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, spokesman for the State Department.
In the meantime, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces have already died in the Deraa region in southern Syria, as announced by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al Muelem, considered that the country "progress towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, it has reacted firmly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damask from his duties, which in its view constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not weaken," he added, ensuring that "the plotting against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, has also expressed support for the dispatch of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which, in his view, is contained in "paranoia".
A further extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which envisages, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, judged yesterday as "incorrect" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan of the crisis, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time to the markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has requested some time from the markets to form his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" aimed at recovering the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with political parties and today met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, deputy of one of the abundant small parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the Designated Council.
For his part, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he hopes that Mario Monti will request a vote of confidence in Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, no doubt a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In the "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its programme, he stressed, adding that he is "sure that the markets will be patient and understand it".
Its designation by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but then the concern was imposed, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team composed mainly of technocrats, even if he has emphasized that he would like to include "politics".
The new Government will have to operate until 2013, the date of the next legislature, he believes.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get Parliament's vote of confidence before Friday.
Monti has committed himself to working, when he is in office, taking into account the urgency and with the objective that Italy "recovers its role" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, it will not change our diagnosis of the Italian economy".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further rigorous measures.
Italian "chief of chiefs" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see her mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "because a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements".
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), assumes a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place some €20 billion in state bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, according to an American NGO specialized in atomic risk on Monday.
For the identification of the investigator, the Institute of International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA expressed last week its "serious concern" over a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had been working for three decades since the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk, Oural, and had been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
His company's economic problems would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Subsequently, it is believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, according to one Member State to the Agency, worked for most of his career in nuclear technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50 per cent
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while, during the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, as reported by statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall 14 per cent increase in the number of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these crimes and crimes have increased again," said Human Rights First, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long been pointing out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds an organization leader, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and should strive to put an end to such abuses," he adds, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin colour, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site modified the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes their service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another so-called "name" tab allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Twittos", i.e., of those netizens whose messages ("tweets") are still on the Internet or following you.
This allows you to know if they follow up on messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they qualify as favorite any messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, according to AFP Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to send a message from another person, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) doing the happiness of the initiates, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the Facebook and Google+ general public networks.
In the network, users have discussed at the stroke of "tweets" with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budget "gold rule" in the Constitution
The government of the great Social Democratic/Christian coalition in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budget "gold rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced by one level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay €3,000 million more in interest each year," said Christian Vice-Citizen of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area countries of 26 October: it called for the inclusion, by the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law with equivalent value.
The mechanism adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
Prior to 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, starting in 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states, as well as the communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 by 60% as set out in the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention of the exchange market
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene the mark of change if the yen continued to increase.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we prove that excessive volatility occurs" at the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historical peaks that produced the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been gradually rising since then, driven by the purchases of investors who regard it as a "safeguard value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crises in Europe.
The dollar returned on Tuesday to less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was quoted at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the Made in Japan products and reduces the value of income earned abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), Noda stressed, fearing that the increase of the root-cutting yen the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five billion yen (47 billion euros), bringing to 55 billion yen (519,000 euros) the threshold of funds dedicated to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
The guys grow up, the bags weaken
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weaker countries continue to increase.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European stock exchanges sink a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., ACC 40 loses 1.4 per cent and is set at 3,064 points.
Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"Given the new tensions in relation to the yields of loans from the most affected euro area States, stock markets around the world continue to yield some of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing the concerns of market players regarding Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed look in Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a limited range of variations, so investors will not have proof that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The re-emergence of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has remained at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 o'clock, the European currency was worth $1,3570, a drop of 0.4%.
According to the runners, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion providing, in particular, for an option for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish types exceed by more than 6%
The credit rates of Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85 per cent, while Spanish securities at the same time offered 6.2 per cent.
These tensions in relation to interest rates in the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is at the point of view of the markets, while on Sunday the legislative elections will be held there.
The difference in types ("spread") between 10-year obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
Pending growth figures for the euro area
From the statistical point of view, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than the projected 0.3 per cent, driven by domestic consumption.
Insee, however, has revised the figure for the second quarter downwards, with a 0.1 per cent reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m. after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an election meeting be the time to reflect on such issues and the place of nuclear energy.
The discussion will only be useful if it considers the full economic, social and environmental implications of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will lead to the doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing shortage of fossil resources will have to be alleviated in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
Fukushima's accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
That is not the case either with Belgium, which is subject to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor with Switzerland, which is only intended to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to cite a few examples, are continuing with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such a discourse.
The choice of Berlin will entail an increase in the price of electricity, a greater energy dependence on the increased need for gas imported, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
Within a few months, the harmful effects will be noted.
It should be considered in the case of Denmark.
European champion in the wind sector, of which 30% of its electricity is obtained, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to wind intermittentness; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the record of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from Europe's cheapest electricity.
For this reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would reduce realism to the wonderful declarations about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not show opposition at first to this type of energy, as the surveys show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 executive jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets that can create non-displaceable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would result in the slaughter of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of EUR 6 billion per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to operate sixty years, when the collapse of its manufacturer is expected?
In order to solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, as there is no diabolical source.
The development by Areva of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority with strict and transparent control over both existing power stations and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In the middle of a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not cause consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and to unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While studying it all the electric actors who want to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, as it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "human rights countries" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see Libération newspaper of May 23rd) proclaiming in the past that France "needs no foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely economically analyzed.
The point is that, on this subject, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac fixed the orientation stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone set it Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't take care of all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande merely includes trivialities, indicating that co-development will solve the "problem of migration".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be profitable electorally, but economically it comes out very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
The limitation of immigration weakens growth and undermines employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular the low-skilled, by pushing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and are mainly engaged in occupations in sectors with a lack of employment.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anaesthetics, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to have a positive impact on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Taking this into account, Giovanni Peri estimated that an increase of 1% in migration flows represents an increase in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9 per cent.
And, regardless of the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel Prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they provide an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 years will make a net contribution (low-cost income) of EUR 150,000 to public average budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his tenure, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go look for the growth points that he lacked "with his teeth".
These teeth, which dissuade immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious but also fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know from Napoleon the Little One that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and a control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return from the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
You must reflect on this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and disorderly.
A blank signature of the absolute European monarch or a halt to the vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to make an impact, but we want a common exercise, of full right, calm and continuous, of the options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that is governed by the orders of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers from humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for popular sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investments.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to the disaster.
Having fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors for a long time, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
So be it.
But thinking of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new impasse.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The interest-motivated revolution would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It will only be possible to build a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let's make Europeans.
Cards with "no contact" chip are generalised
The global chip card lounge starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an increase of 11% in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM cards phones, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart cabinet calculations.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for common transportation or purchases simply by approaching the card to a reader.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with no contact chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (a forecast of 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the world market for chip cards (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time, is gaining ground in the non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are being used without contact.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
To put the top gear, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have committed themselves to spreading systematically in the future, among their customers, bank cards equipped with the contactless system," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Mobile Phone Payment
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
At present, there are few devices equipped with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, which is essential for the conduct of transactions.
"They're being held back."
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We expect between 80 and 120 million units to be sold in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones will be equipped with about 200 customers and collaborators with a cover that allows contactless payment.
The OPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the Société General has also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which had long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algiers already "has the certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports demonstrate that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the walkways.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the following day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French Special Forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls made points to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers captured especially the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who supposedly is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly wait to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect has enjoyed external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in his operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices and in the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pushing Abuya to take into account the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long regarded the group as a community of illumined, unworthy of interest.
A Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the partnership is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the sharia, while its militants launch themselves into the struggle against the wicked central government.
The latter are primarily oriented to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and attacks against police stations increased.
Abuya's reaction was, as usual, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has been radicalizing and abandoning its northern fiefs.
Last Christmas, claims an attack that causes 80 dead in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the police's protected headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations headquarters became its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would span from Mauritania to Somalia passing through Nigeria, worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A America weakened by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplistic ones?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more strenuous statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The slogans, often unfounded, spread over China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race for designation by the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "by manipulation of their currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments from their sector to Asia.
Even if that involves the explosion of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama's Ambassador to China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that "paves" emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current Obama position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the probes, is still inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt its nuclear programme.
"If I get elected, I'll stop Iran," he freaked out.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed with his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-classified candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "trys to develop nuclear capability", apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing, for his part, to deploy the U.S. army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty exit of Iraq's "boys" and on their misconceptions in Libya, and label it weak.
But attacks are not easy for them.
The population is rather positive about Obama's national security balance, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he distrusts the military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that it is necessary to economically rebuild America to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
North Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the Baltic coast, between the orchestra's music and a delicate buffet, at the inauguration of the North Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have together turned the steering wheel of the valve controlling Russian gas entry into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe through a first had 1,224 km that communicate the region of St. Petersburg with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012 which will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, i.e. sufficient to cover all French consumption.
In addition, we are already talking about the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work presents the airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, North Stream is going to allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding the passage of land by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe's energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has been able, in just five years, to win its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically," said François Fillon during the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the major gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom managers, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it against anchors of ships.
It rests at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to extend measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted throughout its length: either by valves or by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden's waters, but the project leaders renounced it by seeing that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to permanently establish itself at sea off its shores.
"In case of failure, we will interrupt the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders find it unlikely that a leak will occur, since they have foreseen joints that, according to the forecasts, will have a leak every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by means of a submarine robot, carried out by a ship, carrying out external inspections, as well as by means of a device circulating inside the pipeline.
With the shape of a cigar, it is inserted into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without the need for any kind of repair.
Gas circulation is guaranteed simply by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
To it, the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to that company, for a period of twenty-five years renewable, all the capacities for the transport of gas.
"Gazprom will pay you for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas you actually transport," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been carried out by 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be 7,400 million euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom alone assumes the risk of spending.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pines.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas upon arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine booklet is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, Moleskine librettos with the current appearance were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design notebook, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant of the company, took charge of the launch of the new product.
The booklet is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin (top leather), which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of booklet was highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who since then has become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And it achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Far away is the confidential production of the first few years, in which only 3,000 booklets were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open spirit and cults.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers in its beginnings, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the center of the cities, and has been able to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard tapas, for the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer covers... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that causes envy: in autumn 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of disabled people are seeking employment.
The 15th week for the employment of the disabled begins today.
Despite a determined public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared with 9 per cent for the entire population.
Disappointing?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, Managing Director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress achieved for 15 years is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, much remains to be done."
It should be mentioned that the disabled continue to face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 years old ( 17% average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53 per cent for the disabled, compared with 38 per cent on average.
In other words, there are many issues that make it especially difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the quid of the problem," says Christian Grabin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
Moreover, there are those who are not mentioned; people's mentality is moving forward, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for Cité pointed out that the surveyed directors have "a level of knowledge about low disabilities", with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually disabled".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set out in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, which date back to 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6 per cent.
"We now reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The test: the number of establishments "submitted to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, has decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has created great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a true awareness, particularly among the big groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of companies with between 20 and 49 employees have disabled employees in their workforce, compared with 82 per cent of companies with between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "A joy"
About to face the Blues on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure generated by this friendly party.
We will not dare say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazards have actually made peace at the stand of the Stadium of France auditorium.
Five months after his frontman's grudge against Turkey, the Belgian selector has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for her progress and for being Belgian."
"I want to move forward," Lille's frontman replied.
As for the contrast between his presentations on his team and in the selection, "it's a set", has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year round, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to settle down."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, considering this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brillar".
Not forgetting the placer.
He has been encouraging the Blues since he was seven years old, as well as during the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been your fan," he says.
Without a doubt, this will especially reinforce the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), " he recalls.
"We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made reference to the "proud".
"Pride" for fighting "a gala game."
"Pride" also for checking, as "neighbor", that France "renewed to be a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a great job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share plane with the Blues towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up," he said.
"We're building something; players are ambitious, hungry.
"You will be able to see him in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Portugal of Paulo Bento faces a great optimism for the back match against Bosnia (22:00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the game of going, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the Selection, which has been running since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Euro Cup.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the game of going (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given it peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored out of the house."
But at home, at the bright Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the party is "very equal, " said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the party is very equal, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in the Eurocopa 2012", the successor of Carlos Queiroz has, however, relativized.
The Friday tie in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a tie, although they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored out of the house," Bento regrets.
"We're going to play against a team that has great technical quality and that has players with great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "don't leave them time to think."
A good idea, as long as, this time, it's realistic.
