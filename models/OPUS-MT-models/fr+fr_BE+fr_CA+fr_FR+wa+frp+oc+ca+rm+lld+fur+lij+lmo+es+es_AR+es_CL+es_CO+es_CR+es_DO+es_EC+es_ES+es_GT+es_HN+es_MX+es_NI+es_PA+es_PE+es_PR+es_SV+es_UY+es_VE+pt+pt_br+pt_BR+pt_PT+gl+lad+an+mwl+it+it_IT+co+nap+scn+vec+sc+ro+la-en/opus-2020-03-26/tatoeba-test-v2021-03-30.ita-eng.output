I don't drink alcohol.
Looks like there's no way out.
We fell asleep.
I was very upset with him.
Why should we help you?
I put the plan into practice.
I made a list.
For a while I was really addicted to Coca-Cola, and I drank it every day.
I think Tom is turning us around.
Africa is exporting beef to Europe.
Did you tell Tom why you want to go to Boston?
Tom and Mary are gone now.
The more we are, the better it is.

I went to the beach with Tom and his friends.

I'm totally satisfied with my new home.
Why do you study English every day?
I'd like to cross the United States of America with a convertible.

These monks live inside the monastery.
I just have to find him.
Can I see this?
He can speak in Japanese.
I might be wrong.
You're afraid to sleep, aren't you?
Tom will find a job soon enough.
Correct the underlined words.
Did you tell him you were kidding?
Keep looking.
When the results are made public, I'll let you know.
I wanted to go back to your village.
Tom is pleased with his success.
You're reliable.
I didn't even consider it.
It's better to have friends in the square than cash.
You can only smoke on the terrace.
I agree with 100%.
These flowers besides being beautiful also have a good scent.
You're at college now, aren't you?
We should call him.
It's interesting how it happened.
You should remember that.
Tom said he likes to teach French.
He pulled a coin out of his pocket.
Are you related to her?
Who broke this window?
I'll go tell them.
If you heard him speak French, you'd trade him for a Frenchman.
It came ten minutes later.
We waited for him yesterday.
Tom said Mary was low.
Where's the exit?
If I remember correctly, Tom sold his car to Mary for just $500.
I'll call you after lunch.
We didn't agree on anything!
It's very unlikely.
No doctor can explain it.
I have to try it.
You're depressed.
You're wasting my time.
Aren't you Mary's husband?
It was all your imagination.
I'm not going to vote!
Why can't you do that?

It'll happen soon.
I saw my sister there.
Why don't you try to fix it?
We've definitely made too many mistakes.
I hope to see you tomorrow.

I'd be happy to give you a ride.
He tried to get up early.
I like blue.
They have many different fish to try.
What is the difference between real diamonds and imitations?
Could you call me later?
I'd like two copies of each of these documents.
I expect I'll have to do it for Tom.
What do you think of the new teacher?
If actions are stronger than words, why is the pen stronger than the sword?
She bought a tea service.
We're all gonna die.
Tom continued to cry.
I can't do this yet.
George was out of his mind!
You misled me.
Are you willing to learn?
The poor are also people with feelings.
I'm sure Tom is just trying to help.
You smell so good.
I forgot all about them.
He doesn't use it.
I'm disorderly.
I know a good Italian restaurant.
We can't let him die.
As far as I know, Tom is retired.
What time do you leave here?
I usually drink a lot of milk.
With a smile, anything is possible.
I like black and strong coffee.

Let's not drink.
I came back from school, and then I went out with my friends.

I got home late last night.
We finished the gas in the middle of the desert.
Don't worry, I'll come home safe and sound.

He was often up late.
I don't often eat bananas.
Get him out of here.

Maybe you should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
Get a move on, guys.
I like your painting.
I waited an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom is so sad.
I want to share this with you.
I'm studying at Hyogo University.
We'll take part in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life proceeded smoothly.
No one wants to help us.
They talk very fast.
Tom was lucky at first.
It's urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He had no money to buy the farm.

We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom needs to sleep now.
Tom is not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.

That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?

Don't break my heart.
I don't have plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be rich like you.
We had fun.
It's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got angry.
I'm already old.
I have a dirty criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
I bought a book in English in a bookstore.
I'm going to the bookstore tomorrow to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.

Tom needs to eat.
All of you, go.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I'm following you.

Worse and worse!

You've done well here.
Where'd all the others go?
I'm relaxed.
The cattle were grazing in the field.
He got in the way of his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for an appointment.
Tom is still absent.
I ate all the apple.
Sprinkle the bhakri while the pot is heated.
Is the park open today?
We only prepare Uighur food.
We're leaving Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom played soccer.
Stop babbling.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I understood it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
You're good at this game, aren't you?
Take care of them.
I live in Fiji.
Do you want to eat with us?
Doesn't sound too surprised.
I'm not going to school on Saturday.

I'm very disappointed.

He ate an apple.
I caught him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You need to get more active.
Is Tom and Mary kidding?
It broke out of smoke.
I have no choice.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than he is.
What's he gonna do this summer?
He got pissed off.
Can you speak Shanghai?
It narrowed down because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.

Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
Am I in London?
He's still there with you, isn't he?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
What's your favorite rapper woman?
Say hello to Tom for me.
It's nice to see you so happy.
I usually swim in summer.
Why is he leaving early?
I'm pretty proud of it.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's your picture.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom is lucky.
Give me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a conference.
There are no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for the lesson.
It's a little overweight, isn't it?
Who's the man playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all his income on drinking.
Look harder on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You sound like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what am I supposed to tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom pulsated her.
I don't have feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When's your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unresolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
It's snowing today.

I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich Boston girl.
I forgot whether you drink wine or not.
Who warned them?
He had faith in God.
"I'll give 50 grand for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay in the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated him.
I'm almost every day.
I'm not going to apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer night.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He looked in his bag for the keys to the car.
I really don't want to talk.
So it must be Argentinian.
I really like my job.
I'd suggest you be more careful.
She's shocked.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom is dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
No one wants to help you.
It'll clear up in the afternoon.

I thought it was a combination.
What do you see when you look at that picture?

Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.

If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom is still sleeping.
Tom is a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but what you want.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?

Fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you have anything to say?
The scandalous!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue dry.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're back early.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
Would you like to take this?

There are some books on the table.
Come at least at six.
I have a lot of work to finish by the weekend.

Are you Mary?
After dinner, take a walk on the beach.
Why didn't you go with him?
It's two years older than him.

Let's listen to music.
I think it's dangerous for children to play in the pond.
She bought me a nice coat.
The bell rang.
Take him to the men in room 318.
I'm falling in love with her.

This happened to me.
He doesn't have a few friends in America.

Tell us something.
You're casual.
Please turn the music down.
I train Tom for work.
He was watching him swim.
Who broke the vase?

He's a man of his word.
I'm free tonight.
Do you think I'm too tall?
What should we do now?

Are you telling me you're not busy?
He hates bats.
Go home.

How about a beer?
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one coin.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a moment.
Let's eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the picture on.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where did you have lunch?
He's the last person who can tell a lie.
June isn't that far, either.
Why does Tom hate you so much?
Do you know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He kicked me out of the house.
My shoes are wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you going to leave me?
You've always liked Tom.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, okay?
You wanted to ask me questions?
Don't make fun of Tom.
You'll land on your feet.

I'm nobody's enemy.
I forgot your number.
The two teams fought very hard.
I think there's a mistake in my account.
Tom didn't convince me.

You want me to be free?
What are you gonna do?
Tom seems tired, please take him home.
May all your desires come true!
He's already done it.
He's an expert with a word processor.
He was at the death gate.
You're hurt, aren't you?
Your table is ready.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?

Is this your umbrella?
I don't know three languages.
Tom declared bankruptcy.
We need to sleep.
We're in Calgary!

It is disease to be obsessed with victory, it is disease to be obsessed with the use of martial arts, and it is disease to be obsessed with presenting everything you have learned. It is disease to be obsessed with attack, and it is also disease to be obsessed with defense. It is also disease to be obsessed with getting rid of disease. To fix the mind obsessively on anything is considered disease.
