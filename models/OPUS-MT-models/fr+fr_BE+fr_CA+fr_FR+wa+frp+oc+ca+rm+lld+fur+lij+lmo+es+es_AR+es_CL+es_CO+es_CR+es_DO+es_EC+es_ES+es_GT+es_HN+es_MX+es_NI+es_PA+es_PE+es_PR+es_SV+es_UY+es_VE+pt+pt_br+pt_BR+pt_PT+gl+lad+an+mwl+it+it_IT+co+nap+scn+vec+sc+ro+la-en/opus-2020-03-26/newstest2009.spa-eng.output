The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions in the shares of ČEZ reached about half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of commercial Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday's fall when it fell to about 6%.
The drop this time is due to the fall of the shares on Wall Street.
This also expresses the market's reaction to the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives who refused to support the stabilization plan of the Secretary of the financial sector.
Fall of actions in Asia
The shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although throughout the day the index finally reduced some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index along its financial day marked almost four percent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that follows the Chinese stock movements in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the index secretary fell to 3.6 percent.
"The rescue actions programmed in the U.S. are insecure and this influences the financial market around the world," said Hong Kong Bureau of Currency Chief Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, i.e. without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
American legislators should reconvene as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bathroom of American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the plan to help the financial system to which $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns) should be devoted.
Legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American actions lived a bloody bath and mainly the rate of the actions picked up the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to almost seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index was already down before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal did not go ahead, the index began to fall freely.
Congress retreats: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
Your vote will take place early next week.
American legislators caused a gap in discussions on the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and be voted on.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday in the Assembly of Representatives.
He told Reuters, Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly, on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, "unhappiness" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms that will also be achieved in practice by market aid.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a great breakthrough.
We resolved our dissenting views on how the market stabilization package should be in place," said Democrat Nancy Pelosiá to Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a final form to the Government Fund.
It should buy from financial corporations unsold mortgages that lead to hard losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and will also have to be effective on the market.
We still need to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we're already on it," Paulson said.
A sign for Asian business
The global financial crisis has an explicit impact on the rapidly declining stock market.
According to the Democratic Senator for Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are doing their best to get Congress to finally approve an agreement this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' businesses about the Asian finance market as these are the ones in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday's trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote and not even if they will not stall at the last moment with any problem.
The legislators believe it will be adopted in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress could block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the program did not fulfil its function, which would be another $100 billion and later the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was retained, which was to earn financial resources for the purchase of bad mortgages whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
American President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's advance and that he values "the commitment of both parties to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armored contract
The president of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of negotiators, said that legislators decided on the responsibility of the program's money for the protection of taxpayers' taxes from their losses, an allusive closure of the planned finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armoured contracts for directors of the participating companies of the program, and set up a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We've worked very hard on it, and we've made a big move towards the convention that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also helps homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree to the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly charges of the debtors' instalments and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance's chief economist, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but rather difficult.
"And that is why it is not known with what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"More importantly, already this week the congressmen agree on their support and give him their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that this approval will be reached is, at the moment, the most important," Marek insisted.
Armed hand fight: MP3 Player against mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear that it's best to buy only the phone.
Still there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice depends practically on the way it is used and the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for you to acquire the most modern plaything to listen to in it the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP discs no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason for continuing to buy them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz or blues music are stuck in their shelves, he's probably dreaming, at least, of this type of play.
This is the same with the music that is on its way, that is, the compressed, simplified music - the music in MP3.
And here are categories of price and quality.
For some it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the market helmets from twenty crowns.
Two ends, among which there is enough space for each.
The choice is broad.
Also decides the battery life
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even what not even most mobiles do.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most basic functions such as calling, sending messages, playing music and video, recording both, having a better or worse camera and even being able to navigate.
And when we consider the Smartphone and the PDAs will have in their pocket also a small computer.
This is a small miracle since no fridge knows how to make a barbecue and no TV can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more the display indicator will be illuminated before you ask to be reloaded.
And music reproduction is one of the biggest energy tragons.
Few mobiles are able to play music for more than ten to twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) clearly have higher performance.
Therefore, take into account that cheap mobiles will not reproduce more than two hours.
If in addition to this, on top, they constantly call to get even more, for more security, a charger for work - this is also valid for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, as even the worst ones hold at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately only part of the devices has the universal USB connector and not all of them can connect directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only on some unreduced reader units can connect small memory cards that are used on mobiles.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music through the computer USB.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the music library according to the performer's name, album title, gender or also the user's rating.
Some devices show only a directory with tree structure similar to a Windows Searcher and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and will listen to it every day just a little bit, as in the tram, then you're enough with any mobile that you reproduce.
Which virtually really gets any mobile.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays the music.
The MP3 reproduces it all and, practically, almost all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most extensive and with the exception of it the absolute majority of devices play music in WMA format.
The least includes the AAC format (format used by Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough through the internet of the mobile phone to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and to purchase a song or album.
This service could itself be a weight argument for acquiring a mobile for music.
Unfortunately the offer of operators is miserable and most are limited only to the themes of fleeting success of the radios.
Prices aren't the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a cell phone on them.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find your mobile phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry with you headphones or, at least, handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile phone even if at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited to the absence of an entry for classic headphones.
The best, even with regard to the technical part, such as the phones equipped with a 3.5 mm entrance for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - really handles them anyone.
The minimal functions, their handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the playoffs are evident.
It does not pose a threat that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, huge account by data drop.
Which apparatus to decide by
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card you will reach the two thousand crowns.
Be careful, though.
The basic models are usually only equipped with a 2 GB card of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive ones have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) no more than 1,100 crowns are required.
If you consider yourself one of the most demanding music lovers take the hands of the most specialized mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman mobiles have almost identical use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over the four thousand crowns, but with a greater capacity of memory (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum yield of up to 35 hours), the brand mentioned most aria brings them players of MP3.
The first virtual operator is already arriving this year in the Czech Republic.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer almost all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not gonna be long.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it in mobile.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is among the most expensive in the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulating roaming rates it is likely to reach a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators the SMS that send them from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacks competition that you really want to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTU), Pavel Dvořák, has already said that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a sharp drop in prices to which classic operators had to react as well.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into Britain's market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for this type of operator and that they can succeed.
Otherwise, you don't have to look for examples too far away.
In February this year we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking there is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of concentrating on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order to be able to function effectively, they need many fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators usually profile with low costs - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that however, they often counteract with the supply of more adjusted services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half of the cheap compared to the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a good hit also the bet for a trivial nothing target group.
This operator specifically addresses man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - he is the operator that likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept as that of Poland could tie up in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover from the point of view of the provision of services is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic there will be any virtual operator that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region," he said in telephone conversation for mobile.cz, Jana Studničková, spokesman for the Penta financial group.
Indirectly he assured that the current mobile telephone operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step forward to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony services.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have made progress in the meetings," said the group spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe they'll spark better times.
It seems that, for unofficial information, the first official operator would likely have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we believe that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this field," he said for mobil.cz, Vlastimil Sršeÿ, spokesman for Telefónica O2.
Other operators refer to the specific nature of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokesman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional compliance with O2's opinion, adds: "To this day we have not recorded any viable commercial projects that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop."
He adds: "In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find a virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some specific contract that could be studied on such a short horizon."
Vodafone focuses rather on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this with regard to the sharing of costs and infrastructure.
Precisely, we consider it to be the biggest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on the mobile."
Responsible offices - with the operators nail and meat
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to lower prices and thus lower profits.
Then why facilitate entry into competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull from the same rope, proof of it is the grip when U:fon arose.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on the ČTU was at the time of U:fon's entry by T-Mobile society.
Public information accessible on the ČTÚ websites attests to this.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: "In addition, the competitive environment in the mobile phone market has not long been open to a fourth operator.
With regard to the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would mean for him and, above all, for his services great requirements."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging because of the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Licenses (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical position on this issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator was concluded.
To date, no agreements have been concluded since the offer of the potentials interested rather was not interesting enough for the classic operators", added our question Kristián Chalupa, of the UOHS Department of External Relations.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For the offices that must represent the interests of consumers, this is more than just a consideration, apart from that they must note that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the foreign country where virtual operators operate normally we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to the fall in prices of mobile phone services"
Clearly, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and the fall in prices does not fall within the interest of UOHS.
Indeed, the dramatic shock in all of this case lies in the dissonant reactions resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence, is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and of a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office in this regard has found no signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore do not have a corresponding increase of responsibility in their market performance.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunications regulators," he added to his Chalupa response.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is obviously an analysis of relevant markets developed by the ČTU that telecommunications is from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market naturally none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
However some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge is always necessary the agreement with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all its logic - has the monopoly of its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for UOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators are strikingly rising similarly.
The current complaints of the stakeholders (inluded by GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators they clash with many similar impediments.
Loading responsibility in the ČTú is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications of which the UOHS washes its hands in this whole matter.
We've met him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law was recently introduced to extend the competence of the ČTU in the field of commercial tenders that did not take place, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This must be perfectly known by UOHS representatives, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one looks
At the same time, something like a pseudovirtual operator that already exists in Czech mobile networks remains unnoticed.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services that, however, only a part are public.
These are usually multi-level marketing companies.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only some elected get the price list of these companies.
The magic is in which the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If cases such as those cited could be found to be in breach of the terms of the contract that could be translated at the end of the collaboration with the given society," answered the question about this problem Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that an activity of this kind carried out by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
It is precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned above that thousands of customers can become involved.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they gain nothing despicable and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a despicable so many percent of customers.
These, moreover, must accept that your phone's SIM card is not in your name so that they cannot absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of the operators."
Precisely this is what should seem to the minimally strange ČTU.
There is also a new question for UOHS.
If mobile phone operators turn their eyes on this type of procedure, why block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want to be satisfied with the operators' explanations that they have no idea of this history and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When we stop being the most expensive
As has already been clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market has led to a significant decrease in service prices.
At the same time, in virtually all the countries where the virtual operator emerged, classical operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this break-in.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases have defended operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure, the first virtual operator emerged and others began to emerge with it.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Authority this whole case happens as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot fail to impress that the confusion of powers in these cases suits them.
But let's not despair.
If this background information is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market is likely to start moving again.
If any of the operators lets any virtual mobile operator in, it will be difficult for UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of the Czech official celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one with a male voice and one with a female voice, another with a Choir and another instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are in charge of the song.
The authors of the anthem arrangements are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has already said before that it intentionally chose for the Solos singers with voices representatively young who are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with both of them and then, also, with the Choir that were fixed in the diction so that the text would be well understood, so that it would be aligned," he said.
The Czech official anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home sounded for the first time in 1834 on the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people made it theirs.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The MHD of Prague takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the Prague Transport Company's history describes the date when the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic ticket in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased right now by almost a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card at the infocentres and posts of the transport company at the stations of Metro, Muzeum, Městek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letñany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Bonuses can be purchased from yesterday on the Internet on the transport company's pages, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the Internet as a form of commerce can definitely start forgetting the ticket sales posts at the subway stations, where so far they should regularly queue up to take out a normal ticket.
The bonus is purchased online, and the Opencard card will be charged to you in one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is at the disposal of the passengers a window with prepared staff that helps interested people with the internet purchase and also with the charging of the voucher purchased on their card," said the project spokesman, Martin Opartrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to reload the electronic bonus on the Opencard in the vending machines that are located in some metro halls.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket picker and the travelers will probably have already fixed themselves on them at the stations of the metro of Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There is now in the city five but by the end of the year there would have to be eighty," Opatrný completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
In other words, on the surrounding trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the localities of Central Bohemia.
"In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the area of the bonus," explained the check of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that establishes the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
Circumval buses have their reading cards mounted in the driver's locker.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany it with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal completed.
Passengers who don't travel on the bypass buses and don't remember when the bonus ends can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
Southeasters wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
In 1945, the German Swedes called for Fumaba to be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, presumably, some groups of Germans from the Sudetes went to the US president in 1945.
It is from the letters that are stored in a particular archive and that today are stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American President that he not allow the return of the "land Šumava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want your word that the American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed with a "people who carry the fate of Šumava in their heart".
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the south-eastern Germans presumably presupposes - according to these the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors pray in the letter to the American President to assume for today and forever Šumava under a protectorate.
"We can't believe that without considering the opinion of four million people, it gives us a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that at all it collaborates with the victory of the allies," is written in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals by the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the U.S. presumably doubted this idea of the Germans šumavos, it would suffice to organize in the lands šumavas a referendum on whether their inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under their patronage.
Despite the fact that the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of post-war history, may sound a little childish to us, according to some specialists paints carefully the expectations of the Germans of the south-east of that time.
Although the Czech Germans had to understand minimally that they were going to deal with their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Swedes some clear form of autonomy.
Others believed they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
Even Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
He was in the war, as a German from Budějovice, wrapped in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war the British seized him and placed him in the prison camp of Holstein dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted that on the basis of the Benes Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could characterize the emotional Campaign that decided to launch on Wednesday the Ministry of Transport in the media.
The minister's office, Aleš İebíček promises to deter drivers of dangerous driving behaviours.
The 150 million campaign will be felt in television, radio, cinema, internet and brochures.
I'd have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol driving.
And also to remind them that before starting the belts are held.
He wants to become aware above all of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and, last but not least, of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that embitter emotions.
And to do this, the "bloody" ads attest to us throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "Don't think" is written with big letters on the plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that man at a time of dispatch can come to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to "get scared" of viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign on Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
Promises that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"For drivers, the sugar and whipping system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red light is passed and so saves time.
The whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says transport psychologist Na Homolce Hospital, Martin Kořán.
And that is why an information campaign is needed in the press and mainly negative publicity, concrete the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay any more attention," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the Provisional Government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke about the restitution of virtually all the occupied lands in 1967, that is, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will necessarily have to return almost all the land (occupied) if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll stay with some percent of these lands, but we'll have to give them a similar percent (from the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution he would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as he passed to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out in reference to the two July attacks in the city in which there were several dead and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the hill of the Temple, sacred and historical place" that is located inside the old city.
"Anyone who wants to maintain Israelite sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work," he insisted later.
Withdrawal of the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also entail concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to take off to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with Hizbulah (Chita movement), they will have to emerge from the permanent support caused by the terrorism of Hamas (Chita movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Post-accident questions: Are bus stewards illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the bus of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padova we ask whether the stewards and passengers can move by the bus during the trip.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the steward is opposed to the law of road transit," says the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old saffron died last week, evidently was caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place of the vehicle despite having reserved two other places.
However, the bus may have an accident or suddenly stop, and at the precise time when the saffron distributes coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with places on foot.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Student Agency's long distance buses do not have places to walk, which confirmed the company's director, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, this was withdrawn and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they own a seat," he told us his position.
The stewardess doesn't know the law
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the stewardess - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The law on road transport only knows the term of the Vehicle Reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined", adds, less sharply, the spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have places on foot.
That's all," he says.
Buses are divided among the urban ones, where there are places to be standing and of limited maximum speed, interurbans with places to be standing with higher speed and those of long distances without places to go standing, with higher speed permission and with seats equipped with seat belt.
As on the plane, says the expert
The expert from BESIP in Transport Safety, Jaroslav Hořín, does not see any major problems regarding the movement of saffron on the bus.
"During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared with the service on the planes.
Not even here are you sure that turbulence will come and that the saffron can be hit in the head."
"However, if the bus suddenly stops that physical laws are valid.
Same as on an urban bus or on the tram.
The safety of azafata must be resolved by the carrier's rules of procedure," he says, and he also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is not solved.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the saffron service.
He employs in it two hundred.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that work risky.
"However, at the time I have the impression that the saffron post is risky, then I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, upon entering.
It would save even expenses," he says.
In interest of safety is the reason why Asiana lacks azafatas in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We have no stewardess, we are against them from the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago to Týden.cz.
There's been a huge tragedy.
In the accident of the line joining Naples, a young stewardess of Pilsen died who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus without using the intermittents.
His driver tried a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, he clashed with the right front.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the saffron's rest were sold.
"These sites cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but waits for the financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Law reform?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring greater precision to the movement of the saffron on the bus in which thirty experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working for a year.
"However, they have not come to any concrete conclusions.
They are not too much dedicated to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile during the march," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards to be a major threat to passenger safety," said the spokesman, Hanzelka, "that the control of safety in buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf's hope rests in Frankfurt
In the letter from the West LB Bank Board of Directors for its employees, there is no shortage of big words.
By merging the Dusseldorf banking units with the DEKA bank it is possible to form 'a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group', as the paper says, published on Monday.
The West LB bank, breaking the `competition block' with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a start for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
This is how you understand the text, when a board wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because just like before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only from the part of the European Union, but also from the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services which recently made clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the part of Frankfurt, there has been much talk about the union of this type between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know about for their investment funds, and the West LB.
To tell the truth, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after a half year at the end of August let him know that he sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the DEKA board of directors, which is now composed of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, instructed the board to start negotiations with the West LB on common commercial activities.
In this it could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, so it is said on the financial site.
This is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the field of Sparkassen appears the name of the DEKA bank that with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003, at one point, the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
Just as the plans were made public, Hesse's government expressed itself against Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank began dialogue with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the Helaba Board of Directors, said he was against the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of that it seems to be more clear that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Well, when the Bavarian parliament elections are going to pass, the BayernLB union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For Helaba that does not necessarily result in good news.
If the pressure continues to merge will increase, Helaba will be short of partners to do that.
In the south, the bank could be just a young partner, although so far it was much better than the financial crisis that the buildings in Stuttgart and Munich did.
On the other hand the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided the plans of coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, only the North LB is left.
But such geostrategic reflections form only a part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband so far gave no answer.
In the end, the West LB can be broken down, but that, of course, is not the bank's own wish.
Thus, also in the letter of the board of directors of the bank it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the entire bank
As coexistence can be combined between singular parts of the bank and DEKA, that will show time.
Oktoberfest's second weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, he attends Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a barrel of 5 liters of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants that low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 there are three buses, ` direction Munich, the beer party', predictable arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
On one of the corners of the parking lot next to his flag are singing the South Americans, they had already started to party at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver patillas, belongs to these buses.
For five years they have come to Oktoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day on the meadow, at 22.30 the turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the law of purity of Bavaria, sickness insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
No beer, not yet.
Soon the tranquillity reigns on the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian registration take another break on the highway 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when Marco's group has the expected arrival at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow hat.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to the gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "knowsciviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the tent of the campaign open, that means march!", shouts Marco in the morning.
"March!" Walk and occupy the back places in the tent of the campaign.
"Do not take the front places, for we will block, and all with yellow hats do not sit in the same bench, spread throughout all space!"
One liter of beer, ruge Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
He just gets out of his place, he'll be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon exactly at ten and a half you have to get here!" Do you understand?
And now everyone's going to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties the yellow caps to the trees, traffic signals and even a sign of the elections of a great Bavarian People's Party.
You wish to be able to recognize the way back.
It's Oktoberfest's second weekend known as "Italian weekend"
There are no exact data on the number of people; these are 50,000 people who travel over the Alps and tormentively enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police are assisted by seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross that makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favorite shop of the Italian campaign is so called Hofbräuzelt.
Nights without sleep for the creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, federal finance minister Peter Steinbrück stressed only last week.
Well, let the politician use the word "relatively" and add that the German banking area will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich's real estate financier, who is listed on the DAX index, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to be able to withstand market turbulence.
On Monday a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to up to €35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to be of interest.
Money comes from private banks as well as public banks.
The cause of this is the loss of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was lent for long-term projects financed them only a short period - which is no longer possible because of market mistrust.
In the first half of the year the capital reserve of the cash bank has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of own capital has delayed a little from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, the continuous income from financial investments and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero, the debiting income for debtors and some securities also those from the dissolution of provisions of credit businesses tended to fall by more than 70 per cent, by 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and high revenues of the reimbursements of the expenses of compensation of the restructuring of the former group Depfa as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the federal code of taxes and the organized businesses for the companies of the consortium, the negative balance could charge a deficit with about 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state financier at first was lost in speculations with industrial credits for the properties, which served as reason for founding the Aareal bank.
Since much money could not be earned with the financing of State projects, the Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private and as well as state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make depreciations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the group's consolidated profit and loss account, it is said very imprecisely.
It's a fact that they've canceled the dividends.
By 2007 they were cancelled to two thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa the Hypo Real Estate became an important state financial and financial in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own customer deposits, it, compared with other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost EUR 50 billion to finance part of the Defa's credit portfolios of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the report of the Hypo Real Estate, the bank covers with credit the need for group funding for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of the international money markets that are now essentially unfit to operate"
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, president of the board of directors of the Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need monetary markets for predictable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services (BaFin) are on the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That has to wait for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there is no constancy.
It is even conceivable that funding will not be needed in its full volume.
But the opposite case cannot be excluded.
There was a voice that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost in insolvency, so temporary salvation cannot at least reassure worried people.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Borrowing courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts almost do not change, borrowing courses according to the position in the property register clearly tend to fall.
These are mainly loans from the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, with reason, loans whose maturity exceeds 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the present value of its borrowings that were formerly an investment for speculations must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the issuing banks, governments and banks that are unaffected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime it is possible to start with the amortization of pensions in time.
Or something will happen, which you don't risk imagining - the financial crisis will overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial statization, now the security that is already at its limit became a justified hope.
That's going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights without sleeping, breaking their heads about the decision on their isolation from enthusiasm.
Short-term investors can still put the end point and use the new-account transportation of losses for future benefit tax payments on change in the future.
Sylvana and the secrets of Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at the Tachibana Highschool, the girls started laughing: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was afraid.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I go on a 40-minute train to Tachibana Highschool.
I just had to find the way, lucky I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not as rigorously fixed as in my home, in Lower Saxony.
From eight o'clock in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
Furthermore, I am not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in the face of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt from my host family's mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I put on the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything in the right way: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this moment I was very happy because I had been studying this language for two years now.
All 31 girls in the class have stitched, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my Mangas.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "mom, cute"
Then I slipped quickly in my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong rang, I felt really mugged.
Everyone spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in the recreation everyone took out their Blessings.
My host family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring pieces of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something like tofu meat.
In most cases I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Things are weird and have a new taste.
What's certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of marinated plums in the salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools, benthics are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a beneth made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in hope of being able to know him better during a recreation.
That's what I read about in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?", my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
Finally for years I prefer to read Mangas.
To better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I'm going to travel there.
Also because I have a weakness for tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
Since everything is well organized, I still haven't felt lost here though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or cockroach feeling the danger flees, why is he also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can it be controlled if they, acting in a manner similar to us, feel the same?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years, the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or someone else being able to prove it so far, although we can't even prove that other people are conscious.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains present the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and generally about consciousness, we enter the unknown field because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as the other animals: the dead person is killed, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, so some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to spread our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include circuits associated with the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their participation in short memory and executive functions that lead behavior).
This large part is much more developed in the case of people than that of the other primates and seems to be lacking absolutely in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to suppose that even man differs from other primates.
Another particularity is found in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is linked with the language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case animals may be excluded.
But even though consciousness would not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as it may, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not allowed to be measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it allowed to be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the consenting experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal consciousness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during the short memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, the essential is rather the neutral correlations of consciousness than the causal mechanisms: both can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what does that result from for sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
From this point of view the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar in order to be able to describe the states of others along with ourselves.
For example Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations derive from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for body feelings and the brain stem, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but is more concentrated in the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I can't go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control whether rats and men acting in a similar way feel the same?
Seeing the danger, a cockroach runs away, because he's afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior still does not prove the similarity of experience.
That's true that neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, cockroaches on the contrary don't have at least one brain.
Is the brain trunk responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations supposedly differ fundamentally from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and tongue).
In any case, progress is expected here in the field of neurology while the same is measured for rats and men.
Since I don't investigate the tongue and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
One can say that I don't see beyond my noses, but I prefer to move forward than to work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the Deputy Prime Minister said that preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government looks at UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as the confidence test of Ukraine's ability to organize the European championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and in both countries there is much to do."
The timing of the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums is going to be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do jobs with great speed," said the president of a Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is not going to take our eyes off."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish PZPN association and replaced it by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslav Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN is not able to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured the president of UEFA Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs in the first division were condemned because of the downward manipulation to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid's outraged counterattack
She wanted to promote a new film, she talked in an interview about private life, and she has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The late war of the two roses in Meg Ryan's ex-partner and Dennis Quaid: eight years after his divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the disclosure of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard that Meg how many times tells the story of our relationship in another version," said the 54-year-old man to "New York Daily News".
Among other things, it's very "lamentable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again "will publicly remember pain and changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is remarried and recently is a twin daddy.
And so he ends his statements by highlighting: "Be as it may be, my life continues.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that's fine."
Prices of airline and hotel tickets are dropping
In the first half of 2008 plane tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year's.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany were cheap even up to 50 percent.
Air tickets and overnight stays at hotels were again cheap - this is the result of a study by the travel service provider and the financial services of American Express.
The company has analyzed its reservation data in the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found a big change in the second semester.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays at many sites became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased on average to 6.9 percent.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared last year.
The trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for this was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause of "the interests of American tourists in travelling diminished."
The decrease in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and thus hit a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, air ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Because of the rise in kerosene prices, passengers in the Economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-distance flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June the prices of airline tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany, price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9 per cent in the second half of the year, down to 23.6 per cent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of price change is on the one hand the increase of the weak economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the plane travel market the demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft traffic between the US and Europe.
The signal of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit distance flights in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankrupt - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
The HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him still does not go out to make the tenth goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the forced landing of the player of the national team Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed to make a goal.
Everything I meant exactly by reacting to what happened, I could read it clearly from his lips.
I just knew you were right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger whistled at the cabin entrance of the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time ended and most of the present were back in their places.
Rieger was almost for three decades a physiotherapist of the HSV, enjoys a great reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded with his head and raised his fingers in a sign of assent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the main coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that wasn't done.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," added Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) for its head impact; and also for the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
This Monday, the SV of Hamburg is going to be 121 years old.
On Saturday the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stadium and the table change on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," Marcell Jansen said.
It previews that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the sailing of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The quipo with its players forced late like Brazilians Neves and Silva, the winner Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to join, but still the quipo cannot shine with their successes.
"We need more feeling and dribble," says Jol.
After the vote defeat
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the bank's salvation package dropped the Down Jones to 700 points.
That was the loss of the biggest points for a day in its history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little bit.
About 20:30 one of the most important bag barometers in the world contributed a deficit of 5 percent in 10,579 units.
Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained at 1548 points.
Right now the biggest loser in Dow Jones was American Express who lost almost 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Goldmann Sachs' shares lost almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a large investor Warren Buffet had been financially involved in the company.
The plan of salvation envisages making available resources to purchase so called "podrid" mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid at once but step by step.
As compensation for this, the state has to receive the share option receipts for financial associations that during course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state cash.
Action courses in Europe and the US continue to fall
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not reassure investors.
The course of the actions of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is low and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the state-projected bailout of the financial market, the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculative actions of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the rescue actions of the federal government and private banks, the Munich estate financier's action a period of time lost two thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6000 points and accounted for a deficit of 3.7 percent in 5,839 units.
Throughout the world, financial markets suffered a fall.
The opening of the Wall Street Day in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion bailout package will not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The United States House of Representatives wanted to vote on the salvation project, the vote in the Senate may be the first of October.

Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused trouble for researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity cannot be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying into the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threatens to kill him in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver, causes confusion among the researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes while they get an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example from Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American spacecraft used this physical trick as did the Ulysses Sun probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: The missiles do not behave for 100 percent as expected according to the venerable law of gravity.
They're more frequent with speed irregularities.
The probes suddenly have a higher or lower speed.
The physicists could not explain this effect until now.
The anomaly was called during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity which describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, believes solemnly now as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what remained astronomers in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly can be the Dark Matter that can also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe have only known the existence of Dark Matter for ten years.
It supposedly possesses the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, above all also no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The kidnappers in the Sudan had demanded millions of ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The rescue negotiations have already begun.
The Germans always fall back to the kidnappers' point of attention.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE tells about the most important cases.
Apparently European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are freed.
About this the same information presents the Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After the news of the release at the Italian radio station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are freed.
'We now control his state of health,' Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and are in security, reports Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to the ransom," the guard said.
It was just about "receiving hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers on Sunday and two of them arrested in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany the ransom in the amount of six million euros; the money had to deliver the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to stay in custody until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take the position on this report.
Abuse of stepfather "has led to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by his stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stitians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assaults.
The Truro Royal Court, through an investigation study, knew that he had regularly tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court heard that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and blindfold her eyes before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, D.A. Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some of Mrs. Rande's friends had said about her, that after having been a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead," as if she had "renunciated life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that concludes by saying: "I used to tie her up and see her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends up with the victim taking her own life.
Even more clearly, it is that if she hadn't done so, the matter probably wouldn't have ended in the courts."
He added: "I have noticed the effect that, according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother, abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip by the Ministry of Defence, left two documents highly classified on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed on to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is probably the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention to commit a crime.
BBC Defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Judicial Service noted that the staff member must be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Service Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then moved from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face B&B price
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of more than £80,000 after the bailout/salvation of Bradford and Bingley.
Indeed, the Government provided 14 trillion pounds of sterling to protect deposits of 2.6 million bank savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies using the money of the savers, including 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humoring" that companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the 14 billion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest in the interim is assumed to be charged annually to the 700 financial companies with deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies were included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently ... are called to pay today the price of the institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is, each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and mediation companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450,000 in 2009.
This implies that companies will have to recover 81,000 pounds to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Construction Companies Trade Association, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those that were far less prudent."
According to the BSA, there are no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this issue in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a relevant price," said Mr. Cole.
Interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest payable, which may be almost twice as much.
Since construction societies are mutual organizations and there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interests in their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence per litre
The people on the Jersey stand will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence a liter from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and following the investigations carried out by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the higher price of milk had risen before February, it was in 2002.
Denied bail to former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the bail application for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
His defenders said that the court did not grant him bail by accusing him of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various allegations of corruption in his charge.
His long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's government, supported militarily, first grant him full freedom.
The correspondents say that while he was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what are the terms of his release or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail application for Sheikh Hasina arguing that she could not obtain bail because she was already in treatment abroad on probation," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"Let's file an appeal against the Supreme Court order."
Her advocates argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after October 17, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provisional government, backed by the army, assumed power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges against them.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan – the UN says – have not been able to take advantage of a recent anti-poliomyelitis vaccination campaign due to Taliban violence.
Last week the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said that it occurred despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or obstructed thousands of officials while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision that forced the company to reduce its participation in the rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Tribunal that it will have to reduce its participation by 17.9% in ITV below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission stated that BSkyB's interests impeded competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti Monopoly Office reported that the acquisition of ITV participation by BSkyB raised doubts about the independence of ITV, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin's boss, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the obligation to reduce its package on ITV was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly why, BSkyB said, it would have delivered its voting rights.
New investigation into the hiring of U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the performance of administrative officials.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators and former Produrador General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation have lied to investigators in an attempt to impede justice.
"Several allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," says Attorney General Glenn Bellas in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from office by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that lawyers had been fired for low performance.
But later it was learned that lawyers had not been assessed worse than other colleagues, and many observers concluded that dismissals would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of Republicans, high profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
and can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successive head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from dismissals, resigned his position.
A number of other Department of Justice officials did the same.
The Attorney General's report is very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the matter, and underlines how he had a "primary responsibility" for dismissals, which "abdicated" from his leadership position and was "notably non-cooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, Bush's former collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf of great honor
The rock star Meat Loaf is going to be honored at the Q Awards for its epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special award next week at the ceremony to be held in London, said that getting this recognition will be "an honor".
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group are taking the nominations for this year's awards and categorizing the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them. "
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal capacity such as that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the classification.
However, Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf remained about nine years in the classifications and came to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for his cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it appeared that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply serving.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-standing local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of the First Street – before I found the Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley more than one active road.
There's no sign.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on Primiera Calle
that wants to renovate Extra Place and create a clean corridor to shops and boutiques that is expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-time neighbors who commented they were delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remains of the block's past before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the City Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, which has control over the street, has no interest in possessing it.
At this month's meeting of the Land Use Benefit Community Committee, the representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, requested a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the Community n.3.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to possess Extra Place," said Ms.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some for use as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street came up for the first time during this month's meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, it didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a city's wish to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is to develop the property more than to manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided between his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, was opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps better known for the photograph of the establishment that comes out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the settlement of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, although modest, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, virtually unchanged, a strip of the city that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk in the history of the city about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and dead end, dark also for the day and marked by rusty and counter-window iron storage doors, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the canalons."
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stood close to the door that was used to enter the CBGB and that now hosts a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22-oz were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested that they could be cleaned up.
Mr Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its present state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in California studies and director of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Obama's campaign notes that "African Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "bilingual transition education" for English-Students.
However, the open question for Mr Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers instruction in languages other than English in class, is effective in nullifying the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low income:
More than a third of the students, many of whom have just arrived, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students, has been positively evaluated in the 2008 math exam
and almost an equally amazing 93 percent has mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved by using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama favored.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies and does not tolerate any excuses.
In addition, and here's where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the main one on Sixth Street, the school's approach to English instruction to students is in the "total immersion."
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Mrs Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "we have had extraordinary successes with students like this one who has arrived from Mexico and that if you enter the classroom 12 months later you would not be able to collect what was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating by other schools with large populations of Spanish-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of your party on the issue of education (the Associations for National Education have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their continued support for bilingual education obscures the prediction of Mr. Obama's response.
While it is that immigrants should learn English, recently Mr Obama has trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about the legislation that is only written in English
And instead, he said, "You must make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil prices fall sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil fell dramatically this Monday because of the concern that the American bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
Crude oil stocks decreased by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel earlier this month, before going back again, because of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety seized investors, once again, on Monday, despite the leaders of Congress who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process, confirms that Citigroup will purchase the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, as the government said this Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, on the frantic weekend, the negotiations that led to the rescue agreement "seem not to have been able to reactivate the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
"The prospects for global equity, interest and exchange rates are going to be increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape from this contagion.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the coming year, such as low oil consumption due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast to reduce the price of oil and gas is 20 per cent for 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
After spending, over the past eight seasons, more time than anyone in Jets' uniform, playing defense, Shaun Ellis thought I'd seen everything.
Then he saw how things developed on the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without annotation into a game of deflating.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazyly under the shadows of the clouds.
At this moment it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles performing a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect presage for an afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between the players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one of them when one cornerback fell and another came in with 10 seconds in half.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that were going to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were playing in the dam, the defense of the Cardinals abused quarterback Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to fail by Warner.
In the last turn, the faults forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked him 20 yards to win a final 34-0.
They're the biggest points the Jets ever made in a room.
To Team Coach Eric Mangini, ask him to describe the madness of this moment, he said: "The second quarter or the third quarter? "
When he was answered both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second quarter much more than the third quarter.
They've won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Rested Gebrselassie leads his world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated because many consider him the greatest runner in history, surpassing his own world record in the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running the race of 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the comfortable plain race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has destroyed his previous record of 2:04:26 for 27 seconds, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has established world record number 26 in a race of an impressive length so it has established a world championship or world record for any distance, from race counter-clock to marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would exacerbate his problems with asthma.
Instead, he scored to run in Berlin.
In virtually perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using an average of 4 minutes cutters 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered cramps in the calf two weeks earlier and that he had lost a week of training.
Clearly, the suspension left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything was fine."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticisms - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Afro-East rival - for the style of orchestrating his races too much, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on the pacemaker as if it were a race track, and putting the record ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's abilities as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after his pacemaker fell.
But shortly before three miles of the goal, Gebrselassie took a last impulse to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi reached third place at 2:07:48.
In the female career, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain has the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also didn't take part in the Beijing Games so it was described as a back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and set her best record staff in almost five minutes on the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculus race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to make head and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magrasa of Ethiopia won second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and proof of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the park to the theme of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet town, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated in the country and where Zora Neale Hurston's childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet camps, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not a prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem's Renaissance.
And, however, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, that "you know so little about us and that you don't know what's going on."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to starting a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told," said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the oldest church in the city.
"You have to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a level of poverty double the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the south black - sometimes despised, others praised - that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder those who live here are both proud and reserved.
A And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida often forgotten inside the history of blacks and human drama.
Faced with cement in both life and literature, Ms. Hurston took her readers to the Eatonville's first mayor's store, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road to the left," he wrote, "there is the modern public school brown with its white finishes, its well maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions the widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitory rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Ms. Hurston relates Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't do it.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls whom Mrs. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77 years old, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without notice in a great Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud to wear dignity.
Most of the residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcasticly.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," says Mr. Franklin.
But, he adds, swinging in his chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about it.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only colored woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no major memorial ceremonies, no major public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to set up a five-lane road across the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main street of the labour community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to it relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred to the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys, they went around the city throwing oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next door," said Mr. Franklin.
"They killed a girl, too, once.
They threw him at a car wash."
In a 1955 letter to Ms. Hurston, she wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court, which in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted instead of honoring my race."
R Residents today say that the disintegration of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - they used to hug the teacher in the morning and in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because it was white - there's a cultural gap there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who went over prejudices, just as she did, with buoyant, confident and lines like: "How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began to fight to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookstores, reintegrating her into the American canons.
The road project came right at the time Eatonville's most famous daughter was again under the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin on that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the five-way road would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride," said Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
People from outside town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Registry in 1998.
A new library (with the name Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006 on a repaved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like on a street in the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
The outsiders who come in search of Eatonville's history, its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A An advance permit is necessary to do most of the interviews, and some things - such as murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has weakness for the bright red, still fears that her island community may be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of Christmas pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the same way that Mrs Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, no better, no worse, and also the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's 18-year-old nephew, Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, in case they dare to go here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to anyone else'," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at your story, it's a very nice city."
This way, in New York, everybody talks about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the hurricane's eye.
They could never imagine that behind the glass façade of the bee nesting offices that are above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York face the worst "bad day of the office" every day since the fall of 1929.
Boys for home delivery continue to resonate their metal tea carts through the sidewalks and carry trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to drag between loaded apartment buildings, as well as human mules, with 50 eccentric stamping shirts hanging to a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their morning meal, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
The employees are still waiting to queue up their bagel to the sellers' carts, and yet it is impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon in the days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there are, I have decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the late afternoon calm in my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw his cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where customers of all life order their checkbooks, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy's large warehouses and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was informed later by Starr, my "trusted personal banker," and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places where they had switched them, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called savings associations (a little like a construction company), from the credit unions and savings banks in their hometown whose whites only function within the state of belonging, and who claim to treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, broke into bankruptcy, and as New Yorkers were heading to their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a ransom buyer.
The workers of the offices and shops that stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become experts in finance in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her distressed-looking executive director, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter familiarly as if they complained about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, fifty-five and some uniformed janitor from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping at the tent.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "now I have all my savings in money market funds.
Switching is done, I'm not taking any risks."
Desecrated Muslim tombs at the time Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far right party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgian, affiliated to the far right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signals representing mosques with a red line crossing.
The police are blaming extreme right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend as the extreme right-wing political parties made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Traun cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
Criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as David's Star on some of the graves, but investigators think that this may have happened by attempting to conceal the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was in some way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said that they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim religious when Ramadan was over.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that seized almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of its slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headbands and burkas, and also expressed opposition to foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties intend to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of sexual abuse of children, from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the supervisory authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a ban on travelling abroad last Thursday after the judges had produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by counsel Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, the police requested a disposition to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travels abroad as it did to France and Spain until March 25th.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad by virtue of being under the sex offender register.
He has to inform the authorities in case he wants to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent's police said they wouldn't discuss Glitter's individual case or possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do their utmost to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do their utmost to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risks that may exist to the public."
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11 years.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at the Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of Home Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I capture the master out of scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no flyers, no opening suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
Aside from the artist.
The other one, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments alien to the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a few hands, carefree because they will not go out to the scene.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different fields.
Included in the programming of the Flamenco Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people but, seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy on the stage... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With the taste of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1.997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material remember classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classical base of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of dancing, singing or touching itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essentials, with the leprechaun that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits displayed in the sample.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Veteran sportsmen's portraits" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to enter a moment in their lives, be it a long or short moment.
I think in the picture the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, you sometimes don't even know, or they leave you just a few minutes to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is shown at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 of the street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where you can visit until the next 16th of October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel she writes is "a fear"
It is set in places that it still doesn't know and deals with unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to taking forward the new project in which he works, a novel that has as its protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
He always favored the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him "is a fear" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If it were sensible, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days he has seen passing through the city of the Aqueduct to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was one of the prominent figures of the third edition of the word festival and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival Award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an ancient edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend", filled the stage of Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him an audience delivered to which he was very short the time at which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extreordinary adventure" of the "placer of reading" and "live more than he lived"; how he writes of "disciplined manner" to fill his "lack of inspiration" with intense documentation, correcting and reworking much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which their stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more inconsistent," so he asked writers "not to abandon themselves to frivolity" and "take responsibility" for their vocation.
Climatology misses the Pozoblanco fair that also goes without rejoins
The rejoining party that closed the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the announced rejoiners that the square floor was not in the best condition.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather has been sour with this fair, as two of its three celebrations have finally been unable to be held.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bullfight.
The cartel was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a prison in Castilblanco
So, only Friday was a celebration.
In him, the triumphant was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and went out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante came out with his two astados with greetings and an ear, which granted more the tendidos than his toreo.
That's right, even worse was El Juli, who went through the Llanos thing without sorrow or glory.
In his second bull, after a struggle of relief, a large part of the audience won a grudge.
They skip a control in Álava in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñon (Alava).
The agents give the two occupants of a van a stop and they start the flight.
Its load, more than two tons of hashish, was not like stopping.
The officers persecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A.A.J., according to a statement from the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several staff members of the Álava Traffic Unit carried out a transport check at the N-1, in their passage through the municipality of Armiñon.
They were willing to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, speeded up abruptly and skipped control.
The officers began their persecution until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later in the arena, when their two occupants acheed to flee the race through a forested area.
The Ertzainas finally reached out to one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they carried and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hash burdens, so they moved it to police units for thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials found that registration had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection in the van's documentation, and therefore the arrested person was also charged with a crime of forgery of public documents.
Ertzaintza continues to investigate the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape the race as has been said, and determine the source of the drug seized.
The detainee, A.A.J., 28 years old, was transferred to police units to carry out the relevant proceedings and will be brought to justice within the next few hours.
Arrested actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effects of some medicine
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medicine.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, according to People magazine, a spokesperson for the California Highway Patrol.
The witness has explained that about 4.30 p.m. Locklear "was stepping deep into the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot forward and backwards, and as he went back he passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently had not recognized the actress at first, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby highway and leaving the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned the emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, who was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "according to the officers at first sight, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medicine."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of a substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison at 1900 hours although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left a treatment clinic in Arizona where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Appelzares urges the Andalusian Federation of UI to assume its powers in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councillor of Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing preferential treatment to family members.
"I am a very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its powers," he said about the action that the party will have to adopt with which until now councillor in the Seville Consistory.
However, the leader of IU argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in the possible investigations into irregularities that Silva might have committed: "IU has always argued that this type of matter has the highest degree of transparency".
In the same line he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public positions".
May Blood, Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French in Blood of May, which is the most ambitious film in his film with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried "to illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide range of performers.
Blood of May, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, will be released this Friday in the cinematographic rooms, to become the future in a miniseries for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this film "a dream of childhood", which must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to film a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2, Madrid, which he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that has been provided in its entirety by the Community of Madrid constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set up with the decorated and the appropriate wardrobe the portrait of "an atolondrada Spain that was wrong to fight for, since the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having counted on a funding like that of Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice that of Blood of May-, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes framed in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost all his career.
Therefore, the director of Back to Start, has influenced in which is his usual form of work, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the shooting and to whom he does not cast, because he seems "humorous" and consider that "part of the director's work resides in going to the theater and to the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters who match in Blood of May repeat before their camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar on four occasions - of which he won one-, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, Seven French billiard tables and the finally selected, The blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one to be made known", he said.
With this film Garci does not expect prizes.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you settle for making one more movie," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Seville dancer Tortola Valencia
A Seville dancer is going to pay tribute to a Seville dancer too.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in the Europe between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I thought it was amazing."
According to the dancer, "we intend not to count his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks to me.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," she says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he did in the one of "The Open Door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whom his student was.
"Matilde makes Tortola the oldest, the character of maturity.
I am happy that I have accepted to act in my work and I am very honored for it."
The assembly also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas throughout its extension, and who are always in love with them".
The work also shows in some way the life of this woman who developed in places as far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, as she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think it is of those women who have a huge influence in a given time and now no one knows and much less values their work," says Bayón.
The show will begin today at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope Theatre in Vega.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Trienium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Council of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized in order to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That light cup", which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling through the various Andalusian provinces, is planned to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
In addition, the Council of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and of the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of malice", and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look, it cost them an Oscar.
And he's been retired since 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, it's been a blow to everyone.
"Sometimes what you feel is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of their existence."
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or overreacting.
A father of film and country had died at a particularly dark moment, fearing terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue the men and very few beings to admire you remain, there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for all an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and earned causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his firstborn who died of overdose to his home and organic food brand.
A whole gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of Hollywood barry admiration without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that a man had not died but an era.
Another Englishman, the oscarized director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was nothing more or less than the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"It has left the list very high for us all," noted George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping the demand for probity high and having a serious and remote private life from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But some try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once, but then he was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, to whom he was faithful when he was probably left with opportunities not to be.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger out of the house, if I have steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with their fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none of them were as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, lonely grandfather and dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect career of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that some Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012 may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race they called her, and in my opinion it was the worst race I've ever been in.
A pile of misconceptions that, of course, if they took it into account as an assessment and I would examine, would be a very clear suspense.
But let's go through parts and from the beginning.
The misappropriations begin with the collection of the back, which makes you have to go before.
Which doesn't sound bad to me, but if they already make you give it all (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the dorsal (first misfit, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprised!, there was only size 'S' for the T-shirt (second misfit, because I need an size XL)
What world do we live in?
Or have they decided to buy only small T-shirts with less fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a minute compared to the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the queue upon arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes waited, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as it was to be expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which gathered with conatos of popular rebellion and assault on the hut.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they won't even show up with the right time in the classification, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, didn't mark the exit correctly.
Of course, if they asked me about the perfect race, it wouldn't fit into my thoughts.
So I think we'll keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT's Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft has shown an advance in a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence without much intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company's campus) in response to what he hears in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the room, who are - even remember what they wear - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he's there to visit someone and tells him he'll be there soon.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week has been talked much above a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of loaded with commercial compass, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
A whole finding taking into account that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microshot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and also software.
When Google Chrome went to the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for Hardware and Software to be understood.
Do the same job as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear but one must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People increasingly pay less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer is booted only to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What is the use of half the applications that come into the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post I took in one of Microsoft's employees' rest rooms in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
In the soda machine a cartel asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not reach the beginning of 2009 but the end, rather by throwing at 2010.
In Microsoft they will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is every day more computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, will pass bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso was wearing it on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio was wearing a 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, the same as Al Pacino in 'The Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we start to list stellar apparitions, we can go back to the image of that pointed moustache forzudo that lifted weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it's just the typical men's underwear shirt in cotton, trimmed and without sleeves.
The 'tank', which call the English speakers, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles points out over all the others.
First of all, by its resounding name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - that has to do with sport because it receives its name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out over the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its top tanks.
Also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, navy T-shirts, babes, mini shorts...
Clothing designed for underwear comfort.
Although it's a shame to leave them as underwear.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Today the sisters Cruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they're a lot more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that Mango makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, wins in short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, as well as attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honour of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense but, at the same time, exciting journey.
What is your new collection for Mango based on in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the movies of the 1950s and 1960s; from there we draw many references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch women dress up like they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything unites and has many ties in common.
I liked my clothes since I was a little girl; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to sneak into my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of what I was wearing.
You know that dancers really like to make our stylisms for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the dress is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, that's right, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You haven't been in the 30s long, have you been in crisis?
What's up.
I feel better than ever, I like the 30s.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with less mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you're a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because the body asks me and, besides, I want to be a young mother; this I don't want to lose.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm gonna do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you're still looking forward to several premieres you shot last year.
That's right, and I want you to see the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless, everything I want for now and of course, can't be.
I want 'The Last Hour' and 'Looking for the Tomb of Christ' to be released.
Seeing how they look...
A few days ago you debuted on a walkway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I got up on a walkway to model.
Just called me Naomi Campbell, whom I've known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we exhibited - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - was auctioned to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm staying with that good part that she's involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he asks me to do the pin, so too.
For the benefit of women in the third world, whatever it takes.
Re-incident drivers due to alcoholemia should install the alcoholock
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholemia, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents booting the drunk vehicle, or if it doesn't blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the State Attorney General's Office, according to which it is a one-year pilot project.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver, so he will also receive a course of road re-education.
In the experience, in addition to the Attorney General of Segurida Vial, the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation for the Technological Institute for Car Safety (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving take the car back.
The alcoholock would avoid it as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in breathed air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow abs; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than the allowed.
Its cost is more than EUR 1,000 and would run on behalf of the sanction.
In this regard, a study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure relates to administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with such behaviour before it results in criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done on an ordinary basis, and yet the necessary reform through criminal law requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been piloted in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative by the PSOE in which it intends to install this system on school buses, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 1740, the time planned in the program, landed in the Presidential Hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to see the real couple descend from the plane.
On foot, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, then you won't be able to go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or so...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the journey.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence formed by 27 marine soldiers who interpret the saving of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the Princess, windy, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had told her that in the DF threatened storm.
They give a smile and a scuttle to the photographers before passing to the room where the official committee awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four big ones in the city, they are waiting for a reporter from the Mexican television station.
The best gifted award of fashion
Possibly there is no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, that Paris and possibly there is no living designer more exquisite and bont live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in Mango's window at number 54 of the Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and almost wept of emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, combined with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, caused us to finish at a luxury dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the closeness of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with his heart broken with sorrow and made with guts, for the recent death of his brother, put on a suit of the House and some ELAH dressings, which cut the breath, and his son Luis' arm - a canyon of almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentlemanly that he ended up, next to the baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the shop with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner she turned into a sexy black long dress, was excited when in the night walk by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a "great fold" hammock.
Inés Sastre did not stay on the walk through the palace's dependencies, but before he taught us on his son's mobile phone photos.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canyon that travels on a motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked, that there would be no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There is no 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And in case it was short, everyone is gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it's even worse to imagine being wrapped in the agitated rhythm that today's life imposes.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and disconnection problems with the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book an entire menu of possibilities adapted to each's taste and minutes.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores by the hand of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect the mind and focus on reading.
Talking Sleepy
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up very spatily telling us something that's happened the day before, but children who talk when they're asleep.
The first time it's happened, you're scared, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a benign alteration of sleep called sleepyloquies.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one people have been told he spoke at night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (once in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause to determine its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (to pee asleep) or sleepwalking, but it doesn't have to be like this.
As mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever patterns, stress situations or overexcitedness.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
I may speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or the opposite (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check whether there is any question that is generating much anxiety and gives him way out in this way.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, therefore it has no treatment, except that it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress box).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are scary or a little violent.
With very nervous children and who are very hard to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some internal calm.
This will help the child to have a calmer sleep.
Once the drowsiness appears, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what has happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not conscious, and you'll break his dream.
Even if he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes you should consult or find out what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common thing), do not fall into the temptation to interview him for information.
You won't get anything, because being asleep is not aware of how to organize your thinking.
Besides, you will hear what he says, but you don't know what he's dreaming of to say that, with which very carefully how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child you can question him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing wrong, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the path of victory in his field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having made a good match, the team created many chances of goal and was able to make a goal to win the match.
The rhythm was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to rub the squad with a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the "power" and by turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we didn't let the midfielder pass, and we just left Riahi in a position of attack.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two chances of Riahi and Temporale goal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, well located to collect the rejected ball in a first attempt of Diebold (53 ').
But the winner Illhousiens will not be able to taste much of his happiness and will be forced to return to the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in inferior numericality.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven Illhousiens who retreated a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a major butterfly, the ball passed very close to the cross field.
Sarkozy finds the fishermen furious
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a rodeo for Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance from the fishermen who strongly disrupted last Monday the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to find there his representatives.
They promised to welcome him " in a constructive spirit " and hope that " he will come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " Crisis Committee " set up by the Breton fishermen to achieve measures against the rise in oil prices, which marks a record in reaching €1.14 per litre.
According to Eliseo's spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses to return to competitiveness and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors. "
Fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy on foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce traffic in Morbihan and Calvados, which have thus caused congestion of almost 10 km.
Quiberon's marina has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
" A filter barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday burning, by scratching the dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the muds remained in the port, or in Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of the trading ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlántico region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until this Wednesday's meeting that will take place in the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not abandon " and " do not want to move to Paris, " said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, for example.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay fees on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached only with a diesel at a price of less than €0.30 per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two Men and One Destination " has died from cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the recession threats that weigh in the world economy.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 devices delivered, confirmed Embraer's president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would want to sell more than 15 % of its assets
The American International Group insurer, which has been driven out of trouble by the US monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets with the aim of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, this newspaper says.
AIG's board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine any sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to separate include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer, as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been made on these sales, pursues the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly conduct liquidity to repay its 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at risk of seeing the US authorities take 80 % of its capital, diluting it with the proper proportion among the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange charged a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, or a loss never seen in the Stock Exchange of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq lost 9.14 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial index fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past 17 September 2001, i.e. the day on which the exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, which is technologically dominant, dropped 199.61 points to 1.983.73 units and the index widened (extended) Standard & Poor's 500 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1.106.55 units, according to the final figures of the closure.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save banks that would have made it possible to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, the representatives denied the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the media he was asking for.
About two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
" That's not a good sign sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan, " said Lindsey Piegza of the FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market had to do with this plan," said Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted in several days would "be too late."
" If the project is really dying... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the American central bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions, " warned Brian Bethune, head of Global Insight's Economy and Finance.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, " every passing day the fall of a financial institution is announced " in the United States, said Ms. Piegza.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated dramatically, resulting in emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, showing that markets are facing "not just a crisis in the US but a global crisis, " added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen dramatically.
The yield of the 10-year treasury bond fell by 3,632 %, compared to 3,827 % on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond fell by 4,161 %, compared to 4,357 % on the day before.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
On Friday's first debate between the two candidates at the White House, another one happened to know who triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's, though honourable, performance was not "bright enough" to allow him to slow his down in the polls to five weeks from the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday, gives Obama five points of advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), believes that it was the Democrat who did well.
Among the undecided voters, who count, Obama won with 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them concede victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his member of his own candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
" It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts, " however, I warn Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, underlining the "ingenuity" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first caress.
" Senator Obama does not seem to understand that... " he accused several times.
" I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president, " he also said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without disconcerting himself, he was concise and accurate.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so, " replied, this weekend, a Democratic television advertising that reproached the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans. "
" During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a cold rain.
He did not pronounce the words "medium class" or "workers." "Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most capable character to save the economy that is at the edge of the precipice.
" Next week could be a decisive episode, " said Senator Charles Schumer, the influential and democrat.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster "is the end of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain. "
Reaffirming that it would, despite everything, reduce taxes by 95 per cent of Americans despite the outbursts of Wall Street, the Illinois Senator also noted that the realization of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a health and safety system.
McCain wants to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudents, both candidates evaded the issues related to the $700 billion financial rescue plan (470 billion euros) adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the election in Minsk? "
Young people and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislatures.
Hundreds of Belarusians met on Sunday afternoon from the closure of the electoral centres in Minsk Central Square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Lukashenko: "the dictator must resign. "
Some recognize that they have not voted: "Why, since they will do what they want with my vote, " says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that placed foreign observers in the interest of renewing contact with the European Union is prepared to make a democratic change.
Sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered to be fair to observers.
They weren't according to the opposition.
" We have been placed alongside the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of votes, " lamented Iuri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
" It's a cosmetic change," says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our home, it's the executive power.
If some members of the opposition enter parliament, they will have been appointed but not elected.
" But their entry into parliament can mean television appearances, meetings in the regions, and proposals for legislation. "
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, goes into crisis, and if we do not reform ourselves, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent. "
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that participation figures seemed too high, and that the spread of voting in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) favoured manipulation.
" Have you noticed the elections? Ask Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five members of the opposition to parliament, who are better suited to power. "
The silence of the night returns again to the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday its 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained the confidence of the public that had seriously been wavered by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for such a disaster not to recur.
While Judge Krever was late to present his relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau Committee carried out this mission.
As a result of the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of the people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, recalls Decary.
The situation was disappointing.
Having made a lot of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work during the years that followed, we have regained public confidence," he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population of Quebec now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Decary nevertheless recalls that "confidence is extremely fragile. "
Since its creation, on September 28, 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were witnessing in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Decary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
We then rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know it and when a serious illness can arise from it, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a brain degeneration that inevitably leads to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of those who had stayed more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
But a few years ago, it has been demonstrated beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied had meaning. "
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nucleid acid tests that allow for the direct detection of the presence of the virus in the donor's blood and not of antibodies to the virus, based on the tests used so far.
Nucleid acid tests allowed the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We could reduce this period by less than a week.
We therefore substantially reduce the risk that certain donors will be infected without knowing it and that we will not be able to detect them.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, one person every 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"That means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products each year, more than 24 years will pass before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I think you can now receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without worries," says the head of the management of Hema-Québec.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary says before stressing that in addition to safe supplies, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies.
" Needs increase because the population ages.
Since the most aggressive anticancer treatments, patients often need a red blood cell or platelet injection.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors that groups on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All people with good health, aged 18 and who meet the eligibility criteria, however, can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since the present life is very unbridled, we rarely find time to spend an hour donating his blood, " says Francine Decary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered as biomedical waste is filled with a blood rich in stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
" We celebrated a few weeks ago, putting on the bench our thousandth sample of blood from the umbilical cord and are expected to take out more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year, " says Dr. Décary, who describes this very popular cord blood collection program.
" Many mothers are disappointed to be unable to enjoy this, " since Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - Impact on the semifinals
The impact of Montreal was qualified for the semifinals of the elimination series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a victory for 3-1 (4-3 in short) at the cost of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the final quarter series, at the Saputo Stadium.
The centrocampist Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a goal anywhere, the midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many chances of goal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who knocked Matt Jordan down by the Sounders.
Let's remember that during the first match of the series of matches back and forth, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The impact will be measured at Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinal.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the back game to take it back by 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless accessed in the semifinals by 5-4.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief – Kovalev's winning goal
Canadian trio number one is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win at the free-range shooting in front of the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this gain, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory parties.
Kovalev won by scoring the only goal.
" I'm not ready yet, I warn the Russian.
" I need another game to feel comfortable. "
He tried to play to the fullest in the first time, wrote Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation. "
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude starting elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new minister of health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to make himself elected during today's partial election.
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern border ": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force staying on the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three immense screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large media like during the election period.
The Prime Minister thinks that the elections will take place this autumn, although he showed that his schedule was very full.
The "North Plan " is the fourth side of a "vision" that the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space, " which includes an agreement on labour with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel to immense potential " but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could be most developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, dominated by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond " , as listed by Mr. Charest.
This " twice - large territory like France " is our home, it is in Quebec.
Not only is he at home, but he is in us, " he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold riad in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, James Bay.
" It belongs to us, it is our future, " he added, after having taken a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all Governments reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I repeat that position on the part of the government, " he said.
Moreover, "with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North, " he said, speaking of the Northwest passage, which will open every year because of the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations, and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Member of the Quebec Party of Ungava), have already begun consultations around thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role started some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting in which " a common vision will be given " .
Northern development would be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan "will be agreed upon, ordered and environmentally friendly, " he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the former Liberal prime ministers.
" Like the Liberals who preceded us, we have been thinking in another way to transform the challenges into new growth and development opportunities. "
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival in the power of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes rebaptizing the Beauharnois Central in Embalse Adelard-Godbout.
" From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the Nationalization of Hydroelectricity, in Bourassa who made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future, " said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, prime minister from 1957 to 1963, called for another reference, that conservative.
Turning to the issue of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
" This remains between us, but I plan to be there, " he confided to his activists, raising applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that no elections would take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this autumn, which the law allows him.
He stressed that his schedule was nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York York Summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problems in accepting them: the Liberal Party of Quebec calls in particular for the recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcomed the broad lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Quebec Party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, coming to power in 2003, renounced its application.
If he had done so, "we would have made progress today" said Ms Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
" But what is desired is that this is not just a show, " commented leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonored country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) in Harper cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "sorry" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who waged an incessant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration for what she says all about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that were recriminated to him occurred.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing of the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and lets a child-soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who scorns false justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
We recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to benefit from an equitable process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: little does it care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exaggeration.
We still do not realize that, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when there is no more morality: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far wishes (what will happen after October 14th?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends the Virtue, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government renounced what made our country's reputation and dignity.
Mr. Toews, shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest gold company in the world has attempted a defamation process of six million euros against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate " .
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation persecutions, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his or her own?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers held by almost no funds pockets of the mining.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will dampen the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to examine the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in a number of countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by beatings.
It was sufficient for the mining to open its books, records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and support letters for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can request a "public" debate while ignoring his views?
According to the vice president, it seems that this word designates only highly paid lawyers and not for all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the audience that supports the authors and editors of Black Canada does it especially because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes of arguments, and not on what many people perceive as persecution-fatness (following the "public debate " , Barrick Gold has just filed a requirement with respect to the authors of Noir Canada by intimidating them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on freedom of university research and truth, essential for all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displeasure wealthy businesses in this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of many persecutions, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold truly wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he claims, he does not want to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months still needs to be confirmed by both Congress Chambers.
It provides in particular: better control by the elected ones of their implementation, new mechanisms that aim to ensure the reimbursement of the public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of houses loaded the lack of payment, as well as a right of control over wages paid to the leaders of the companies helped.
The American Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day marathon negotiations.
" We are making great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets, " said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
" Everything has been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street, " the Democrat explained.
" It's the fundamental point: if we don't do this, trauma, chaos and disruptions to the daily lives of Americans will be immense, " declared Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect of a further failure on the mood of investors.
The last hour that had been set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who were late in the negotiations, were more favourable to the agreement, but did not forget to express their discontent at being forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain arrangements to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow the owners to keep their home and the one on the salary of the leaders of the surviving companies by the state.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, they should not be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary, " he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, questioned in another channel to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: " I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it. "
" The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said that the option of doing nothing is not acceptable. "
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money the doubtful debts, the risky and unsold assets of the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the sinking of mortgage risk credits before extending to other more common forms of credit certificates (PCAAs) and triggering liquidity freezing and an unbundling of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have come out of the impasse since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of the companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the aim of smoothing the roughs for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision stipulating that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, it could impose new fees that would aim to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which another 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote from Congress.
In return for your help, Washington will get shares in the companies that will be worth dividends in case of profits and that will be able to resell when the storm is over.
The federal government will be able to delay the embargo procedures concerning housing obtained from real estate loans under this plan, as well as set limits on remuneration and on the compensation paid to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The plan's architects would like to see him put to the House of Representatives vote from today and to the Senate vote next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is still not sure that his plan will be adopted.
Some people continued to protest against this project yesterday, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the chamber finance commission, told his constituents that "with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand. "
" We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not that of taking advantage of taxpayers. "
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is an animator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems in another way, but comes to the same conclusion.
" Four hundred economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to tell us: we ask Congress not to rush and examine carefully the way forward, " he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had given up buying its bankrupt competitor since it lost EUR 2 billion ($2.9 billion) during the crisis of risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
" This is not lost money, " said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
Instead, we regained a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that savers and families now appreciate that times are uncertain. "
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and more than €41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is the one who would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bank Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
The American actor with a lovely smile had freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
Their modesty, their sensibility and a talent that was evident will also have removed it from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a big bottom runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, at 83, due to lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the past few years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom he looked a lot and who was long regarded as a rival in cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes children magnificent.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, as a German Jewish father and as a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No disproportionate ego, last brand of quality.
Because in it was projected a whole country in love with self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television and soon in cinema.
This man who militated for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, folded by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the show world that we don't know very well, also disappear with him.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death led to the vertigo of the filmmakers this weekend, while their great roles are intertwined on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual moving parades through it.
Many memories come back to memory as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on the adapted zinc roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoked your sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have moved on to film history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, a criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable at Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, repeated after his death, which truly launched Newman in 1956.
This cute mangant in the sumptuous film The Sting (El Golpe), Oscar to the best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), will repeat Martin Scorsese's character in The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar among nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him especially thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans again saw him in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as godfather of the Irish mafia on Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the rice was curated.
Contrary to several film legends who left the race pretty soon, Newman stayed a lot in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its stages and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, in humor, "as a challenge that lives in " underplaying " and that judges his performance too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young than marginal gallan: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose features reflected the rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed his true public sensibility not very well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
" Among the many tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former arms partner Robert Redford (they had worked together at The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: " My life and my country were better thanks to its existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legend career, he also hides a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a challenger against Hollywood excesses.
We have seen much of his face reign over the pots of vinegar sauce, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The profits of these sales were given to your Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than be content with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: " always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there. "
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What were they producing at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant harm, in a business manner, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Office of the Prosecutor, the funds obtained in public tenders were used for their own purposes, often justifying the performance of tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the municipalities - in their entirety about 65 million HUF - stopped in part in the treasury of the organization Fial Baloldal and in part in the pocket of private people.
The method, which was also made known by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the different associations never fulfilled their obligations assumed.
According to the prosecution, most bills were false.
For this they obtained the talonarios in the market of the District of Józsefváros and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made was decided among others on that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent to István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for a bill for his consumption and they served as a model for making the invoices they presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the City Council of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András İri, who, according to our information, wrote the reports necessary to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this food centre provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Eggiesület Association.
However - according to the center manager - so many people do not fit at the same time in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill consisted of one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of high-inventory invoices also overreacted when they pointed out to the food center Pigal Kft.For in the possession of books of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the manager of that company, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecution and showed him the invoices, he knew that they were fake documents.
"On the label the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal problems, he did not agree that according to the bill, 100 people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people fit.
In addition, the bill also included meals, while the restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The enthusiastic manufacturers of invoices were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest organizes exclusively trips abroad, so that in the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated as a service a journey within Hungary, which also did not coincide with the agency's billing practice.
Moreover - as was learned during the investigation - VAT was included in the document also, despite the fact that travel outside the territory of the European Union was tax-free.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért foundation, since the services of that company are not loaded with a 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, in addition the hotel employees only extended invoices made by machine however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "shippers" made other mistakes as well, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecution - does not carry out the company founded as investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false seal - it was known that the invoices issued to Egypt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, to XXI are false. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and to Biztos Pont.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehertó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue those invoices.
Nor did the counterfeiters pay attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation, that is why the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - refused to issue such a document.
They consciously expedited the invoices
Another group of fake invoice manufacturers are those who were aware that they should issue fictitious invoices.
The Fundación Esély Budapestért Alapitvány , at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
To the manager of Collab Kft. - according to the prosecution - he was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
In the same way he collaborated with Zuschlag and his accomplices the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 provided invoices worth approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jövőért Alapitvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület Association, without real economic activity behind.
There was no movement of capital either, as they then cancelled the invoices prepared but forgot to include this entity in their documents.
The next group of fake invoice manufacturers includes those who have some connection to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the defendant of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with fictitious headquarters in Budapest, who dealt with the trade in fuels and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately 18 million HUF in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that he issued on behalf of the company invoices for Atlasz, for Hoppa and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvany by charging the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian albañiles at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because - according to the defendant - they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, as at the request of his accomplice lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, sent invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations related to Zuschlag: for Atlasz and for Y-Generació.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor ' s Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the invoice amount.
This man even took advantage of the company in Szi-Beri command to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont competition.
Y-Generació and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországert presented a contest in January 2006 to Tancsics Mihály Alapitvany (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
From the contest they obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the contest.
For this not to be discovered, they presented to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Arpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will probably report in the trial - as they did in the prosecution - the course of forgery of invoices.
The most interesting thing will be the confession of the head defendant János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not so far done so.
The question is: what interest does it have in doing so? For perhaps in return for the return of most of the money - 50 million HUF - the Socialists have reached an agreement with him so that Zussi assumes all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since in order to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of much higher value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least wait in their own home for the sentence, he has no possibility for that.
Psychology of Overlays: Why do we spend more money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York discovered the neurological - economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to the study in Science magazine, people do not want to lose in skills like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in an auction and in the meantime was examined through the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI) the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could earn money, but during the auctions, where it is essential to bet more than the other, when losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-prime" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention in order not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, the economists of the scientific group also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
In addition to this, another group was promised that if they win, they would receive $15 more prize.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in the event of losing the auction, the members of the group even lost that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group playing "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previous economic theory.
For those so far explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation" - Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York's Faculty of Economics, established.
Hepatitis: When should you go to your doctor?
Around the world some 500 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated as many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms are very similar; liver and jaundice infection are characteristic, but their pathogens and diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses dependent on the pathogen are spread through two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body moods (sperm, vagina humor, saliva).
It is advisable for travellers to protect themselves by means of A and B vaccines, against C, there are no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A occur two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifest by a general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, the jaundice, the excrement becomes clear, the dark-colored urine and healing can last for even two to three weeks.
A million people die in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease every year in the world.
The main reason for this is that, according to the calculations, only one in ten infected patients receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can cause liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most people who are infected do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Therefore, premature recognition, systematic medical control, is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and those with tattoos.
There are currently some 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory control too, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptom.
The disease has healing if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so it can suppress the contagion and prevent cancer.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
Does it hurt less who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith had a calming effect that also alleviated the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
As part of this unique experiment, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shock, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanning technique, it could be verified that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first in the series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the various departments of the University also participate alongside academics.
The analysis was done as follows; they fixed a chipping instrument to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to fix their gaze in two paintings; the Virgin Mary, work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century and the Lady of the arm of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers had the hope that the Virgin Mary's spectacle would provoke a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had reassuring effect.
The patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts during that period while watching religious or other subject painting.
The Catholics claimed that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt "security" as "protected" people, "were reassured and peace reigned in their hearts."
When observing the religious theme picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such impacting image you can achieve a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, as by a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really change our personality" - Wright added.
After these wonderful results there is only one question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of her size?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On its tenth birthday, Google can state: it can be found both in people's pockets, as in the sky above their heads; it knows where their vacations have passed, what doctors they visit and what they are interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this isn't enough yet.
On the other hand, the skeptics that make a parallel with the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary in order to meet the original goals of Google's founders: "We gather in a system all the information of the world!".
According to Google's leader, the company even after ten years of work that revolutionized the World is still in the early stages of the effort to be able to process all the information.
To the question that what is going to happen in five years Schmidt answered like this: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would be best for me?" - however, the software will not be able to answer seemingly simple questions until there is enough information from users.
Not all netizens are aware that while browsing the Network, the search keywords, IP addresses and pages where they passed when the search was completed are accurately stored.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that started two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-consult what they were looking for before, what they opened up and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic the Recommendations will be based, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if you take advantage of my data against myself, if you collect information about my activities? - ask those users who worry about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is an already confirmed fact that they not only retain, but in justifiable cases also give to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of netizens.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify paedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens who are concerned about people's rights in May were relieved when the company together with EFF, an organisation for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated to the court that it was right in its dispute with the FBI: according to the judgment, Google cannot be forced, through any of the points of the constitution, to provide any kind of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to get under the pretext of strengthening the child protection law passed years ago, about 50 thousand Web addresses and about 1,000 wanted phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory to the opinion about Google: it is criticized by those who fear to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy, their privacy is impaired when they start using Google's services, and they rebel against it as against multinational conservative image companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users of other countries see in them the future generation, the "vanguard incorporation", not so to their rival, Microsoft, listed by its Windows as conqueror of the World, however much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the program package free, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because geeks see with precision the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that occurred precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measurements of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: showing ourselves.
A normal young person can have profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then they can be included in a tracking system such as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, can also have a blog, in which automatically appear the latest photo galleries that are stored in the Flickr or Picasa.
We can know many cases from which it appears that, for example, the bride, when she sees the flow of photographs the next morning of the common friends, finds out who she spent her fraudulent boyfriend with the night before or can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on her blog about the company's direction: one thing is certain, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
A person's "on line" life is what it shows of itself - this is the definition that hides behind the behavior of the youth of our day.
And the one who wants to hide something, or at least pretends to evade Google's monopoly, can do it (starting with, for example, the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but leaves no prints).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from being found, but Google's "on-line" apps can be replaced, from text-writing software to image and news-reading applications with alternative versions that do not connect with gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion awaits almost openly the day when Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of 156 billion dollars is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while the services that are introduced more and more rapidly cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also many other software developers.
Critic observers, however, will also find the contradictions alarming: for example, the senior management strongly rejected the employee's protest after doubling the price of the company's child care, considered too expensive the unlimited number of employees' feeding, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google yielded to pressure from the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement filtered all information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it is ready to function, if it is certain that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to revolutionize the World: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scan and archive project will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the U.S. Supreme Court, others fear their health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, will be able to provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, novel by Cory Doctorow's popular, describes in Orwelian form that future, in which a man only of Google's data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the fingerprints of the author of the double murder of the city of Ozd.
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ozd who, according to substantiated suspicion, helped to erase the traces of the crime - said the spokesman of the General Public Order Commissioner of Borsod Province on Tuesday.
Young women recognized the crime they were charged with, and are currently being charged with the crime.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency, they are two girls - will be free to defend themselves.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is charged with the crime of murdering several persons with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he quoted his creditor at the headquarters of a company in Ozd, where he killed him and then also killed the victim's 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI reports, the young man was prepared long before to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden in the crime scene.
The police analyze with an expert on the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - some five billion Czech kroner - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 per cent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which in a few months wishes to sell 60 per cent of the shares.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the offer of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, they have so far offered the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange stated last week that among the interested the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that, in the future, the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
The experts calculate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange by about 5 to 10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Investment Bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Bank Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday comments devoted to the ever-deepest international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 September".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - the Republic of Rome believes - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill made promptly, whose aim is to give a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", of which multimillionaire investor Warren Buffett spoke, it is more correct to talk about a "second September 11".
According to part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the view of The World, the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was the one that led the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing, and this will then have an impact on the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
You can't ignore this threat - says the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still throw life-saving belts at tumbler financial institutions, being able to save them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if as the dominoes collapse even more bank, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
It is necessary in the long term for the Member States of the European Union to put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received only more than €100 billion on Monday - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that concerns are becoming more and more real that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not been seriously concerned with the crisis that is going on as a commam for the Old Continent .
The "saviors" will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid a greater evil?
The smart car mimics the flight of the bunny
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not imitation of existing obstacles sensors in nature?
For example, that of the bumblebees.
In an amazing project presented at CETEC in Japan, the billboards gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the BR23C imitating car robotics management system of nature, to which they gave the characteristics of the billboards, with the ultimate objective of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
During the flight each bunny creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our protective safety capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of PR and development and research.
They play an important role the composite eyes of the eyelids that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of composite eyes, engineers used the laser-ray length measurement system.
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle microprocessor that immediately transforms into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the buffs, modifies the direction by turning the wheels to the necessary extent.
Unlike any current system, this maneuver is completely instinctive.
"If not, the vehicle robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the protective safety capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what an abbey does to avoid other abbeys.
This process must be carried out in an eye-opening and closing process.
However, unlike the abbeys, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonals, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the steering direction of the wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for the buffs to avoid other buffs, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotational movement and the acceleration in addition the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and its energy density is higher, meaning that they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, let alone the storage capacity.
This device in every second should only process some input signals and react as appropriate.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data from the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
No memories of gigabytes, no megabytes are needed.
This is the first step to develop technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which, according to Nissan's calculations, can be incorporated into the models manufactured in series within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding the obstacles existing on his way.
He's already got a name for this dear little boy.
The written version of the law of the $700 billion financial rescue package has been prepared and will be applied at various stages in order to buy bad loans from banks.
Half the money will be spent in the first phase.
According to Eastern Coast time during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, Congress leaders reached an agreement around the $700 billion financial rescue package in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have achieved significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American Congress, stating that the agreement is only to be formalized in a document.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the commitment stated: this program will work and be efficient but other measures are needed more. According to Pelosi, it's not about saving the Wall Street, it's about turning the economy cart around.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (i.e. before 2 p.m. on Monday, according to Central Europe time), without causing a spectacular jump in the bags.
On the draft law called the emergency law for economic stabilization of 2008, the first Monday will vote for the American Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House.
The program is different from the Bush administration's original proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy bad quality credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion will be spent, using 250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy securities of credit, bad ratings and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the President's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion could be spent after a new Congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously purchase bad loans, mortgages and credit fund securities, as well as other "venuous" credits as well.
The purchase can be made in auctions or directly - competent persons of the ministry reported.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated: the law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can even reach up to $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, to deal with the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could lead to the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks that are in distress and wait for state aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensations, which the American slang simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and limitations depend on the form of assistance of the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on the gold parachute, unless the failed head of the bank is jubilated.
By directly buying bad credits, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the chiefs' compensations are not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in American history that will be in force a legal limitation on the revenues of the Directors General - said the Democratic Barney Frank, president of the Congressional commission, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they will ultimately be able to obtain profits with the transaction as soon as the economy recovers and with it the bank.
According to the bill over the next five years, the president will have to present to Congress a proposal on how to return the losses of the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their reservations about the project.
This is not what the American citizens entrusted to us, that is, they are not protecting the taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Congressman of California, Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, said: the measures urged him the same ones who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Won't a visa be needed next year to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement to enter into force around 12 January - the Foreign Minister spoke of this in Chicago, before Hungarian residents there.
In his opinion, "it practically all depends on the timely construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic."
At the same time he warned that the new system will disappear the entrance fee, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin must register.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will be interviewed by the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, giving him the Middle Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and holding negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the bank's financial rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two great American parties assured on Sunday their support for the 700 million dollar bank aid program of the administration, instead there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon negotiations, on Sunday morning announced: an agreement of principle was reached on the bank's financial rescue package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and defrosting the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, in putting economic issues at the forefront, Obama regained some advantage and disappeared McCain's advantage that he had gained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy for vice-presidentship.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal included those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) is in jeopardy the employment, the savings of you in addition to whole industries and the stability of the whole economy" - he said before a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to describe McCain's economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain he explained that "everyone will swallow this hard (...) but not doing anything is simply not a viable way."
The Republican senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a monitoring commission for the Minister of Finance and the limitation of executive compensation, he insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, instead he consulted with the minister daily.
Congress President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that congressmen will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group themselves became the most conscious voters - says Der Spiegel on the weak electoral outcome of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a reddish coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" analyzes the motives for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polytologist, the Erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo had taken office.
Social Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are the ones who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process was completed that had been foreseen for almost ten years: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 percent, for the first time under 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the pace they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of education and the settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation also increases the possibilities and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group themselves became the most conscious, most critical and most stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in recent weeks it has been the conventional groups of the citizens who moved further away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, those who have high school and graduates.
Thus, support for the CSU was reduced to less than 40 per cent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper of Vienna: "Who with whom? In his article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved in matters of coalition" - deals with the confusing situation of internal politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, the green ones in return still do not want to consult on the coalition.
The elections were already held, now everything around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the party leaders barely allowed to see any of their barracks.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question that if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of ÖVP, in the post of Vice Chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to red offers.
He said that cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere in the ÖVP's internal affairs.
It is still open in the party if they will choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must certainly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
The President of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider, was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to assume the responsibility of the government," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities was launched in Paris, its host is France, which is also the President of the European Union this year.
Livia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to the segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that hit Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the rise of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights attended the meeting.
Járóka - according to the press bureau of the Fidesz group of deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Gypsies stay out of the labour market first because of their low level of schooling.
"Most Gypsy youth have not finished middle school and due to poor quality of basic education, only a negligible part can obtain university diploma."
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the establishment of other human rights as well.
Investment in early Roma children's education can strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
According to the Euro MP, there is a need to raise awareness of these issues widely among both Gypsies and non-gypsies.
For the sooner a Gypsy student begins school, the more possibilities he will have to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to a quality education and to ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education" – said Livia Járóka.
According to the Euro MP, the objective and active unit of the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of school segregation immediately, so it is of fundamental importance that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be complied with correctly.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Gypsy children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights," Járóka demanded.
The objective of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organised annually since last year's Berlin meeting in the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October a decision will be taken on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo
Despite the serious electoral defeat, no heads have yet been cut off at the peaks of the Bavarian CSU, the debate on personal issues has been postponed for the time being.
Erwin Huber, party president and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in office, but it is not known how long grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the party's extraordinary congress to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the so-called duo let us see: they do not cling so much to their positions.
They intended to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and of their basic organization, who, one day after the Bavarian tsunami, demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the Social Christian Union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they got only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the southern province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate, they will undoubtedly have to coalition with someone in the future.
As the first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's potential successors, also has a position in the small intelligence group that begins negotiations with the Liberal FDP and the Right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that on the list of the Free Electors enters the parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used for the coup of the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly erased from the stage to the ambitious local politics.
The CSU's top leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition he will receive an active role Stoiber also that until now he has been moving the strings in the background, the former provincial government chief and former CSU president qualified 28 September as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to be a chancellor if they are not able to enhance together the CSU that played a transcendental role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly conceal his disappointment at the failure, the losses of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great Berlin coalition.
Which of course is relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After the Sunday elections, there will be no opposition MPs in the Belarusian parliament.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that Alexandr Lukashenko guarantees in the country, instead according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral outcome.
Although the country's legislature of 10 million inhabitants, consisting of one hundred and ten deputies, more than a decade ago has no opposition, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time would "allow" the entry of some opposition deputies into parliament.
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that it originally wanted to make.
Against the background of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly dependent on Russia - which took credit to moderate the import of more and more expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, owner of the pipeline passing through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give entry permission to Lukashenko and other high-level politicians for having a political regime considered anti-democratic.
It was a sign of distension when the OSCE, in assessing the electoral campaign, put emphasis rather on positive phenomena and not on mistakes - such as the ban on participation imposed on one third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE Monday's primary report even criticized the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
With all this in the opposition's view, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has already considered the two regions to be independent for a month.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - declared our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime fears allowing even one opponent to enter that weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations when it sees the results, but rather tries to send the voters their message about the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties before their distribution, but even so I see that it is more and more those who support the change among the elderly also - Milinkevich said, referring to the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, does not consider it appropriate even the retirees, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the debt of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security that "looks like the silence of the cemeteries" - Milinkevich said.
The Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States declared to the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "people do not believe in words but in facts", so that the lack of opposition is nothing other than the testimony of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
but from today it starts with this measure against the person who records and then goes to the bar to have a coffee at work time.
This novelty has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors," says Brunetta, "are a tool for working better, with higher productivity, more presence and more services," says the minister.
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency is opening.
This is Reformism," Brunetta points out again.
With Chigi Palace the installation is completed in all buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from the symbolic point of view".
No resistance has been found on the part of the employees, says the secretary general: "It has been a change shared by the workers and there has been collaboration on the part of the workers".
In short, no more breakfast on working hours; no more coffee and half moons.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 am is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences of public employees' diseases have been reduced by 50%, meaning 60,000 more people to work in a year".
He added that it was necessary to make public administration more effective.
Italian, "which wage dynamics – the minister explains – in the last 8-10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and well above the inflation rate".
For now millions of public employees have joined forces to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
"While the minister of the Civil Service shows the numbers, the least absenteeism of work due to causes of disease – he writes the association of consumers – the people of the 'vago workers' is constantly increasing.
There are millions in Italy who are the right and productive civil servants who have joined in declaring war on the illegitimate norms of the decree."
In particular, the Tar replied to the exclusion of economic treatments added by illness due to service; the extension of the time lines in which medical check-ups were carried out by the sick employee, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid.
For 2007, the Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the gravity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and disabled by the work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "great appreciation for the continued associative commitment to workplace prevention, the protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and public awareness".
"It has manifested itself, a 'basta', sincerely shared, faced with tragedies that, by its dimensions, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is taken by the numerous initiatives promoted in school for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention of the phenomenon alive, not to slow down the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislation.
For his part, the president of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber has emphasized "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to put an urgent end".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not take away that the number of white deaths is equally impressive," said the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "trend to decline" to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that exploits the tragedy.
"We believe that at the general level too little is done to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our opinion - Mercandelli has emphasized - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school. "
"It serves a further effort - it has added - as regards communication and public awareness.
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced the "progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary guardianship envisaged for the victims of work" and the "assistance deviation towards which the system is moving in recent years".
"The aim is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance - it has added - because the fate of the accident does not have to depend on the gift prepared by the legislator each time."
Mp3 readers on charges, put the hearing at risk
Listening to high volume music for a long time using portable musical devices like Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
It is the European Commission's point that in a press release in Brussels it cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risk (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the apparatus at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and high-pitched cell phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific evidence – the EU's responsibility follows – there is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What counts is raising consumer awareness and making this information public.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and take the step with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the great use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that this gives rise to.
"Scientists - the EU executive concludes - confirm that it is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related devices."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as the auditory damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit these damage much by using solutions such as reducing levels and noise exposure time.
In its opinion, the Ue Scientific Committee points out that users of portable musical devices listen loudly (more than 89 decibels) to music for only 5 hours a week exceed the current maximum permitted noise limit at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno paves the way for the Commission for the future of capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the timetable set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the futute of the capital of Rome", which was established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Termas de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors closed in March, the council and the communal council will evaluate analysis and projects, in order to present in June the strategic plan for Rome with the "official ball" of the Municipality and its intendant Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to emphasize Alemanno – It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, will then be able to endorse themselves.
There is no leftover position of roles, only the will to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time-limit.
In June – the intendant announces – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
To whom the Commission accuses of being useless, given that its opinions are not binding, Alemanno answers: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always the policy is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that turn around manifest themselves..
On the contrary, we want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
The mayor of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a triviality: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to Roman citizens and it will serve to involve and reason the best minds expressed by the capital".
For Alemanno, indeed, "we need to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or motionless, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which we absolutely need, thinking in unitary spirit of its future".
A future that, the intendant of Rome needs" was not limited only to the current communal boundaries but looked beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and should develop as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that interests him as an independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and tube relations (as he also does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
a Miami lady has written on a Web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great face of stone: he believes he won the highest position of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!".
They are actually attacks that don't say much; they are clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And there are also polls; everyone says Obama won and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there is one who speaks to the heart but not to the brain.
A newspaper from the Mississippi, in the heart of the South of the United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote, we will know well who will vote for the American patriot.
One side of the American mindset is covered to the last.
"Say whatever you want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether about Obama or McCain."
Some people swear: if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They have asked 1500 people: what have been the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent have replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and kicked her home in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Similarly, Iraq for most has been Bush's weak spot.
Whoever takes up George W's position will have a huge duty to develop.
It uses, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "killer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been interviewed by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Today, though, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work for the newspaper is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is not wanted to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many views as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn of has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope "that it will do something good" for journalism.
The biggest break today in American journalism is between who runs the newspapers – i.e. the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
Fifty-six per cent of executives at the national level are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage falls to 23 per cent.
For some, this has to do with "work safety."
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
For the journalistic staff, it's 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet employers often offer what they want and thus becomes a question of "take it or leave it".
Directors almost always receive good wages, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, are "infirm" followed during the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: ROMA TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOLA STAY IN GROTTAFERRATE
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the field of research on the counter pact relating to the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the arrest process in charge, last week, he obtained home release, transforming it into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate to travel the city route of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (by which the pm has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million plan of salvation launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this one, more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save the economy.
It gives us a confirmation of yesterday's New York Times informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, always more divided among its old soul of the East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the states of Central and South.
The soul, in fact, that has become pre-powerful with the vow of the one who spoke at first.
This hardly mentioned is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here.
Whether in the United States or in Europe for a long time the crisis seems to function as an accelerator for incubation phenomena that with the new climate are solidified and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-updating, extraordinary reactivation, of the dual state-sovereignty category in relation to a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions - it would finance which, if they had strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all the balances of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or they don't have much to say: the crucial test is The European Union that divided as always between the different interests and the different state strategies cannot decide any common policy.
It is the government of each state that all are expected to intervene, rescue and reactivation plans, of new rules and above all the grant of funds: from the moment you get to court it is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market probably and no organization will ever be able to dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a factor closely related to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will have to make the accounts more and more with unmaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, look, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself as a sovereign, certainly possesses many more letters regarding who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a post without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that but presages a fracture.
Those who say Territory, State, Government, inevitably say Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take over the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing, economic-relevant leaderships inadequate with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in a growing number.
It seems to advance ever more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far booming, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the understanding exception of the end, to have made their own time and to be more alien to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a ramified but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and of the traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an electoral "return" or in the sudden changes of collective moods of these recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and layers also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do with it).
There is the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say any, make it ever more difficult to understand and then to represent, what since today is taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis is renewing, increasing and potentially agitating.
In the face of all this, talking about a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Win the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like the spider man.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has come close enough.
With a adhesive of only 2.5 square centimetres, scientists have been able to have glued a body of 100 kilos on a vertical wall.
THE STUDY – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the feet of geeks, covered with microscopic hairs that can assure the animal a perfect adhesion.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time "takes off easily from the walls" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton Faculty of Engineering.
TRAVEL BY PAREDES? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Can you walk through the walls exactly like the spider man? Can you, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use like the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat and electric current drivers.
Other applications may have to do with aerospace engineering.
For now, no superheroes.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - Also Berkeley University in California is dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of micro fibers like hair that self-clean from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, mainly consumed in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken simultaneously with some drugs your absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing as the case may be, efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packed that fresh associated with the taking of some medicines David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th National Meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying the beneficial effects and jeopardizing the health of patients.
The grapefruit juice was already under accusation because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicinal products.
PHARMACOS A RIESGOS – The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to pay attention to something they drink in case they are taking a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY THE POMELO – According to experts also orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan:"These discoveries in general are pointed out to the various agencies of the international and national drug that eventually try to change the information notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines that are taken, and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us impress, ask clearly to the doctor or the pharmacist" stressed the expert from the Ansa agency.
The Novel of Economy to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches Princeton University and is an editorialist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy decisions.
A few months after the attack on September 11, 2001, in those days that Enron broke, Krugman had foreseen in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that sparks much controversy and that for several years has been reproached to the economy, but that has now been revealed to be exact.
"I'm surprised and a little upset by how the memory of Enron's and Worldcom's collapse scandal quickly disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a divulgator with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical against the excesses of the liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, echo the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract ever more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work by volunteer developers, whose back is monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: the welcome screen and the less coarse magazine interface, add more consistent ones, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2 format,the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also given to multi-functioning with the 2007 Office Suite, Open Office is able to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interestingly some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphic development module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or text processor.
The Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English version that was in the mirror since Friday.
As well as for Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request can also be sent the installation cd to home or work.
And if the theme of free can be a hook for home outreach, it is in business that Open Office test the suite, tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects carried out in public administration and in schools.
And even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened, are not lacking.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the write video the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eats in the case of the known Access is the program that allows to work on the database; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that up to now we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case on the tour of France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third ranked and winner of the best climber wheel.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26 years old, is the fourth positive runner to the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
The tests of Kohl's blood champions are among those carried out in recent weeks in the laboratory of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-proofs confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positive doping to the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has declared to the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has placed himself on the podium behind the back of Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, awarding himself the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS:NEW YORK TIMES IS A QUESTION, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy's country of emigrant has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with hostility.
Is this transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? Is that what the New York Times is asking in a long article that has devoted to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case shows what the New York Times defines as the "north paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where they register "but integration and more work" but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment of the country and the highest support of the North League."
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also the new legislation desired by the League tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegals is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Trend marked by the Pope that by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has asked the State and the church to work together to combat racism".
Student victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for one room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, the tenant union, rent an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large proportion of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to bear – explains the head of the study office of the Sunia, Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong demand has totally distorted the market to such a point of triggering a process of generalized increase to the residents".
Apart from the fact that in most cases rent offers contain a number of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, no fee limit, sub-contracts linked.
For Sunia there is a need for extraordinary interventions which, through the tax review, can regulate prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Band Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for one bed in a double room and 370 to 500 euros for one individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked for approximately 600 euros for a single room and 450 euros for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
Economy is made only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for an individual room in Prenestina area, Centocelle and surrounding area.
In Naples for a bed you will be served 300/450 euros, for a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed you will get 250/350 euros, at least 350 euros for an individual.
In the cities, the prices are lower in absolute terms, but have a higher weight in the city's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and extra-Communitys is more frequent, there is a subsequent anomaly: an increase of 25/30 per cent of the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradise, the cities cancel historic halls
Historical cinemas close favoring the Multiplexs.
"A city without cinematographic rooms in a blind city, is like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the major Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticons on the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono-rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory, "it is as if a friend died, a acquaintance with whom was shared a piece of place and so much emotion", observes the director of the new cinema Paradise, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand jury prize to Cannes, which counted the poetry of a provincial cinema and the nostalgia for the way to live the cinema that perhaps lost forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of traders, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay most of them are the halls of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are as first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 less cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for his disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, are own these three Italian regions that have made record the largest number of new methic cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally" notes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the meticones.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To support the sector would be between 16 and 18 million euros a year".
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned with the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and protect the mono-sala cinema both in the historical center and in the periphery.
Among the rules provided for are tax facilitation measures for managers and public benefits in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will have special parking rates.
"It's an initiative I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is true, that in contrast to the extra power of meticones, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that was always important to me: the closure of Bagheria's cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to perform the "New Paradise cinema", which I had been thinking for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, in order not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side".
Link between politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the municipal elections for those interested in the Piromalli cosca."
The charges brought by the judges of the Calabrian Anti-Mafia Directorate to the head and deputy head of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the head of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by Mafia association, are heavy.
Also arrested Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already convicted by criminal association mafia and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Despite any legal and moral norms, and in good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with counsel Piromalli.
"The Mafia family – the judges write – would have been allowed to officially enter the interior of the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loirero does not hide that "agreements between the bad organized life there is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Andrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean'.
The arrested this morning are added to those of last July after the police had announced the head cut of the Mafia family Piromalli.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had dissolved, as early as 1991 and always because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, head of the Udc at the time of dissolution, after the ballet in May 2006, had been elected head of a right center coalition.
I exploit a scandal when the City Hall orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call into question the vice minister of the interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, standardizing the elections of the public administration on the interests of the Mafia families" emerges.
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage
It is an exterminated site that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now discovering it, the world's largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources over which the big ones look like Chevron.
The possibility of collecting energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell in 1980, the idea of taking advantage of marine energy was removed, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated for 2007 that 15 per cent of the global electrical need could be covered by implants that exploit the wave movement of the sea.
This amount would be twice as much as currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would also be currents and tides.
Giants to attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has signed an agreement to build an implant in Northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying technology on ocean energy – he has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the ha to the American oil coloso to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal – and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a rather important sign, if it is considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about technology at the beginning, because there is no doubt that marine energy has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts like those Portuguese or Scottish are small and do not seem to create great problems to the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a long scale, a technology with a greater environmental impact should be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good united between them.
The strength of the waves, which moves the good upwards and downwards, becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast via submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type under development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot, using submarine turbines on the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are tides, turns the pallets of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said that he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electrical Energy, deserves the potential of tides at this time.
While it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is above all about the energy of tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coast, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and an investment of 35 million is planned for 2009.
