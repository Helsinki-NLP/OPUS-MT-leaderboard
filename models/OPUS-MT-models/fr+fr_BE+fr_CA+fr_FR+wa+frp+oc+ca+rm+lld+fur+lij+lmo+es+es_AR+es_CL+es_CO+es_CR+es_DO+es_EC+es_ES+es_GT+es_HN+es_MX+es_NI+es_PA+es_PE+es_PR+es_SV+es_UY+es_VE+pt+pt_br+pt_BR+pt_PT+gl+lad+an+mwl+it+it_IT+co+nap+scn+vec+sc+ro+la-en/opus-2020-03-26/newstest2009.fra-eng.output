At the end of the trade, the Prague stock exchange bascula in the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with the shares ČEZ reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the trade, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed with its fall of the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan for the stabilization of the US financial sector, is also noticeable in our home.
Action crash in Asia
The Asian fellowships experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even if the clues were able, during the day, to erase some of the losses.
The Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost four percent during trade, but later it erased part of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the Chinese stock movement of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney stock market lost more than five per cent, but eventually the losses were reduced to 4.3 per cent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation about the rescue action in the US will affect the financial markets around the world," observes Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong have the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the financial system's support proposal.
Otherwise, other countries would be at risk for impact.
The bloodbath of American actions
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the financial system support project, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (nearly 12 billion Kč).
Legislators thus renegotiate the call for support for President Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
The American actions experienced, on Monday, a bloodbath and the main indices of actions experienced the greatest fall in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced a fall of such a magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress ceda: US government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial aid agreement to the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
U.S. legislators made a decisive turn in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns) granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not safe at all.
Indeed, before the final version of the law can be published and put to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Says Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, president of the Chamber's Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor in reinvigorating financial markets.
Given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "disillusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form that the package of measures for market stabilization should have," the Democrat Nancy Pelosi entrusted to the Bloomberg Agency.
According to her, the final vote could be taken on Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with US finance minister Henry Paulson, in order to give the bottom of the government a final form.
The latter should buy back from financial companies the unsaleable real estate assets that cause financial enterprises to suffer considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on declining stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are making sure that the Congress will reach a final agreement on Sunday.
They wish to calm investors before the beginning of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress' decision could affect Monday's trade.
For the moment, however, it is impossible to clarify with certainty when the two Chambers of the United States Congress will vote, or if the negotiations are not likely to remain blocked at the last moment by a particular problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will still have many amendments.
The total amount intended for use by the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be made available as soon as possible.
But if Congress feels that the program does not perform its function, it has the opportunity to block the remaining amount by two steps: first an additional $100 billion, then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed progress in the negotiations
Although the president can veto this decision, Congress has the opportunity to put the decision into a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the redemption of bad real estate securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chair Christopher Dodd, Chief Negotiator, said that legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the settlement agreement, the progress of the plan on the axis of time.
The new law also provides for the limitation of such golden parachutes for directors of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee to monitor the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides assistance for real estate owners, who have problems to pay for.
The government should negotiate new advances in the case of mortgages it will buy back, while reducing the monthly payments of the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
According to Patria Finance Chief Economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that it is not known what the mechanism and price of buy-back of problem assets will be.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," says Marek, this week, at the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is, according to Marek, not as important as that.
"It is much more important that congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that we will devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at the moment," Marek stressed.
A fight pushed to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear from this that it is better to buy only one phone.
However, there are sufficient reasons to obtain an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-end expensive gramophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disc, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there's vinyl discs stuck in your shelves, with rock art, jazz or blues, you're probably dreaming of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during movements, i.e. compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
There are also categories according to price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand kroner for a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have difficulty supporting earphones purchased for twenty kroner at the market.
These are two extremes, among which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also decisive
Some top-of-the-range music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are unknown functions, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Alongside the first functions, phone calls and SMS, it is able to read music and movies, record them, it has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, be used for navigation.
And if you consider Smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no frigidaire can grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of mobile is not without disadvantages.
The larger the number of functions you use, the smaller the interval between two recharges.
And the reading of music is one of the most important energy guilds.
There are few mobiles who are able to read music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the rudimentary ones) are significantly more effective.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you sometimes call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second recharge for work - this being valid even for the most expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are capable, following a recharge, of a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobiles.
As far as readers are concerned, you do not need, except for (iPod), any software.
Simply fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will themselves create a media library classified according to the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or then the user's judgment.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
In choosing a specific device, you are particularly interested in the lifespan of the accumulator, the capacity of memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of ordering.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading the MP3s.
Virtually all mobiles are capable of doing so today.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or reader is able to read.
Everyone gets to read the MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have exactly this format.
It is one of the most common formats, and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also read WMA format music.
The AAFC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of online music.
Simply visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding web pages of the operator (or those of another provider) and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to get a musical mobile.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and is, in most cases, limited to radio tubes quickly made.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether by GSM, Internet or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their furniture on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just need to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 drive at home.
However, it is also important if you always have headphones or handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use built-in speakers, which have almost all mobile phones, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical mobiles is their price.
Less expensive people normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, you can have a walkman already very suitable.
In most cases, however, you will be limited by the absence of an output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best equipped, also equipped with an entrance for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Really anyone can secure the command of the most rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the command to that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or of a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile Internet that is randomly connected, followed by an immense data transmission invoice.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
In principle, the basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones get out even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or a iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, choose more specialized mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and thus the ease of the control is closer to that of an independent MP3 drive.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the furthest in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a lifetime of the accumulator (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) above, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in Chechnya is relatively advanced, with our operators offering almost the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
Maybe he won't be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned on many occasions on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTÚ (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of a SMS was higher in our country than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming charges regulation, a paradoxical situation may occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of cheaper mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in Chechnya remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who repeatedly stated that in Chechnya there was no place for another operator, cried with the operators.
It is probably true that a classical operator with his own network is apparently no longer very lucky (by the way, now he would find only frequencies difficult).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable fall in prices, to which the traditional operators were then also to react.
However, even before the entrance of the riots such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the market, voices similar to those heard today at home were heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In only six months, this operator managed to win over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let's add that behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which has among other things the U:fon in Chechnya.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need much less customers than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In this way, in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in Britain at least twice as expensive as its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity shot.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work at home as well.
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesman for Vodafone, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services."
In Chechnya, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Chechnya, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in Chechnya the negotiations are not very encouraging.
Mobilking's launch will take place in other countries in our area," said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in Chechnya were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible to ensure that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of customers, has not for a long time hidden its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We very much want to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all the Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have made progress in the negotiations," said the spokesman for the Pavel Kaidl Group.
So the future may be promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that perhaps we could host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for the moment, its creation is accompanied by a total silence.
"At the moment, we do not consider that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific ones.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this field has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specific nature of the Czech market.
T-Mobile's spokesman Martina Kemrová stated in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project at the moment, which could serve as a basis."
She adds: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate in such a limited period of time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone instead directs his attention to the completion of the requests to obtain his own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický said: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This, in our view, means the most input from the clients' point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in their profit.
So what good is it to facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to agree to themselves as fair thieves. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also bears witness to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČTU, when the U:fon was created, was that exerted by T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by information available to the public from the ČTÚ web pages.
Today, however, the U:fon is ready to use as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "Competition on the mobile market has, moreover, recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and above all its services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, this is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in Chechnya.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, the latter takes its typical position in the face of this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the relevant virtual operator regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at this time, as the offer of potential stakeholders has a priori not shown sufficient interest for conventional operators," said Kristián Chalupa of the UOHS Department of External Relations in response to our question.
A statement thus formulated would not surprise the representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an Office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a declaration is more than confusing.
Especially since Kristián Chalupa adds: "At home, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services."
However, putting pressure on the honest functioning of the market and a fall in prices is apparently not one of the interests of UOHS.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if it really is a coincidence, arises naturally.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to chance and the hard fight of competition.
"The Office has not identified any signs of anticompetitive behaviour in this regard, so there is no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and therefore none has a corresponding increased responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably not even missing from the telecommunications regulator," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTÚ that telecommunications is, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position on such a market.
However, some law experts suggest another vision of things: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained at each time.
And the mobile operator has logically enough monopoly on his network.
Thus he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for UOHS that three mobile operators are visibly proceeding in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many stakeholders (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Resuming responsibility on the ČTÚ is a fairly common turn in communications, through which the UOHS washes its hands.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to introduce a new telecommunications law, recently adopted, to extend the powers of the ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised to improve the situation.
UOHS representatives must know that, but their interests seem to be elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work.
However, the operation of some sort of virtual pseudo-operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but the latter are only partially public.
In most cases, there are companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
For example, special mobile telephone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually reach only elected ones.
The magic tower consists in the fact that the company does in front of the operator is a classic company client, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she obtains special price offers (and others).
What is problematic is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you're talking about happens, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would examine and that could lead to a cessation of collaboration with the company in question," answered our question about this problem Martina Kemrová.
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such an activity would have reached the managers of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
An operator, however, does not rule against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these companies bring them non-negligible benefits, and at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary mobile operators' customers."
This is precisely what should seem strange at the ČTU.
In addition, another question is asked to UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the UOHS has relatively broad powers to be able to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a considerable fall in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators were trying, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were almost the same - a market too small or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It was precisely at this level that regulators in developed countries had intervened, not in the interests of mobile operators, but in the interests of their customers.
Both formal and informal measures have led to the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies deal with this issue in the manner of a hot potato that is removed by transmitting it to a nearby target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is in these cases more than profitable.
But let's not throw the handle after the banging.
If the sliding information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear at our home, the Czech mobile market may be back in motion.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS will hardly be able to remain impatient with the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Czech Citizenship Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde Domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with chorus and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the anthem's arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek regards Czech national singing as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously told Český rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose to interpret the solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to take care that both singers, as well as the choir, had a good diction, so that we could understand the words, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov mūj played for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the Theatre of the States) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse of the Saveters), an original Czech piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couplet naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The pragmatic public transport (MHD) will introduce, on Wednesday, the chip in their ticketing system
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be inscribed in the history of Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Agency for Transport) as the date on which the first passengers, instead of having a ticket in paper, will get an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, it is accessible for about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have it registered on their smart card at the Dopravní podnik (Transport Agency) information points and offices located at the Muzeum, Městek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letñany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons via internet on the Dopravní podnik web pages: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people benefited from the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can definitively forget the counters in the subway stations, where they had until now to trample impatience in long queues in order to obtain paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coupon online and will be recorded on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, there is a window available to passengers with trained staff, which will help interested people with the internet purchase and, in addition, will record the coupon they bought on their card," says the spokesman for the Martin Opartrný project.
Next to the libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the lobby of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminding the machines to compose tickets and the passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějoviká, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," Opatrný added.
An automaton will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card and the coupon previously purchased will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings of the city.
For example, in the peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the communes of the Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated in Pražská integreovana doprava (integrated transports from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of Filip Drápal tickets of the Ropid organization, which designs the timetables of the public transport pragulaires.
Peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's body.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger would need to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not take the peri-urban buses and will not remember the date when the coupon expires, can again join the vending machines, originally used to record the coupons on the card.
This is where, on the screen of the device, the information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Swedes were demanding a referendum in the USA
The Germans of the Sudeten asked in 1945 for Šumava to be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the South Bohemian).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, certain groups of Germans of the Sudeten allegedly addressed the president of the USA with such a desire.
This stems, among other things, from a preserved letter in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans from Český Krumlov ask in the letter the American president not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemian) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and want to be truly certain that the words proclaiming that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "People, to whom the fate of Šumava is dear."
Since the alliance with Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, attitude without regard, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take into his hands the protectorate of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would give this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and destroys minorities and that in no way has contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of a million inhabitants," is written in the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of the post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Germans of the Swedes of the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least imagine that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to gain some kind of autonomy for the Swedes.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as German of České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them the Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, following the Beneš Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Åebíček's office believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This campaign, costing 150 million, will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and alcohol in the steering wheel.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to reach the consciousness of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also bears witness to the "sanglant" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is inscribed in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a bloodthirsty, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
Which has to symbolize that life can be paid for a moment of carelessness.
The spots will "haunt" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen commonly with drastic images of accident victims.
It believes that this will lead to a decrease in the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whip against drivers
"What works with the drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time when they grill a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded of the drivers," says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
The signs indicating the danger to drivers are, in his view, already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will not notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert would return in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli Interim Government, spoke in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), even all," Olmert says on a daily basis.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), since otherwise, peace will not be done," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mount of the Temple, the sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
"Anyone who wishes to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he said later.
Retreat of Golan Heights
Olmert was also in favour of Israel's retreat from the Golan Heights, which he said was an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
That would also require some efforts from Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hizbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to give up their constant support to the terrorism of Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Kaïda (the terrorist network), and that of the Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus company Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can travel within the bus.
"If the law is to be strictly and formally respected, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Law on Road Traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus path.
The girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she has two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus can have an accident or even suddenly brake, also at the time when the steward serves coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is under its technical specification equipped with standing or not seats.
If this equipment for standing seats is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
Long distance buses Student Agency do not have standing seats; this was confirmed at Aktuálně.cz by the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"It's a matter we've been dealing with with with the ministry, and at first, it bans any movement of passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we got that passengers can go to the bathroom during the journey provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no single legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal requirement deals with this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement also prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The law on road transport knows only the term "vehicle receiver"; it does not define its rights and duties," adds the spokesman Hanzelka more ambiguously.
Josef Pokorný, director of the Road Traffic Department, believes, on the contrary, that the law deals with the problem sufficiently.
"It all depends on whether the bus has in its approval permission to offer standing seats.
Everything resides in it," he says.
The buses are divided into urban areas, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, long distance with standing places and a higher authorized speed and long distance buses without standing places with the highest permitted maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert in BESIP (road traffic safety) in safety in transport, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"When there is regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
Also there, it is not safe when turbulence occurs and the hostesse of the air can hit its head."
"But in the event that the coach would have stopped abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
The same way as in an urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards through internal requirements," he said and also felt that from the point of view of the law, the problem was not solved.
Jančura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer the services of stewards.
He hires two hundred of them.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their job a risky job.
"Nevertheless, as soon as I get the impression that this is a risky trade, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on board.
This would also reduce the cost," he says.
The safety concern is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles by the director of the Asiana Alexeï Litvine, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses, we've been opposing them since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end up in a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has arrived
A young hostess from the Plzeń region, who had been working for the company for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably took off the emergency stop tape without using a flashing device and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he frowned on his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but for the financial compensation, it will also rely on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in view
An amendment to the law, which has been being prepared for more than a year by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the travel of stewards on board the coach.
"But it did not come to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not interested too much in buses, but rather in the point system, at the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone by the steering wheel," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the activity of stewards as a thing that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," said the spokesman Hanzelka, stating that the control of the safety of buses is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfs rest on Frankfurt.
The key words were not lacking in the letter from the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf Financial Institute with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse Financial Group" could be formed, according to the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competence block" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive start towards other concentrations in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because WestLB, injured, is still under heavy pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Authority for the Supervision of Financial Services that has, only recently, made it clear to the Government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, for some time now - also on the side of Frankfurt - there has been some kind of relationship between Deka Bank, which knows Sparkasse's customers from their investment funds, and WestLB.
Certainly the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas announced in the presentation of the figures of the semester end of August that he did not see any meaning in the merger of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, whether it be the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Deka Board of Directors, each of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and savings banks, instructed the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it.
The talks, however, have only just begun, it is said in the financial place.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, together with its 3000 employees, counts for one of the largest employers in the financial place of Frankfurt, comes into play when it comes to consolidating the savings banks sector.
In 2003, it was believed for a moment that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Land Bank of Rhineland Palatinat and the Halbab.
But nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
The plans had hardly been made public by the government of the Land of Hesse against any participation of Hellaba in them.
Later, the other two houses also did not join.
The bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinat was attached to the bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the consolidation of the Deka-Bank with banks in Länder.
Finally, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had, however, spoken against any commercial strategy of merger with his bank.
Regardless of this, there seems to be a growing sense that the consolidation of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Parliament of the Land of Bavaria has passed, a BayernLB union with the Bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg could materialize in the first place.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure on new mergers is to increase, potential partners are gradually slipping away from it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far resisted the crisis better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hessen-Thuringe Savings and Transfers Group, which owns 85 percent of Helaba's capital, instead pulled a lock at the beginning of the year over any union with WestLB.
It'd hold the NordLB to the rigor.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can be combined.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely what business model the future capacity of the Länder banks should be ensured, had not been resolved so far by the German grouping of savings banks and transfers.
In the end, a WestLb dump could take place, which is obviously not wanted here.
This is also mentioned in the letter of the governing committee in place: in any event, a `global solution' would be included for the establishment.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies her as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a barrel of five liters of beer from the Kaiser brand, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 visitors to the beer party what deep sounds his taster can produce.
Elena first taps Luca, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta nova station, four buses take tonight the departure at 23:45, `destination Monaco, party of beer', expected arrival at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travelling exclusively from Brazil.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing gold and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with faux fur and glasses with large silver frames.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, three already fired just this year.
They go by night, stay for the day at the party, and come home at 10:30.
Spending the night would involve unnecessary expenses, explains Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a leader of the German speaking group - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses drive in the night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet in the bus, travellers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates take another break just before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at six thirty as planned on the parking lot near the Thérèse square, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, put on the little yellow cap.
Dessus is written on the left `Beer Day', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco `conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: `When the doors of the beer hat open, we run,' shouts Marco in the early morning.
Run! Run and reserve the seats at the bottom of the tent.
`Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we have to distribute them in the room!'
The chop, creates Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the instructions!
`Show the security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: `This evening, I came back here ten and a half hours ago!' Understood?
And that's it. We're going to the beer party.
On the way, someone ties yellow hats to trees to find the way, to the signs and even to an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer party, known as the 'week-end of the Italians'.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 who are on their way through the Alps and collapse in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come express from Italy this weekend.
The municipal police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which compiles statistics on the countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the brewery Hofbräu.
Insomnia nights for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisting on the Federal Minister of Finance only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used the word `relatively' and slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by crisis movements.
This has indeed happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), next to the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to protect themselves from market turbulence.
One person in confidence told Reuters on Monday that the aid appropriations were granted up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
Money comes from private banks as well as public banks.
In the background, Depfa's daughter-society supports the losses.
According to a newspaper article, the state financier had been refined in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which has not been possible since mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, while the equity rate had also slightly decreased from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
The current and net profits from financial transactions had fallen from the same period in the previous year to zero, the profits from the allocation of debt and fixed securities and the cancellation of provisions in credit transactions had fallen from more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only because of the significant profits from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as from the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the deficit in earnings of about 16 per cent has proved to be moderate.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier had initially mis speculated on real estate industrial credits, which had subsequently been affiliated with the Aareal bank.
Because conventional state financing was not sufficiently profitable, Depfa had then become more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private and state investors (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter-society, the Hypo Real Estate must carry out depreciations that should have on the calculation of the group's gains and losses an essential material effect that remains still quite blurred.
The fact is, the dividends were amputated.
Already for 2007, they had been truncated by two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been, since the acquisition of the Depfa, a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing in the interbank market since it does not have any customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks again rose considerably, with banks having accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs an annual part - about EUR 50 billion - of all the Depfa's loans of a short-term means of refinancing.
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the group's need for financing is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of the international financial markets largely out of the ordinary at present.
Other sources say the refinancing would be secured through the funds until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke explained, on the other hand, that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have to resort to medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for Financial Services Supervision (Bafin) assume that the capacity of the Hypo Real Group in the market is now assured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank only have to hope for it.
However, in view of the dynamics and immeasurability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unthinkable, however, that funding should not be used in all its scope.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest releases, still at the gates of insolvency on Sunday at the end of the evening, this temporary rescue will not succeed in reassuring the spirits either.
The course of the action fell from 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
The course of obligations, on the other hand, is particularly good.
While debts in the first place have barely moved, second-tier loans have declined.
The most affected are mainly the investment funds of the former daughter-society Württemberg Hypo and of course those that have a life span beyond 2009.
The obligations of the bank Hypo Real Estate seemed previously to be an investment of alternative speculation, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself that brought the crisis into the establishment by the buy-back of the bank Depfa.
As long as emission institutes, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, a resorption of the arrears can be assumed over time.
Or it will happen what no one dares to expect right now - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability of approaching certainty has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should reserve sleepless nights above all for long-term creditors to decide whether to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have learned from to constitute a deferral of losses over the next few years on the next automatically collected capital income tax on equity gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is due for the first day at the Tachibana Highschool, the girls start to laugh: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What was I excited about?
I was afraid of going to school already.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to the Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my way alone, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be as strict as we do in Lower Saxony.
Students appear after each other from eight hours, until at nine hours minus twenty, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the type to like talking in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue rising socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit, therefore, I presented myself in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low Masses, smelled of laughter and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him because of my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable for the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "sweet, sweet".
Then I quickly slipped in my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent should sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite calm, but when the gong resounded, I was attacked in the rules.
Everyone was talking to who was better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all took out their Bento.
My foster mother had also done this kind of Lunchbox to me - it's really something other than the miserable German en-cas.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat right here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
All right, except maybe the salty plums are jammed, brrrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento which she prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of getting a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read that in my manga.
I'm curious if I could look at it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always said:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
In the end, reading mangaes is what I've preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangaes and culture there, at one point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, us and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have sensations
A rat or a cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean he also feels scared?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same way when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, at least one can hope that all human brains present the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and approach the questions of the feeling or in general of consciousness, we will enter hard-to-practice terrain because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he does death, flees or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of brain structure make the transposition of our subjective experience to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be entirely absent in other beings.
All the less so for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from the other primates.
Another significant feature could be the linguistic nature of Man: a large part of his existence is related to language, which often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if the consciousness was not to depend on the language, it would surely influence it, so that the animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differentiate much from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, because of this particular Hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses major problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
We could examine the processes of animal consciousness without taking into account their content, and that is exactly what happened during studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what happens to emotions then?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we describe as "worse" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its sequences, such as the reactions of the body) grabs living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the cortex regions that characterize primates and especially man.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our voluble nature, are released, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others than to ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities are born in the regions of cortex and brain stem body sensation, as is Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could fully participate in transversal sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I can't contradict it, but I think it's indefatigable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in humans and rats is likely to be felt as such in both cases: how, however, can one verify whether rats and men feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach runs away from danger, but if he feels scared?
In my view, similar behaviours are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Of course, nerve comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, but cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem causing sensations?
And even if we could prove this to humans, how can we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, there is nervous progress as the same is measured in rats and humans.
Since I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, or sensations, I don't know if they exist.
We could judge this as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly hitting myself against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government considers UEFA's decision in Bordeaux to be evidence of confidence in Ukraine and in its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European championships," said Wasjunik.
"But it's not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to be done in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the deadline.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed," said Ukrainian League President Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA has always looked at us."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent director.
The committee had met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslav Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act in the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish PAP news agency.
"We assured in a letter to the UEFA President that preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League have already been sentenced, in the previous season, for mandatory relegation manipulation; ultimately, the beginning of the League even had to be postponed to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignant counter-attack
She wanted to do promotion for a new film, talked about her privacy in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan lifted the veil on her ex-adulterin Dennis Quaid.
He scums - and counterattacks.
A late Rose War for former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - in the sight and knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan had spoken in an interview with the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis was long unfaithful, and it was very painful."
She would have learned of the extent of deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - the story of an adultereress is told there.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his unfaithful husband's qualification was clear: it would be "monsterous," he said to the 54-year-old "New York Daily News", that "Meg retraces the history of our relationship and manipulates it".
It would be more "regrettable", that "the penalty and the disruptions of divorce for each child be revived in public" for their common 16-year-old son Jack."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So it was his answer to the scratch: "In any case, my life continues.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's doing the best."
Prices of airline tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
Flights and hotel nights would be profitable again - this is the result of a study by the American Express Financial Services and Travel Provider.
The company analysed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, established a sharp fall in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined still by an average of 6.9 per cent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than the previous year.
The trend was particularly clear in Paris and Rome, where travellers were expected to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low price of the dollar that led to a "descending travel of American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would be more affected by lower hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are held with an increase of 26.3 per cent, the record in Europe.
Also with regard to flight prices, the trend was increasing in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, economic class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, which were highly fuel-consuming, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, prices for economic class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in business class and in first class, however, price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would, on the one hand, be sluggish economic growth, the firm explains.
Demand would yield ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased pressure on competition by the Open Sky Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines of non-repayable journeys, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the top of the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find a functional eleven.
From Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player only returned late in the game and his raised shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hall of the halls of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn't much going on in the locker room, the half-time was over and most of them had sat down instead.
Rieger was for nearly three decades the physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received in strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and lifted his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and that jumps with this second goal!
We missed the practice.
"Everything wasn't very beautiful to see today," said Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would have "also been more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 in the middle), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful head strike by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not hurt the weak Hamburg players.
"It was a bad victory," said Marin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate its 121th birthday this Monday.
Already Saturday afternoon, the fans celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We can take a step back," said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the first League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals engaged - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen debauched from FC Bayern - is certainly slowly formed, but it still does not shine.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the vote failed
On Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan caused the Dow Jones temporarily to fall by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of history.
Later, the Dow Jones got a little caught up.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world's largest stock market index cost 10,579 points, with a decrease of 5 percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index was 1548 points with a decrease of more than seven points.
The most losers at Dow Jones were at that time American Express who lost almost 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could yield profits any more.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares accounted for a decline of almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, great investor Warren Buffet had joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of what is called spoiled mortgage paper.
However, the amount should not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged in conjunction with the course's evolution in order to reduce its burden on the Public Treasury.
The courses of the actions aspired in the whirlwind in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not alleviate investor concerns.
The course of action of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and draws the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones Index collapses despite the state's planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular decreases in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The action of the Bavarian real estate financier has lost three quarters of its value per moment despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank has suffered a decrease of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped sharply below the important psychological bar of the 6000 points and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Worldwide, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors were concerned that the US Government's heavy bailout plan of $700 billion could not be sufficient to restart the financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10.809.25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The United States House of Representatives intended to vote on the rescue plan, and the vote in the Senate should follow on October 1.
The other European exchanges also had only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index fell by 3.2 per cent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after an increase of 1.26 per cent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index dropped from 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 per cent, and closed to 12.595.75 points.
In MDAX, Arcandor's shares fell after the announcement of an increase in capital.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to 23 million new shares.
The multinational trade and tourism has also indicated that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the theft of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying into space.
Due to soon frozen fuel lines, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, by which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example, the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the solar probe Ulysses.
This has been surprising to researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave at 100% of the way it is expected according to the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities occur at the speed level.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists could not explain this effect.
They named him the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton Institute for Advanced Study always believes hard as iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support by using what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known the existence of black matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released as confirmed by the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-liberation shooting, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for ransom would already be under way.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnapper collimator.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This was communicated jointly by Egyptian state television, Arab television channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
The Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We're checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians, as well as their eight Egyptian escorts, are doing well and safe, announced Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the desert tour should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting prior to the release of the hostages remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the agent.
All that remained was to collect the hostages", when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers killed six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German woman from one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men had to be held until the kidnappers found a safe route to flee.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this account.
Abuse of a stepfather" who led to suicide"
A court was informed that years of abuse by his father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stitians, in Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent assault.
Truro's trial court stated that he regularly linked his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death".
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34 years of age, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and taped her before forcing her to sexual acts, while her mother worked at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law left for Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a volunteer assistant at National Trust, was haunted by the abuses inflicted on her twice a week.
The Attorney General, Ramsey Quaife, told the court that friends had reported that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had appeared since 2006 "emotionally dead", and "lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr.Randle faced his daughter's beautiful father, who had also written a letter of confession, which ended in this way: "I attacked her and banded her regularly".
"I haven't abused her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Justice Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are really strange as a fetishist, your victim must certainly be terrified, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is the fact that if she hadn't done that, her story would certainly never be over in court."
He added: "In particular, as his father and mother describe, I stress the effects of your crime on Stephanie for years.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, successful young woman today."
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office ministerial officer who had forgotten top-secret documents in June on a train will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train heading for Waterloo.
The documents were passed into the BBC's hands before being delivered to the police.
This is the least serious conviction of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They will have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed is charged with a violation of Section 8.1 of the Act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Building companies against invoice B&B.
British construction companies may have to pay a bill of over £80 million to cover the bailout of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savers.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that raise money from the savers, including 59 construction companies.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay for broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interest that will increase at the same time, will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that harvest the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have had prudent behaviour... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is stated that each company must pay an amount proportional to the deposits it holds, and that the intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be £450million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Building Companies Trade Committee, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have behaved cautiously during the resumption of the real estate market must now pay for institutions much less cautiously.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first years.
"We need to examine all aspects of this case in the coming weeks, to assess the options to be adopted in order to prevent the construction companies and their members from paying this salty bill," said Cole.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the entire year, which could indeed double.
Since the building companies are non-shareholder organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases to five penny per litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that it would increase the wholesale price of its milk, from five penny per litre, starting Monday.
This is the second increase in the price that follows a two-penny increase in February, and occurs as a result of a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers need to decide whether to go in turn, increase the price to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk had been varied for the last time in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh was denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a bail application to former PM Sheikh Hasina, who was thus in danger of being arrested upon his return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him his bail because of his questioning for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000.00) when she was a PM.
This case is one of the many allegations addressed to him.
Khaleda Zia, the rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, demanded that the country's provisional military government first give him full freedom.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of her release were contradictory because if she was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court's order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she not require bail as she had been allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December
Sheikh Hasina is due to return after October 17, said a former leader of the Awami party.
She was detained last year after the military interim government assumed power, but was released in June to take care of herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina like Zhaleda Zia, deny the charges against them.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-poly campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign because of Taliban-related violence, the United Nations said.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
But she says she can't reach the children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located south.
A United Nations spokesman said that this occurred despite Taliban promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV's judicial battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the Competition Commission's verdict, which would oblige BSkyB to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to influence unfairly ITV.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement to effectively prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV's shares sowed doubts about the effective independence of ITV, thereby inciting the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and the Ofcom regulator were all against this purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV shares would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just waived its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special accuser to verify the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole was born out of the record of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officers, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
The Special Accusor, Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, thereby obstructing justice.
"Serious accusations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the elimination in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors from the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were dismissed for poor benefits.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to attribute a political connotation to these dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to Congressional Republicans, while others reportedly refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting the courts for the government.
It is certain that they may be dismissed at any time, but cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ends up being accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers from the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these dismissals, and ended up "abdicating" his role as leader," remarkably succeeding in not getting involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush's former collaborator Karl Rove, were critical of the failure to cooperate during the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf will have to be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honoured at the Q Awards for its epic Bat Out Of Hell song.
The singer, who will receive an oscar at the ceremony in London next week, declared to be "honored" to obtain this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the hit of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The evening of the award is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a selection limited to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly part of it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was placed in commerce in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, ranking in the fifteenth place.
In addition, his Bat Out of Hell album remained nine years in the English rankings, and was sold to over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of her real name- has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to heal her a heart beat that became irregular, after she collapsed on stage, in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then we found him a cyst in the vocal cords.
A Sombre Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and Can Be Soon for Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-standing local residents do not know how to give instructions to go to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to restore Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-standing neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the house block.
But the City's Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development, which manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the neighbourhood owners' committees, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal allowing the real estate manufacturer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee #3.
"There are only a few spaces left that belong to the city, and we would like the city to conserve Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to restore it and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to renovate the small street and install seats there, some of which would be used by a café to which the builder would grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesman, said that although the company wants to operate the street, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relooker this abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city that suggested the sale to him."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of Real Estate, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, stressing further that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named since 1802, when the inheritance of the great farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since been abandoned.
The subsequent entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' album Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scraps, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already spoken about the evolution towards the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarity - a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be ruined in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Answers: A Nostalgic Amerament Look at a City in the Extinction Process"), reports the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small, dark day-to-night, narrow ass-of-sac, and delimited by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and parsleys, full of newspapers from last week flying along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs agilely at the bottom of the alley, near a door that once led to CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a fancy clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce beer bottle, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
Some passers-by said they only rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some people were underestimating the appeal of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have taken place in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The Bilingual debate: Immersion in the English language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidate's position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of California studies, and former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Thought. Why the middle classes should be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favours of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama's campaign emphasizes that "African American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students." That's a true fact.
To combat these differences, Obama's education program supports, in particular, among many other topics, "Bilingual Transitional Education" for those learning English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends language class education other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are mostly Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, consisting of many newcomers, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 state math exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English-language-of-art exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than that advanced by Obama.
Sixth Street puts on analyses, practice, a constant assessment of capabilities and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here's an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, chief of Sixth Street, this school introduced the English language instruction "full immersion".
The total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, said to me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without her class, you would have had no chance to identify her."
"It works," she observes, "it worked for us."
Obama should not take an example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results obtained by this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the prognosis of Obama's response.
Although he was in favour of immigrants learning English, Obama had recently considered this issue as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop arguing about the wording of English-language laws.
" On the contrary, he said, "you must make sure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than demeaning them or considering them as insignificant.
Net Oil Fall Following New World Economic Concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, as people fear that the bailout plan for financial marches will not bring the economy back to life.
The final operations of crude oil, fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. The New York Stock Exchange, during this morning's sales.
Prices have dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After having experienced an increase of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices dropped to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in view of the deep uncertainties in the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again concerned despite the agreement on the rescue plan, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news was alleviated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the very last episode of this financial disaster, "Citygroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation," the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts have stated that this weekend's frantic negotiations with the rescue agreement" seem to have failed to revive the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"the outlook for global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain," wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a letter to their investors."
"we believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular in China."
The bank's analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, they were therefore forced to decrease by 20 percent, the oil and gas price forecasts for 2009.
The Determinant Second Time Day for Team Record Improvement.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the uniform of the Shaun Ellis Jets, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He was looking at the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," Ellis said.
The second phase began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor sign of an after noon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for another two touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from the middle.
"I didn't get out of my area" Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"he's a poor player"
"We communicated extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense beat the Cardinals' quarter back, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of Bowens' ball, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best that the Jets could score in a while.
"The coach of the Jets, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "the second time or the third?"
When the two Jets were told to pass 21 undisputed points in the third time, Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third time.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, surpassed his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, again proved worthy of his title as the best background runner of the century, after beating his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2:03:59 of an accomodating race on the plate, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his great career during which he won the world championship or world record for any distance, from the 1600 meter marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps exaggerated in today's eyes - that air pollution does not increase his asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run in Berlin.
Under almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the finish- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background runners, have contributed to the decline of the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered from cramps in the calf two weeks before, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to stay brilliant, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
" Everything was perfect.
I got back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but at the end, everything went for the best."
He was accused, especially in Kenya, of having too many races in Ethiopia, by avoiding the world's marathon stars, counting in fact on the hare as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the meaning of the competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the magnitude of Gebrselasie's abilities as a background runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. halfway.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the leaders disappeared.
A little over three miles from the finish line, Gebrselassie made his final climb to break off from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Englishman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing games because of a bad back hypothesis, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran through a skillful strategy, allowing the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan riders to take a good advantage, then surpassing them about 18 thousand 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, finished third at 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, the Pride and the Tests of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, is a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first fully black city to be integrated, the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make nowadays." The city at five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
It has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival, which is held every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she describes- has become a tourist thanks to her inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression-Era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was already in the 1930s, when Hurston reported that Florida's black rural population was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little about us, doesn't know what he's missing."
Although this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also called for an open dialogue on the issue of race, many here remain cautious of the eyes of foreigners.
"we are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59, a long-time resident and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"it needs to be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of black empowerment and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point, but also an example of a black southern rural culture - a few times disillusioned, sometimes hailed - that recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in Eatonville's image born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere, dialectical books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, just outside Route 17, a road that crosses the center of Florida, often forgotten, which culminates in the chapter of black history and human drama.
Audacious as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was then divided into several private parts.
"After crossing the road on the left," she writes, "you will find the modern public school brown and white, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of any kind as well as anything that can be used by passing people.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with a self-government but also with literacy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait everyone liked.
Zora well described the reality " declared Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's young girls that Hurston immortalized, citing the colorless songs, played by men who praised their beauty."
She added: "Some people didn't like it."
We always remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who often came back after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, on board a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many mocked her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he adds, swinging in his chair of the posterior patio that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "it never remained too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy she offered to the world," said Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials at Orange County wanted to move a five-lane highway into town to replace Kennedy Boulevard, two-lane main street in the community.
Orlando's development has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over the mixture of races led hatred to the doors of the community.
"At that time, a group of young whites came to throw oranges or objects at people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"a lady even passed away. "
They threw a watermelon out of their car."
In a 1955 letter addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glorifying my race".
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and weakened the trust of young people.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember well - we kissed our master in the morning, and also in the evening" said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins as well as chief director of the Saver of the Community of Eatonville, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until teachers and students stopped coming from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white- I mean there's a line of cultural demarcation here," said Miss Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have allowed to create space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the prejudice, such as her, armed with a joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as:"How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's anonymous grave and began to struggle to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a biography acclaimed on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduced it to American cannons.
The highway project came just as the most famous girl in Eatonville had found her attraction.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors see her as a lifeguard.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many came back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the highway proposal.
"The fiasco of the five-way highway, extremely fast, a true civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summed up the whole saying that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been classified as a historic city since 1998.
A single theme library (renamed Hurston, of course) opened in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, renovated.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a rear street on a day of summer rain, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
( Today there are 90 per cent black people)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
You have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things- like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields- should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weakness for bright red, are always afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride is emerging.
Young people in particular tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is true civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for local government or police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger ones, like 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned correctly the description Eatonville.
"Most people, who pass through this area, will think:" oh, this city has nothing compared to others" Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it's a beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone is fluent in finance.
Still, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think only in the glass and bee nest offices above their head, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "work day at the office" since the crash of 1929.
Deliverers continue to sneak on sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
Latinos always drag between residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke placed on their shoulders.
Office employees continue to queue up to buy their morning sandwich from street merchants, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. per week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work late after noon, because I discovered my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, some 20 people in line.
Not in front of cashiers' counters, nor in order to withdraw from the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service counter, where the usual customers ordered their checkers, the tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker," all queued for the same reason as I did.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, and that claim to treat customers as their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 capital bank used the bankruptcy trustee, and while the New Yorkers were coming home for the weekend this Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, desperately sought a buyer to save her.
The office and store employees in front of me, scared of another potential debacle, transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, the one that does the most rescue on Wall Street.
Any New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I was hearing a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and her skinny CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lynn, the concierge in uniform from my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetable dealer.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take any chances."
Profaned Muslim Tombs while Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and , Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "towns against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They have road signs showing mosques striped in red.
The police accuse extreme right-wing extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend of the victory of the extreme right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to the police, of organized action.
The offenders painted on several graves Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, the detectives think that this could have been done to disguise the hatred of extremists towards Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said that she was "deep shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurred just during the religious month of Ramadan that reached its end.
Austria is seriously thinking about regaining its courage, following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties, which accounted for almost 30 per cent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even regarded, according to critics, as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, conducted his campaign against the wearing of scarf and burkas, and even expressed opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections defined the extreme right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter forbids travelling abroad.
The courts have banned rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after expressing their intention to travel to Spain via France to the authorities under his control.
The police in Kent had granted this ban on travelling last Thursday after proving to the magistrates Glitter's guilt for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at Ashford's court hearing, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said "Thursday, September 25th, in Ashford court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gaddd from travelling to France and Spain until March 25th.
"Paul Gadd was not there then."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leaving to be registered on the list of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve up to five years of imprisonment.
Kent police stated that they would not discuss specific cases or potential displacements of Glitter in the county.
A word from Kent's police said, "Kent's police will do everything they can to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
"According to us, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"Protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize the potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, respectively, aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he should have boarded for a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and refused to go to London.
Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and therefore were forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on 22 August and, while his lawyer, David Corker, went to Uxbridge Limited Court of Justice, West London, for registration in the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the United Kingdom for the detention of images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior stated that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master off the stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no braiding clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where one discovers intimate gestures and stolen eyes of artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some staged with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the special iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a clean character.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera moments of personality of the flamenco stars. "
With the festival "Popular Song of Mines", Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, recall classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about dancing or singing itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the public with his art.
The search for the essentials and magic was the constant of this work presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book of collection of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph people's portraits, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a longer or shorter time.
I think in photography the portrait is the hardest kind.
You find yourself in front of people, characters you sometimes don't know or just give you a few minutes to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true. "
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at number 20 of rue de la Mata (street parallel to the People of Hercules) which will be opened until 16 October next.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true bold"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel that has as its main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and who has passed through the Amazon.
The favorite at the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday to the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it "is a real audacity" and that "everything demonstrates that it should not write it".
"If I were reasonable, I would not, but I will do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts which for four days saw a parade in the city of the aqueduct of about 100 writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and completed his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award with the majority of the participants' voices, made a full room at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Felix Romeo, found himself faced with a fascinate audience who did not see the last hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst for reading" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote a "very methodical hand" thanks to intense documentation work, correcting and rewriting a part of the text to face his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspired his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "making people less similar", because writers were asked "not to be allowed to go to frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather spoils Pozoblanco fair
The flag festival that concluded the bull races of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse bullfighters verified that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather was hard on this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
On the poster there were José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have fought in the arena of Castilblanco.
So only the Friday party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and was worn in triumph, after making arm movements facing the bull tastefully and aesthetically.
In the afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered steps applauded more than his fight in itself with the bull.
Worse yet for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without sorrow or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the public.
Police check of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five hours minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Euskadi police (the Ertzaintza) at the border of the municipality of Arminón (Alava).
Police officers arrested two occupants of a van and the latter two began the flight.
Its loading, more than two tons of hashish, to stop them from.
The police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to information released by the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alva Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle check on the N-1, at the border of the Municipality of Arminjón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, abruptly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometres later on the lower side, where the two occupants went down to flee into a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hash balls and then transferred to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drugs.
In addition, the officials found that the registration plate had been "falsified" since it did not coincide with the one written on the grey card of the van, which is why they also charged the detainee with an offence of forgery of documents.
Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the source of the seized drug.
The detainee, A.A.J. 28 years of age, has been warned to carry out the various procedures and will be tried in the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the effect of a drug.
A witness saw her do strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to what a California police patrol spokesman revealed to People magazine.
The witness stated that at around 4:30 p.m. Locklear "puts heavily on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and walking back several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who at first had not recognized the actress, saw Locklear stopping in the middle of the highway and leaving his vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," that's why the agents drove her to the drug and alcohol centre to run a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was discarded from the outset, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat herself with nervous depression.
Callazares asked the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The General Coordinator and Member of Parliament for the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it was the regional federation that took a decision on the case of the former councillor for Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing favorive treatment for members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Callazares regarding the conduct of the political party that it will have to adopt on the Seville municipal council.
However, the leader of the United Left asked that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants".
"Mayo Blood", Garci's dared bet
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Spanish battle against the French in "Blood of May", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film of more than two and a half hours' duration, "May Blood" will be released in the cinemas next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci assures that with this film "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago, to make a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2, Madrid, which he always accepted when the story was based on national historical facts.
The EUR 15 million provided by the Commune of Madrid is a "unique opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothes the atmosphere of "a Spain that has erred as leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not getting funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than twice as much as he got for "May Blood", because he could not turn a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated throughout his career.
The filmmaker of "Back to Begin" influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of the actors, with whom he used to repeat before starting the shooting and to whom he does not cast, since it seems to him "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and to the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de Mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times an Oscar candidate (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy," Blood of May","Seven tables of French billiards" and finally the winner,"The Blind Sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "who deserves to be better known," he said.
With this film Garci does not expect a price.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, and then you realize that you're working for prosperity, and now you're just making an extra movie," says Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón gets into the skin of the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Seville dancer will pay tribute to a Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and who at the age of three will live in London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer who specializes in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneer of women's liberation, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of the dance in Europe of the interwar, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered to interpret the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" reminded me of a Cuban folk dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers," she says.
The performance was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will again sing Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done at "The Open Door"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me. "
The staging was also done thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered divas".
This work also recounts, in a way, the life of this woman who has exhibited in such distant places, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think it is these women who have enormous influence in their time and now no one knows and highlights her work," Bayón says.
The show will begin at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope Theatre in Vega
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a recently married Poet" in St Stephen's Church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trinnat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Trinnat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This people of light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling to the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia has purchased eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most well-known Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This sentence is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence de malice", and illustrates well the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer from this world.
He had trouble getting an Oscar.
He hasn't been turning since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
This has been a hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels exceeds all expression, and now I lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of making themselves ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and the homeland died during a particularly obscure period, when terrorists and stock markets are afraid, the American esteem has fallen far short, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, there is only admiration for humans and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own bio food brand.
It was a victory for a country that had difficulty in imposing itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expanding wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, the oscarized Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He has placed the bar on us," noted George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to pierce the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious private life and far from the goals.
It's still not easy or possible in today's media jungle.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though the opportunities did not fail him to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends his daughters' encounter with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"Among all the great roles he played, he was never as proud as the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropist," he said.
Madrid in the race to organize the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of an elimination note.
But let us examine everything in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes start with the withdrawal of the dossards, which forces you to go ahead.
It's not bad, but if they get you to move it would be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the backpack (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need an XL size)
Which world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small jerseys with less fabric and thus cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that you have to go there very early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which the rebellions and attacks of the barracks took place.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that, I think, did not mark the departure correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, it would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the Y.O. of 2016.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
A new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to travel on the company's campus) was presented at the MIT's Conference on Emerging Technologies Microsoft in response to what was asked of it during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who are - including remembering what positions they occupy - and listening and hearing the key words of their conversations.
But also group them together according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks her if she's here to visit someone and she tells her she'll answer her in a few moments.
All this without blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked in addition to a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is Google's first move to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operating system will always be necessary as this is the indispensable basis for computer hardware and software to be understood.
He is in the same position as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but we must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but increasingly to the Internet browser.
The computer is turned on only to make Firefox, Explorer or Chrome spin and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than running through windows.
To whom do half of the applications provided with the system serve?
Who can do the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, month cumbersome, less complex.
For the time being, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android being late and the iPhone already on the market will cost them a lot.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso put it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in the ' Blood Diamond' of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in 'The Sponsor' of Francis Ford Coppola and was part of the association of muscular gays.
And if we start listing all of his appearances, we could also mention this mustachu rib that lifted weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a simple menswear made of cotton, moulding and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all the others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although he is known as ' Marcel' - which has to do with sport since he takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel is distinguished from others by his excellent cotton, by his unisex cut, by his distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag ( barely recognizable) that the best known body jerseys have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce top tanks.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babes, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even though it's a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate does not worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Today the sisters Cruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they're not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
She was present for the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also for the presentation of the most important prices of fashion that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica's warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honour of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 1950s and 1960s enchants us and inspires us a lot for our collections.
I love walking around town and watching women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe that yes, but in the end everything is joined together and these activities have many things in common.
Since I was little, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's place to look in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers like to dress up for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you wear the clothes, it's at that moment that you really get into the character's skin.
So it's all connected.
You had 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30s are happy.
I think the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoy life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I've wanted to do since I was a little girl and it's given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna be a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks me and, moreover, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, wait for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
That's right, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I am a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I look forward to the films 'The Last Hour' and 'Looking for the Tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what you'll think...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the bridge to do the model.
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite a while, to invite me to participate in a charity parade in London for her association in support of women and the clothes we exhibited - I showed two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
The people Naomi is a person with a tender heart.
They say so much about her, I know her, a lot of things are not true.
Besides, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Recidivists of alcohol in the steering wheel will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting in a state of drunkenness, or if it does not blow.
The initiative has already been announced last June and is now reflected in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver by offering him courses in road rehabilitation.
The Minister of State for Road Safety, as well as the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Technological Institute for Automotive Safety Foundation, will participate in this initiative.
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of the drivers arrested for driving more than once in a state of drunkenness, the car resumes.
Alcoholock would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow ahead; or when the alcohol level of the driver is higher than that allowed.
Its cost is more than 1000 euros and is at the driver's expense.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of the infringements during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people every year.
This measure is based only on administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with these behaviours before they turn into criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, however, reform by criminal means requires reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote for an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install in the school buses this system as it was done in France.
Mexico without "peep-toes"
At 1740 hours, scheduled official time, the Spanish air force aircraft in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of falling but its rays still forced to put their hand as a visor so that they could see the royal couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to complete their official journey.
- Oh, all right, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this hour... are you from here or...?
- No, sir, I'm Spanish, but I've lived here for two years.
- Oh, all right...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
They are several to wait in the airport hangar near the red carpet and at a military row made up of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop at the photographers before passing through the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny Mexican television journalist awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There is certainly no place more suitable in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is certainly no living cartoonist more extraordinary and good live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Button-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in Mango's window at 54 Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and she almost cried with emotion.
Certainly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is located in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, have caused us to meet in a luxurious dinner at the opera Garnier de Paris.
As a neighbouring table, that of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango, seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown big on the heart and making against bad fortune good heart, because of the recent death of his brother, Nati put on a mango garment and some ELAH trims, which cut the breath, and arm on it, arm under with his son Luis - a handsome man of almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, and the Baron de Rotchil ended the evening without a vest because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who presented herself at the store with a pants and shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner metamorphized by wearing a sexy and black long dress, moved when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and remembering the good old days, she grabbed one of the bars and she made the gesture of a 'big fold'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the buildings of the palace, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another handsome man who travels on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and asking in advance, that there be no smell in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the antistress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of daily life.
And to crown everything, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The morning alarm almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it's even worse when we think of the agitated rhythm that is imposed on us by today's life.
The desk is synonymous with tension and the back pain computer.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one or two methods to combat daily fatigue and work-related problems.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to everyone's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at bookstores directly from the editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline does not run into your veins to restore the balance of your body and if stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, disconnect from his mind and focus on reading.
Talk while sleeping
Some kids talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who speak during their sleep.
The first time this happens may surprise you, but it doesn't really matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called drowsiness.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one talking at night.
This phenomenon can appear in a very sporadic way (for example, once in life associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day according to the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often linked to other sleep impairments such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (piping in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stress or overexcitation situations.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, murmurs or on the contrary with cries, tears, long speeches ...
If somniloquia becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to obtain an explanation for this problem.
We said it's a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it's related to another sleep alteration that can be treated (for example, if it's related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have difficulty relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down inside.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleepyloquies appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will no longer remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and then rests.
Remember that if it is very distressed several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not have the temptation to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because by sleeping, he's not conscious to be able to organize his thinking.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you won't know what he's dreaming about, so be careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can interview him at night to know his secrets.
Not even by joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the path of victory on his ground after a long period of distaste.
Without making a big game, the Yellows and Blacks created the largest number of opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the game.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann, who was rubbing the lucarne on a far shot, Illhaeusern was going to take slightly the ascendant and turn Fonderflick from a far way, then with Hirn above, Romain from the end of the foot or Diebold came to tickle Dannemarie's defense.
In front of it, we were stuck in the middle of the ground, and we were just leaving the Riahi mutant at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed by Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball repelled on a first attempt by Diebold (53e').
But the Illhousians will not be able to enjoy his happiness long and will be forced to return to the changing rooms a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in inferiority digital.
But Dannemarie won't be able to take advantage of it and won't pose any big problems to an Illusian onze who just stepped back a little to "compact" his defense, except in the last few seconds of the game where, after a big cockroach, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy to meet angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of force of the fishermen who strongly disrupted on Monday the access of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec, in Finistère, on Tuesday morning, to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit which falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of the flight of gas prices, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to the spokesman for Elysée David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and compensation of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected on a firm foot by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing closures of nearly 10 km.
Quiberon's marina was also blocked, but links to Belle-île were not stopped.
A filter dam was set up on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports of the Atlantic façade and the Channel, such as the Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where trawlers have stayed at dock, or in Havre, where about 20 ships have blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important refinery Total de Donges.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday in the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not let go" and "they will not want to move to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, for example.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but believe that the profitability threshold of a vessel is only reached with a diesel less than €0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Beautiful
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died from cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes praised the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast in 2008
Brazil's aircraft operator has a total of 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the recession threats to the world economy.
The fourth world aviation manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecast for 2008 with 215 devices delivered, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft operator delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes much of the Chinese market especially for its aircraft of the range ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider assigning more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurer, which the US monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to divest more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activity in the United States, says the newspaper that quotes sources close to the file.
The Board of Directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to examine possible assignments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG plans to separate include its international leasing subsidiary Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer, and its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these divestitures, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly build up liquidity to repay the loan of 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders to a proportion.
Analysis Paris Session History Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange charged a historic fall on Monday following the rejection by the House of Representatives of the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Warning (DJIA) dived from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest fall in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, with technological dominance, yielded 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (or 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the Bank Rescue Plan, which was intended to restore some stability to the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, representatives denied the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he was asking for.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was going on in this area," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would "be too late".
"If the project is actually moribund (...) then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed (the US central bank, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, Chief Economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every passing day brings the fall of a financial institution" to the United States, said Mrs Piegza.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities organized the buyback of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets are facing "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis," FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3.632 percent, compared to 3.827 percent on Friday night, and to 4.161 percent at 30 years, compared to 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama, winner at the points of the first televised duel
In the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House, another one succeeded to find out who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, took it.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign HQs proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honourable, was not "bright enough" to allow him to stop his decline in polls to five weeks by the presidents.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion survey published on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% McCain), found that it was the Democrat who pulled his pin out of the game.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama won 39% of the poll, while 25% of the pollers win McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the expected good performance of his parceler, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's got good instincts," warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seven-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while stressing his opponent's "naivety" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without disassembly, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still didn't understand, while Obama did," he said, this weekend, a democrat spot accusing the Republican of not taking the full measure of the impact of the crisis on "the American street".
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in a stormy rain.
He did not even say the words "medium class" or "workers."The financial setback clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most capable of saving the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"The coming week could be a decisive turning point," said the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final eight-year verdict of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that it would still be possible to reduce taxes by 95 per cent of Americans despite the outbursts of Wall Street, the honourable senator of Illinois also pointed out that the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, the two candidates avoided questions about the $700 billion financial rescue plan (470 billion euros) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislation.
A few hundred Belarussians met on Sunday evening at the closure of polling stations in Minsk Central Square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislature.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admit they didn't even vote: "What a good thing, since they will do what they want with my voice," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has been good to foreign observers with the aim of resuming language with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered to be specific by observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting," lamented Iuri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous group of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is what counts the voices, and in our home, it's the executive power.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for laws."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters into crisis, and we do not reform ourselves, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the election.
She pointed out that participation figures appeared too high, and that the generalisation of advance voting (26% of voters in Minsk) had opened the door to all manipulations.
"Have you noticed that there was an election, you question Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five MPs from the opposition to parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls back to the place of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The interview - Blood became safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, as Hema-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained the confidence of the public that had been seriously shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood supplies managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for such a disaster to cease.
While Justice Krever was late in filing his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan for a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gelineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," recalls Dr. Decary.
The situation was discouraging.
With efforts to improve the safety of blood and work products on the ground during the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said before proudly affirming that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation, on September 28, 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were seen in Europe, the one that has held the fort since its founding in 1998.
"And we did not know at all whether this disease could be transmitted by blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when it is not known and a serious disease can result from it, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration leading inevitably to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was refused.
A few years ago, however, it has been shown beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode has thus shown us that the precautionary principle that has been applied has meaning."
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for HIV testing appeared on the market: the nucleic acid (NAT) tests, which allow the presence of the virus itself in the blood of donors and not the presence of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
TANs have been able to shorten the silent period, which extends from the time the person was infected to the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This substantially reduced the risk that some donors would be infected without knowledge and could not be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," says the Chief Executive Officer of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant," says Dr. Décary before pointing out that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
"Needs increase because the population ages.
Since anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need recharge in red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also has consequences on the blood donor network, which averages only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
Any healthy person aged 18 years and over who meets the eligibility criteria may still give blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria occurs, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer give their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become a regular donor.
Today's life is so frightening, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving blood," says Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye globes and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to collect more than a thousand of it a year.
We should start proposing for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Decary, who describes this blood collection program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed to be unable to access it," as Héma-Québec has no means to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in semi-finals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the elimination series of the first USL division, thanks to a victory of 3-1 (4-3 in total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, in the second and decisive match of the quarter final series to the total goals, at Stade Saputo.
The middle of the field Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of play.
After a first half goalless on both sides, the field environment David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other nets of Montreal's formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first round-trip game on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-final.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win it 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the semi-final round 5-4 in total goals.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Winning goal of Kovalev
Canadian trio number one is ready to start the season.
The unit made up of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win at the Florida Panthers at the Bell Centre last night.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec raised two aides, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to do too much in the first period," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation."
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the initiation of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party General Council was finished, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Quebec, yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to get elected on the occasion of today's by-election.
"Remove the limits of our last major northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the broad outlines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, some kind of image mill was projected.
They circled, on three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec, seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Major means, as in the electoral period.
At a press point, the Prime Minister refused to exclude him from launching the elections this fall, even though he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, merely explained why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not give rise to any maturity, investment amounts or specific priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydropower, the forest, but especially the mining sector, driven by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's listing.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it home, but it's in us," he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister at the press briefing.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the northwest passage, which will open all year round because of the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the locals, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP from Ungava), have already begun consultations with some 30 communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "a common vision will be given".
Northern development would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal prime minister who preceded it.
"Like the Liberals who preceded us, we thought differently to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Centrale in the Adelard-Godbout Barrier.
"De Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage who made the quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydropower, in Bourassa who made the James Bay, our party managed to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
At a press point, he referred to another reference, conservatively, to the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest pointed out that its launch was scheduled for 2012.
"It stays between us there, but I plan to be there," he told his activists, raising nourished applause in their homes.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a poll this fall, which the law allows him.
He points out, however, that his schedule is met, notably by a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the Weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that went as a letter to the post: the PLQ calls in particular for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and that they would have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcomed the broad lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The Pacific leader, Pauline Marois, emerged from the North Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government launched in 2001.
In her view, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up its application.
Had he done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Ms Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutin which is taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The QAD said it supported the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonored country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (O irony) in Harper's office, who last summer allowed herself to say that Louise Arbour was a "honour" for Canada.
Thus cast the reproach on this woman who waged an incessant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration for it, as much as she says about the Prime Minister's entourage as about Stephen Harper himself.
We are faced with a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the events accused of him.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing of the Geneva Convention, refuses to speak and allows a child-soldier to croup under inhuman conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
As a reminder, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, advocate for the repatriation of Omar Khadr to enjoy a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We don't realize it yet, but we are now witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", this word that Harper keeps brandishing and which sounds so hollow in his mouth.
Here comes the time when no morals exist anymore: we can mislead, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the will of a head of government until now minority (what will then be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Truth, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what was doing the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, she's here, in this waiver, and not anywhere else.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President Director of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, he claims that the largest gold company in the world has initiated a defamation suit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without money in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the Black Canada book will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and to fight, with very unequal arms, against an army of lawyers backed by almost no-bottom pockets of mining.
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, are often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will stun the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to look back at the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is being done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are normally conducted through the exchange of ideas and not by beatings.
It was therefore sufficient for mining to open its books, its records and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects from the back of his hand the petitions and letters of support to Black Canada's authors.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate while ignoring the views of the same public?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers only to paid and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What does not understand - or does not want to understand - Barrick Gold is that the public that supports Black Canada's authors and publishers does so primarily because it rejects the brutal manner of mining.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a barbell chase (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a statement against Black Canada's authors urging them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in block, the right to quote credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that displease the rich businesses of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by Black Canada's authors.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the academic world, as well as to the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this type of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months still needs to be endorsed by both Congress chambers.
In particular, it provides for: improved control by the elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for default, and a right to look at wages paid to the managers of the assisted enterprises.
The U.S. Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday after a two-day marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, trauma, chaos and disruptions to the daily lives of Americans will be immense," Republican Judd Gregg said.
The negotiations had turned to sprint in the last few hours for fear of the effect of a new failure on the mood of investors.
The time limit that had been agreed was the opening of the markets this morning.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that they were forced to reach that end.
Senator Barack Obama attributed himself to the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including the provision to allow the owners to keep their homes and the addition of the salary of the leaders of the companies rescued by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be congratulated for.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the waves of American television.
Asked on another channel to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The broad lines I have read [show] that this is something that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers' money the doubtful, risky and unsold debts of US financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgages at risk (subprimes) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leading to a liquidity freeze and the debandade of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans who had the first draft agreement overturned last week.
It is believed that they have come out of this impasse since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round the angles for everyone in Congress, it was also added a provision stipulating that if the government were to incur losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its bet.
The new plan provides for a first tranche of 250 billion to be paid in addition to another 100 billion if the President deems it necessary.
Another 350 billion is expected to be approved by another Congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get a stake in the rescued companies that will be worth dividends in the event of profit and that he will be able to resell when the torment is over.
The federal government will be given the opportunity to delay the seizure procedures for housing for the real estate loans affected by this plan, as well as to set limits on compensation and severance benefits paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The plan's architects would like to see it submitted to the House of Representatives today and to the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Indeed, votes continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camp.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Chamber's Finance Committee, at the address of his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that involves taking advantage of taxpayers."
Moderator of a small group at the Congress called "the caucus of skeptics", Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us to tell us: Congress is asked not to rush and to examine carefully the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had given up acquiring its competitors in full sinking since it lost 2 billion euros (US$ 2.9 billion) in the crisis of risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In return, you get a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that savers and households now appreciate that times are uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be in the process of nationalizing another bank under the influence of the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would resume all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank, including more than US$41 billion (US$75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon committed
His beauty in the eyes of blue was long his asset card, some will say his weakness.
Had he released himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensibility and a talent that flowed from the source will also have removed him from the power register that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, from lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the late years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and whose long was a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of the freedom and bursting of dramatic conventions.
The mixed bloods often make beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and to a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, last brand of quality.
For in it was projected a whole country surrounded by self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied drama art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theatre, on television, soon at the cinema.
The same man who fought for civic rights was also the car driver who ranked second at the 24 hours of the Mans in 1979, coupled with a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow zones of this secret, discreet, committed, allergic star to the bursts of the show-business are also disappearing with him, whose enigma has not been fully pierced.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's disappearance brought vertigo to the filmmakers this weekend, as his great roles clashed on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual change parades through it.
Back in memory the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a burning roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we mention his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have come to history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, an offender, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, resumed after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic malfrat in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will take back the character on the return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 on nine nominations.
That face through the ages was him.
Him again.
The times are moving through its course.
Young people know him mostly through George Roy Hill's cult Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as Irish Mafia sponsor in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was closed.
Against several cinema legends who left the trade early enough, Newman will remain in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its fatigues and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging his benefits too supported.
The profession was not always tender for the handsome Paul Newman to whom the roles fell long into the beak.
However, he played less often the young first than the marginals: neuroses, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed poorly known facets of his true pudic sensibility.
Her Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine feminine portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the tributes raining yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former arms companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrating traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he is also a great activist for civic rights, ecology, independent cinema, a challenger for Hollywood's drifts.
We've seen a lot of his benette rule over pots of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of quite bad taste, though gag at first.
However, the profits of these sales were paid to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here."
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
They call it a model, in sum and in addition.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company do in their invoice factory?
Next, on 8 October, hearings on the current criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, resulting in particularly significant damage, and other charges have been brought against them, such as falsehood and use of falsehood.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the State and the municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand in the caisses of the Fial Baloldal movement and on the other, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to receive the money from the subsidies obtained by issuing bills of fees, after which no actual benefit was provided and thus, the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained bill books at the Józsefváros market, while manufacturing the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, on tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's testimony, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the basis of which they made the other invoices that they would introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András Łri, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with drafting the files necessary to obtain the grants.
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up on behalf of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which will later bear the name of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért, sprang from faults of form and substance.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three bedrooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. However, the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
In addition, the over-imagination bill issuers fell into excess when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither the name Jobb Jövőért nor the name of Hoppá appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that they were false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the shape, the fact that according to the bill, one hundred people stayed there, also did not collate, since this establishment counts only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of zealous invoices also did not find out about the travel agencies in Budapest, which were part of their choice, but only organizing trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on bills to be paid in cash, which also goes against the agency's accounting practices.
Moreover, as it appeared in the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the travel services, whose destination is outside the European Union, are charged without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Hôtel Révfülöp in the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's services did not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. Moreover, the hotel employees only issued printed invoices, while the counterfeits were handwritten.
The prosecution's investigation revealed that the "issuers" also made mistakes by mentioning as a service the carriage of goods by road, that the invoice company could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
Moreover, it is also for defects of forms, such as inadequate types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturrális Egyesület and Biztos Pont proved false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehertó's sports internship, both of which deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
Nor did the counterfeiters pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have a meal at their home. According to our information, that is why the liquidator of the company denies having issued this invoice.
Deliberately established invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is that composed of those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the group of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has established an invoice to the order of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, it cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the order of the foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for an amount of approximately five million HUF, but after which no performance was actually provided.
No financial movement took place, either, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but that, the agencies did not mention it in their accounts.
The following category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the administrative delegate of the CEO of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the fuel and motor vehicle trade, whose head office was in Budapest, but where it was not possible to find it, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these equipments were allegedly purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov would also have sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt companies in Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he seized their countervalue.
It was precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian masons created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies worked, which the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the founding acts of the companies, he made invoices to their names, to the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations.
Kubatov has given organizations, 15 invoices in total, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The prosecution thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that were used as part of Biztos Pont's grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szövetség Association in Modern Magyarországert submitted a request for a subsidy to the public utility body of the Socialist Party, Tancsics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA).
They have obtained this grant twice as much as 500,000 HUF, but these amounts have not been used for the objectives set out in the application.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search carried out in the office of Árpád Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused will report the method of making invoices, as it had already done before the prosecutor's office.
What could be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the slightest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or perhaps the Socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would carry the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably vexed, since the requests for his placement in supervised residence, on the basis of a relief from his conditions of detention, fall continuously into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and those who commit non-reparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait at their own home for the end of the proceedings, he does not have that possibility.
The psychology of the auction: why do we spend more money?
In auction sales, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Researchers in neurology and economics at the University of New York have been able to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
This research has attempted to develop a neurological pattern of this type of "game" using experimental auction sales.
One of the volunteer groups played the lotus, while the other group took part in a play auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (FMRI) process, researchers analyzed the active brain domains of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, one of the essential elements of which is a third party's auction, the whole under the brain stem, called stratum, was moving intensively during the loss of the party.
This part of the brain, next to several other functions, plays a role in the "self-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight to the violent reaction of the stratum.
In support of their theories, economists from this group of researchers continued financial monitoring analyses.
In these cases, three groups were overburdened by a partner under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and thus carried out their placement.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would win the game, then they would receive an additional $15 as a reward.
While the third group received these $15 before the auction, the group members also lost that money in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was on victory, while on failure.
By thus proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team of players "against failure" were willing to higher bets than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each one explained the phenomena found in auction sales only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only the methods of neurological imaging have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories, leading, now, to a third explanation." - found Andrew Schotter, the professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned as one of the first causes of death.
An estimated one hundred thousand patients with hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles are treated because of the fact that patients often do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to liver infections caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and congenital diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogenic genes, mainly spread in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g., contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D, and other viruses by blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is in any case recommended to be vaccinated against A and B viruses. There is no C vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, usually accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then a visible yellowish develops on the skin and on the white of the eye, the stools become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, one million people die every year from the most serious form of this disease, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause of this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know how to get infected with the virus, because the pathogenic gene is dimly destroying liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms only appear after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected through a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor when you see symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured, if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does the one who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a sort of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article according to which researchers at the University of Oxford realized an interesting experience by analyzing the level at which belief in God could influence tolerance to human pain.
As part of this experience for the least odd, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experiment takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and spreading electroshocks is attached to the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look at two paintings in a sustained way, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the hermine painted by Léonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among the believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, had its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, they received 20 electroshocks in four successive parts, while looking at either religious theme painting or more general theme painting.
The Catholics said that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "safe", as someone who "takes care of" and they "quietly, and peace has invaded them".
In view of the painting of religious theme, they reported 12% less pain than when looking at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in atheists, provided he finds the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, praised the results of this research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, it actually changes our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, there is only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of subjects if the believers are shown a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same calibre?
Would the view of a Virgin Mary of better quality lead to better results?
You're what you're divulging about yourself.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google states that it can be found at the bottom of the people's pocket just like the sky above their head. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what are their interests.
However, it is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society.
While with regard to sceptics establishing a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they do not see exactly the essentials of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt said recently in the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that Google's founders can meet their initial goal, which sounded as follows: "Let's gather in a system all the information in the world!".
According to Google's leader, after ten years of world-leading work, they are still at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
To the question: what will happen in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What would be the best work for me?" However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first sight, on the day they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then consulted by interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and view what they have been looking for, what they have clicked on. As a result, in the long term, Recommendations, a program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services based on our previous statements and registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my work is? ask users, who worry about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can generate fear, and it is not the remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or possibly the revolt against power that can provoke a counter-reaction among Internet users.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of recent times is probably coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing an identification.
Human rights netizens were able to push a sigh of relief last May, when Google, with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, was able to prove its right to the court in front of the FBI. According to the ruling rendered, in the future, Google still cannot be forced by any of the points in the constitution to disclose information about the secret request of the FBI, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several years ago. But ultimately, it failed to obtain the lists of searches of private users, nor the full list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is fustigated by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and private domain suffer from it when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against the proud multinational corporations of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "savageons" bringing together the enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the "connected body", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, even though both fight for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the package of programs, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what Web 2.0, the most proclaimed key word of recent years, is right behind it.
In fact, web 2.0 does not concern anything other than collaboration, that the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use channels of communication made available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and he can even link them to other performances, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which they automatically appear their latest photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can get to know many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands in view of the photos of the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her infidel friend spent the evening, or that of the society that dismissed one of her employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, one can be on one thing: the term of privacy is totally to be reconsidered today.
The one who lives an online life consists of what he shows of himself, and that is how one can define the principle hiding behind the behavior of today's young people.
He wants to hide something, or at least he wants to try to bypass Google's monopoly, he can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using Google's search system, but at the same time intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who, deliberately, do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not least. Google's online services, by processing text to image processing, to read information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge server parks and do not assemble our best profile, which have existed to date.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced at an increasing rate lead to serious migraines not only to Microsoft, but to many other computer program creators.
However, the critical observers find, beside all this, contradictions with disturbing effects: for example, the company's top management has refused, in its entirety, the employee's protests, after it has doubled the price of the company's nursery and after the company has judged the daily multiple restoration too expensive, taken at any time. All this seems to be derisory beside the fact that already in 2006, Google acquiesced before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the internal rules of society, the new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is on, is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new issues. While some think that Google's book and magazine scan and archiving project takes on such important dimensions that society will soon find itself facing the U.S. Supreme Court, others tremble in front of its health system, because in it, we can build a complete medical profit from our results from previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half-ton Orwellians, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way only through Google's data.
Two minors helped eliminate the traces of the double homicide of Ózd
"The police have summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of Ozd. According to well-founded suspicions, they have helped to make the traces of the crime disappear." - said the spokesman of the police department of Borsod.
Young people have recognized the facts that are being blamed for them, and for the time being, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) reports, are young girls, defend themselves freely.
The complicity of murder can lead to detention of up to five years.
The suspect of the double homicide of Ózd, a 23-year-old local youth, was held in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, premeditated and by interest.
During the investigation, it was found that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to settle his debt and that's why he lured his creditor last Wednesday to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as the 9-year-old daughter of this man.
According to MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the crime scene is proof of it.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the assistance of specialists.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the buy-back of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw stock exchange has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech kroner, for the 100% buy-back of the stock package of the Prague stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish made despite the fact that the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State which wishes to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer ever made for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new lowest owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated at between 5 to 10 billion Czech kroner by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the paper would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the Patria Finance investment bank, with about 25 percent stakes, followed by 14.7 percent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their Tuesday comments on the international financial crisis, worsening from day to day, the leading newspapers of the European press already mention a "second 11 September".
"The global financial disaster, we owe it to the American President" - accuses the daily life of Rome, La Repubblica. "The President has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised at the vanguard, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the shortcomings of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is increasing every day, and then the whole world will pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the congressional vote, a real threat, the one that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
We cannot ignore the threat any longer - stresses the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states can still give their financial institutions a life-saving buoy, and thanks to their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse such as dominoes, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the states of the European Union to pay little attention to their national selfishness, and to centralise control over the divided financial markets.
Only Monday, the weakened financial institutions received more than €100 billion - recalled the Viennese daily, Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hand in the pocket, very deep, in a way similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, become more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really taken care of the crisis, which, like a tsunami, goes through the old continent on its own.
The "sauveurs" should not immediately brand a hundred billion euros, on the other hand it would be wise if they noticed what a rational case it would be to touch the taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing further damage.
The smart car mimics the theft of the bourdon
What method would be better for developing technologies that are capable of avoiding an obstacle, if it is not the imitation of an obstacle detector already existing in nature?
Like, for example, bees.
In the amazing project presented at CETEC, taking place in Japan, the buzzing bees gave the strategic idea of departure to engineers at Nissan, to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a self-robotized, bio-inspired BR23C system, which it has equipped with bees qualities, the ultimate objective being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During his flights, each bee constitutes his own space, oval shape, which in reality looks very much like our secure protective hull - he explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and technological public relations of the brand.
The facet eye of the bee plays a primary role, since it is capable of seeing in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the face-to-face eye, engineers have approached the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor on board, which turns it into an escape manoeuvre immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning from a sufficient angle to avoid collision.
Unlike any system currently in existence, this avoidance manoeuvre is entirely instinctively carried out.
"If it wasn't, the mini-auto robot couldn't react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and the most internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where the collision is considered inevitable for the moment.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place at a glance.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees possess to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use rotating motion, acceleration and slowing down as maneuvers available to the mini robot
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a greater energy concentration, making their lifespan longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not data processing, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should treat only a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
We don't need memory of a giga-byte capacity, or even mega-bytes.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology for instant avoidance. Nissan estimates that this system will be entering serially manufactured cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at redeeming the doubtful loans of banks, and using them several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that in further discussions that continue until after midnight, Saturday, local east coast time, Congress leaders have agreed on the controversies that have existed for days and days around the $700 billion rescue plan.
"We have taken a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, according to which there is nothing left but to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The U.S. Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, said by commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, however other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not, here, about the rescue of Wall Street, but about turning the economics around in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8 p.m., Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to the local time of Central Europe), but it did not cause a spectacular rise in scholarships.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill responding to the name of the 2008 emergency economic stabilization law. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress made tonight, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House.
In addition, the program diverges from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which stated that the $700 billion had to be spent in one single time, for the redemption of doubtful credits.
From now on, up to half of the 700 billion sum can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably Monday. This first sum will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to buy suspicious claims from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The program will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The spending of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to put in place a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase doubtful claims, mortgages and doubtful mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The department's competent persons stated that redemptions may take place in the course of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools behind the concerns, for which companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to allocate $700 billion for the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast buyback of doubtful debts, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system leading to the collapse of one or the other important financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for law enforcement, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders in bad postures and waiting for state aid can expect their severance payments, simply called the overseas golden parachute, to be capped by the government.
Salary caps are only mentioned in specific cases, and limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys back in the context of an auction, they will collect a surplus of tax on the gold parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the purchase of doubtful receivables, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exaggerated.
In order for the image to be complete, it must be added that the existing golden parachutes are not changed. The ceiling only concerns the new contracts, thus motivating participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal caps will be in force regarding the additions of the Directors General - commented the chairman of the committee in charge of the financial benefits of the Chamber of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State obtains a right to acquire shares in the banks taking part in the plan. Thus, the risk of taxpayers decreases, since they can even be won in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks fall back on their legs.
The bill states that in the next five years, the President must introduce to Congress a proposal that will decide on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That's not why American citizens sent us, it doesn't protect taxpayers' dollars - California's Republican MP Darrell Issa said.
Her Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, believes that they are the same who are pressing for action, as are those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices rose by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month, and 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007 - reports the Hungarian Central Statistics Office.
Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008, while compared to the previous year, they decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 3.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices rose only to a lesser extent: 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industries were only slightly higher in the range of 0.1 per cent compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), with first, the manufacture of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 per cent, then the production of shoes with 2.5 per cent monthly increase.
The higher price level of plastics and chemical raw materials resulted in a substantial monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
The result was a deflation in the oil processing sectors (1.4 per cent), in the manufacturing of machinery and electrical equipment (0.9 per cent), and a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry increased from 0.2 per cent to 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, representing a significant share of domestic industrial operations, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices established by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of processing sectors, the most significant increase in prices in the oil processing sector (32.4 per cent) was observed.
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, prices increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food production, beverages and tobacco, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price reductions have taken place in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacturing of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, price increases have changed from 0.6 per cent to 9.1 per cent.
In the processing industry as a whole, prices have increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
The prices of the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded those of the previous year by 18.7 per cent.
Among the domestic trade groups and by sector allocation, in August, the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was shown by investment-based profit-initiators.
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while in the energy and materials sectors for further processing there was no change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase in energy and material production was observed for further processing (16.8 per cent).
In consumer goods production sectors, an inflation rate of 6.8 per cent was measured, while for profit-producing sectors, a decrease of 1.4 per cent was measured.
The export prices of the industrial sector in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 per cent over 12 months.
In one month, our national payment method has weakened by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it has increased by 7.5 per cent against the euro and by 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that the American-Hungarian visa-exempt agreement will come into force on January 12, which is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now, everything depends only on the time when the offshore electronic entry and control systems will be put into service."
Every time, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations today in Washington.
He will meet with the Foreign Minister, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will give the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the Foreign Policy Advisors of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, assured their support of the $700 billion government bailout plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the U.S. Secretary to the Treasury.
After the marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, the representatives of Congress and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday at dawn, that they had concluded agreements in principle on the rescue plan of the banks.
This financing plan, with the aim of defrosting the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even show up, each as fitter than the other, to drive the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama again managed to get a little ahead of himself. McCain's advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a parceler just after the Republican convention, melted.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly vote on the 700-billion rescue plan law.
He stressed that the proposal contained the consumer protection passages he also supported.
"It is now that we must act, with responsibility... a danger threatens your work, your economies, entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain's economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We will all have trouble swallowing it... but doing nothing is not a possible way."
The Republican senator stated that the proposal referred to the establishment of a Treasury Board and the capping of senior management severance benefits, and that he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill as of Monday.
Press review of German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - that is what the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, refers to.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing information magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this recognized polytologist, the CSU's erosion began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This time change is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and so is that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but Sunday, a process came to an end that was likely from this, just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU collected 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The case can be attributed to the modernization of the region's "devote its parents" in a consistent manner by the CSU.
It has been 40 years since sociologists announced this but they have been strongly mistaken about the pace. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans from the north and east in the region of Bavaria, in full development, could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have rather moved away from the CSU, such as independents, artisans, baccalaureate holders and graduates of higher education.
In these groups, CSU support fell below 40 per cent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? Party presidents stand on the reserve in the face of the issues of the coalition", the conservative Austrian daily is dealing with the situation of the confused domestic policy that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ wish to discuss with the Conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations. Greens still do not want to agree on the coalition.
The elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates organised on public television, party leaders have barely let their cards be seen.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that the cooperation of the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open from Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer approach was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red proposals.
As he has already said, cooperation will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the ÖVP's internal affairs.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is momentarily a completely open question, and these points must absolutely be debated within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, President of BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume governmental responsibilities" - Haider said.
Járóka said: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began in Paris as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokesmen of the expert consultation, Livia Járóka, Euro MP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to the segregations in education, because it is a violation of the law that most affects Roma children and thus one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group Fidesz Parti Populaire, Járóka warned that alongside the distinctions found during the hirings, the Roma disappear from the labour market, first of all, as a result of their low qualification.
"A overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have secondary education diplomas, and as a result of poor elementary education, only a tiny part has the possibility of obtaining a higher education diploma."
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in upholding other fundamental rights.
Investment in the early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the European Union member countries.
According to the Euro MP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Romans.
In fact, the sooner a Roma child starts school, the more likely he is to become a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"By virtue of their citizenship of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low quality and sectarian education." - said Livia Járóka.
According to the MP, a European Union collaboration oriented towards an objective and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of disaggregation of schools. To this end, compliance with existing and prepared anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and the opportunities provided by democracy must be given to Roma children, so that they can participate as citizens of full right in the future of Europe" - Járóka demanded.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the objective of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe, organised every year since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination, which are targeted at European and Member State levels.
CSU: grace for a transition period
The decision on the fate of Huber-Beckstein's fallen duo will be taken in October.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been adjourned.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of voice of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the congress of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair, in any case, felt that they did not hold their seats specially.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the furious members of the fraction and base, which one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, there is only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "one sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives still count heavily in this region of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiated talks with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Government of Munich.
A strange nose of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, the Gabriele Pauli, whose measurement against Stroiber served as a possibility of putsch perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, then treated without household the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now, CSU leaders are putting all their energy into stabilizing, one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far pulled the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former CSU president, designated September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some bitter remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will be able again to be a chancellor only if they are somehow re-established, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of CSU's land will not negatively influence the great Berlin coalition.
However, this is relative because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the socio-democrats always lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 per cent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - its rivals : 110 - 0
No MP of the opposition has acceded to the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's election.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which assures him prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by the illegalities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in this country of 10 million people has been very well opposed for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in the questionable elections, on the traces of the amendment of the constitution in 2006, would "allow" this time the presence of some members of the opposition to parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ gave up its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where due to the Belarusian political order qualified as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive an entry visa, was one of the opposition's expectations. Belarus had to take credit because of the decreasing imports of Russian natural gas, increasingly expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipelines crossing the country, was passed to the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, in assessing the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on failures, such as the ban on a third of opposition candidates, referred to a prior calm.
However, the OSCE press release on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which most opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present during the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize the South Ossetia and the Abazia separated from Georgia. However, Russia with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories already for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU" - Alexandre Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the 2006 candidate for the opposition to the presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains so, despite the fact that "the power has been afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to bring in even one opponent".
The opposition does not foresee protest actions in the light of the results, but rather attempts to send its message on the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on that side: we have to print out our opposition newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put sticks in the wheels for the dissemination, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly" - Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of officially supported retirees no longer really considers it appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is no longer just a matter of time" - Milinkevich says.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." Thus, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had any turning doors for the entry and exit of the employees.
But as of today, this new measure against the smart little ones is in effect, against which he points and then drinks coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-fainants novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The turning doors," says Brunetta, "are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services," says the Minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"It's reformism," added Brunetta.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of the employees has been recorded, says the Secretary General: "It is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the collaboration of all".
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 am is an excellent and healthy resolution."
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister reports that "in three months, the absence of public employees' disease has been reduced by 50%, or 60 thousand workers more in a year".
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics- explains the minister- over the past 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well beyond inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined forces to challenge the standards of the Brunetta decree using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service is now detailing data on the decline of absenteeism in the workplace due to illness- writes the consumer association- the people of the "active lazy" continue to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive public administration employees have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of infirmity for reasons of service is contested; the extension of the hours of the hours of stay of the sick worker during which the check visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, the Inail data confirm that white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures showing the severity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
In order to receive the attention of institutions, social forces and the means of information on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents on the Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data released by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the ongoing efforts to promote prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and public awareness"
"naturally indignant, everyone has punched hands to put an end to such tragedies that, by their size, trigger the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, even though the daily reality presents dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not under assessing the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the president of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed how much "this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and obliges all institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data from the accidents on the work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths still being impressive" later emphasized the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
" we do not want this "reduced tendency" to translate into a minor attention, because it is precisely when attention relaxes that tragedy happens.
"we believe that in general, we don't do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"In our opinion, Mercandelli- more controls and inspections are needed, as is a more important intervention on workers' training, and this, from school."
- He added- "there is still a need to make an effort with regard to communication and public awareness.
"But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Merchandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for the victims of work" and the" drift of assistance to which the system has been directed in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker back the assurance guarantee – he added – so that the fate of the person who has an accident, must not depend on spontaneousism or the enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 player pointed at the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to full volume music for an extended period using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a press release in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the newly identified and unforeseen health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"of this scientific report - we read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full volume music using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per day and per week, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full-volume mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to the scientific data - the responsible Ue- continues it is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and can monitor new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"The scientists-concluded the executive EU- confirm that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties, what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but concern is raised about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data well using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The Ue Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to full volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits on the maximum level of noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This concerns 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified around 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to have the Commission set up for the future of the capital.
Today we begin, in March we finish, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning at the new headquarters behind the Caracalla Baths.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will develop the directives for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the City Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp " of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - it wishes to emphasize Alemanno - it will have to propose ideas for development of Rome that can be used by the political decision makers, who remain the Committee and the Communal Council.
No superimposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will have completed its tasks and will then disappear, as this experience must have a precise temporal duration.
In June the Mayor announced - we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replied: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often the policy is overwhelmed by the management of everyday life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see forward, and further forward, towards a deeper forward-looking, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
Moreover, the Mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and it will not cost the Roman citizens a euro, and it will be used to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "it takes a strategic reference draft, neither firm nor immobile, in order to enable our city to improve itself, which it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit, ".
A future that, the mayor of Rome says, "will not limit itself to the usual communal borders, but that will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but" also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the basis of his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition".
Obama is truly captivated: he believes that he will win the highest function of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!"
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and they do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have polls, which all declare that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, inside the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the polling booth, we know who the American patriot will give his vote to.
This emerges from an aspect of American mentality that has been kept secret until the end.
"Tell us what you want, we'll see ourselves put the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were Bush's mistakes during his tenure? 89 per cent replied: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was kicked back at home.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's weakness.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge spot to accomplish.
In the press, it is time for deletions. And many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of newspaper paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists are now pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the information attachés, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of an economic model destroyed.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work at the newspaper assembly, are a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as the general public understands it is desired to be reduced in a significant way.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and print journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists don't have a problem seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses spawn a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as the "killer" of newspaper paper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to the technology hoping that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest increase in American journalism lies between those who run the newsrooms - that is, the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, whereas at the local level, this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is linked to "work safety".
Directors who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we're going to 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like the U.S., with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 thousand a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, spent a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "damaged" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:ROME TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS AT GROTTAFERRATE.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to dismiss the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for bank route as part of the Unipol-Bnl climbing instruction.
At his trial last week, he had been granted home release as a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent travel from the city of province to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, such displacements (which the PM did not grant) would allow it to influence its society and to have access to the evidence that accuses it.
The elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms to us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more shared between its moderate East Coast soul, favorable to federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the states of Central and South.
The soul, precisely, that was made to feel despotically with the vote that I was talking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just an example of the changes, of the great changes that the current economic earthquake or already lets run: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and it can be not just here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the phenomena that have been covered for some time, to such an extent that, in the new climate, they are solidifying and revealing themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the updating, extraordinary revival, of the double category State-sovereign, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with abroad, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balances of individuals and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only here at home.
Political internationalisation seems really out of the question, or it does not have much to say: the obvious proof is given to us by the European Union, which, as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot decide any common political line.
And so, it is from the government of each state that all expect interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a credit condition: when we go through a difficult period, there are only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements of which no market or international organization will ever be able to dispose of in a similar way.
This new emphasis of the state-nation crisis is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that the more recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor rather linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, indeed, when we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of the ever more sophisticated technology, of non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at once that our future will have to settle its accounts ever more with things rather less material like water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly possesses more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably called Politics, and hence Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who can take control of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadow zone.
And in addition, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: discredit, suffering, an image of inadequateness, a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of West Countries.
Thus further increases the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more alien to the opinions of the majority.
in short, The demand for leadership, feeds underground, a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the "revolts" of improvised elections or, in the changes of collective moods of the latter all the time, from the conservative ascension in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of the workers in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and it might well be that the victory of the right in Italy has not arrived by chance).
It is felt that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, would say someone, have ever more difficulty, which does not date from today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and acts potentially in a disproportionate way.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda, it seems frankly exaggerated.
But you say well, keep your eyes wide open, that's not without reason.
The super glue to walk on the walls.
To overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and, in the future, to walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers managed to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
STUDY- The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called nano carbon tubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a spaghetti pile." Explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology at Atlanta.
Scientists drew inspiration from the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to ensure a perfect adherent.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "removes easily from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton Faculty of Engineering.
MARKING ON DEATHS? –"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since nano carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may be related to aerospace engineering.
For now, no superhero.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to seeking a new adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hair, which self-cleans dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juices.
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These beverages, consumed mainly in the summer because they are disaltering and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vital medicines, alter the absorption amplifying or decreasing, depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether in box or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apples, to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, cancelling their beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized because it has been held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stamine and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
DRUGS A RISK- It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which had given the news in a two-year newsletter, alerting doctors and patients not to under-estimate the danger of this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink, if they take medicines such as Diazépam or Methadone.
NOT THAT PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the University of Milan: "These discoveries are in general, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the information notes of the drugs.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the drugs that are being taken, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist" the expert pointed out to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics at Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that unleashed many polemics, and was reproached by the economist for years, but which has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a very aggressive "style divulgator", particularly critical of the excesses of the Bush administration's liberalism.
Open Office, here's the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package.
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source of personal productivity suite that aims to reach ever more users, from home to office, professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost a year, carried out by volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various new features: welcome screen, and the interface reviewed and became less austere, to other more important ones, such as compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the 2007 Office suite, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, certain functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphic development module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that link the typical Adobe format graph to the elements of a spreadsheet or text editor.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts over changes, in the drafting of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available in addition, for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, the installation cd may be shipped to the home or to the workplace.
And if the theme of gratuity can be a means to spread it to homes, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office the suite tries the great challenge, which can already count on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for equivalent Word writing video; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for rival PowerPoint presentations;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on the databases; finally Drwa is the graphical module.
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl also, it's positive, it's the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: he is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the website of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26 years old, Kohl was the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the third-generation Epo, after the Italians Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests performed on Kohl test pieces are among those performed in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity of Cera, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.

IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES IS ASKED IF THE ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as Emigrant Countries has recently become a preferred destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
Would it turn the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is all about, which has dedicated a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "north paradox": the northern regions are both those where we register" more integration and more work", but also" a strong anti-immigrant feeling of the country and the most important support for the North League"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the intolerance episodes of Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature required by the League to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegals is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Trend highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Student victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
Student rental market doesn't know a crisis
According to the latest investigation by the Sunia, the tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that the families of origin must support- explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the high demand on the part of the students has so distorted the market that a process of general increase has begun even for the residents.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free-type contracts, unregistered contracts, no rent limit, sub-locations.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of tax taxation are necessary to calm the prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, it goes from 650 euros minimum (Black Band area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, one bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, one room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double bed, and from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), we ask about 600 euros for a simple one, 450 for a bed in a double one.
A slightly lower value (550 euro for a single one) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you step away in the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a single one in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, we spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the zones Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for a bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 euros for a simple one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rents are often taken by extra community students, there is a subsequent anomaly: the rent applied to foreign students is increased by 25/30 % compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, cities eliminate historic halls.
Historical cinemas close in favor of the Multiplexs.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centers, but also in the cities of province,
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of the large multi-salles, and the death of consumption of mono-salles in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and indisputable; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and charged with memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a bit of a path and so many emotions" observes the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, and that told the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia of a way to live the cinema, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of merchants, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and it is the halls of the main cities that paid mainly the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine is in the lead with 82 mono cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multisalle cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally" notes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a firm room in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of deliberation of credit for traders: the historical debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between €16 million and €18 million per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote mono-room cinemas in historical and peripheral centres.
Among the regulations provided for, there are measures of tax facilities for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted area, and will have special rates for parking and certain parking spaces.
"It is an initiative that I am pleased to see" observes Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is clear, however, that, in order to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closing of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New cinema Paradiso" to which I had already thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have experienced so much shared emotions, I turn from the other side to not see the panels darkened by the dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the City Hall's choices to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
heavy charges are brought by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, to the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The sleeves also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his small son lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already condemned for association of mafia-type evildoers, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all common sense," the prosecutors wrote, "the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with Master Piromalli.
"Thus the clan - the judges write - would have been granted to formally enter the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and orientation of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the Andrangheta, heroes who are honest."
This morning's arrests follow last July's arrests, after which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalli clan.
As early as the end of April, Gioia Tauro's municipal council had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local government, local politicians had been discharged from their role of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, was appointed leader of a right centre coalition after the May 2006 bombing.
He shouted at the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the vice minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of having handled everything on a political issue, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromalli clan had even managed to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm write, "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a more known group, close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born from waves, now the bigs are starting.
This is a vast deposit that occupies more than 70% of the world's surface and now the world's largest energy companies are discovering it.
Vagues, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colosses like Chevron have laid their eyes, and now try to get their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has now been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil dropped around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give the sector a big boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the global electricity requirement could be covered by sea swell operating systems.
This amount would be twice as much as that produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides..
Colosseum to attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy was the Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an installation in northern Portugal.
When the deal was announced, it would have been a real revolutionary step.
Two years after that, more and more of these companies, which have always been dedicated to traditional energy, rely on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," said the spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil colossal, the Wall Street Journal, "and she assesses the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question involves obtaining a deliberate permit from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that precisely in Alaska, the US continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for further excavations
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which travel along the sea's energy path, and the amounts invested to date, although their details are not known, indicate an increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its early stages, apart from the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
Currently, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to create a major problem for the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, technologies with a higher environmental impact must be used.
And choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which moves the mud upwards and downwards, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine that, in turn, feeds a generator.
Energy is sent to the shore through underwater cables.
For the time being, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a shopping center and a parking lot using six marine turbines from the East River of New York.
The movement of water during the tides, turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant has announced to have a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electrical Energy, deserves the potential of tides at this time.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable of wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on the energy of tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others, look to the coast, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and previews investments up to 35 million in 2009.
