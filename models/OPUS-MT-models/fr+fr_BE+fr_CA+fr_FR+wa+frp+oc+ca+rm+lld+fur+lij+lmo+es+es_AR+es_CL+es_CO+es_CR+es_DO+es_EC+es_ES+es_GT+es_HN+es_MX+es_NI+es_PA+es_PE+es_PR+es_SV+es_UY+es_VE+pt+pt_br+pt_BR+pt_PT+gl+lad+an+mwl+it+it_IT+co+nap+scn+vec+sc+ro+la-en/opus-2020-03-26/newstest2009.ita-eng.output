The Prague Stock Exchange at the closure of the market had a negative collapse.
After the morning crash, the Prague Stock Exchange restored losses.
The transactions of the CEZ shares have reached almost half of the daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this downside is the collapse of the Wall Street stock.
So, also from us, there is a market reaction to the outcome of the House of Representatives vote in America, which refused to support the stabilization plan for the local financial sector.
Action collapse in Asia
Tuesday the Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indices, however, during the day subsequently erased part of the losses.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day deleted almost 4%, but later also some of the losses stabilized at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the Chinese stock movement at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Shares at the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but in the end losses were 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect the financial markets around the world," noted the head of the Hong Kong Currency office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages financial policy on its own, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian premier Kevin Rudd, should return quickly to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries will also suffer consequences.
U.S. actions are being destroyed
The US Parliament rejected the financial system's support plan on Monday, for which $700 billion (almost 12 billion Czech kroner) had to be allocated.
The legislators have thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
The American actions Monday experienced a massacre and the main indices of the actions recorded the biggest collapse since more than twenty years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7% and a similar drop was last observed in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it fell free.
Congress has yielded: the US government can make $700 billion available to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
American legislators broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the American financial system for a total of $700 million (almost twelve billion crowns).
But it's not said yet.
Congress representatives must therefore define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
Sunday he told the agency Reuters, the chairman of the banking and financial services committee of room Barney Frank.
In the Senate, according to some sources, one could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economists, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening the financial markets.
Thereafter, however, there will be a return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, the aid of the markets can be achieved.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward."
"We have clarified our different views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilisation package," said Democratic Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday .
The legislators' delegates met the night between Saturday and Sunday with American finance minister Henry Paulson, to give final shape to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead to serious losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are in the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market."
"It is necessary to carry on the recovery plan, but I think we are here," Paulson said.
The Asian Trade Signal
The global financial crisis is heavily on the markets for actions that are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement at Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trade in Asian financial markets, which are, in time, the first to influence Monday's market as a result of Congress' decision.
But for now it is definitely not clear when the two Chambers of the American Congress will vote the law and even if the negotiations can stop at the last moment on some problem.
The legislators hope it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount planned for support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush requested.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum in case it will have the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the 350 finals.
Bush appreciated progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may overwhelm his right to veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has remained, i.e. to obtain the finances to buy the passive mortgage values, whose price has fallen due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the Sunday law and the Senate Monday," as the Republican senator mentioned.
The American President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush is pleased with Saturday's positive development and appreciates "the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold parachutes
The chairman of the banking committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the main spokesman, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget of reductions, the fractionation of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called gold parachutes for the managers of the companies participating in the program and is creating a committee that will monitor the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have made a great step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan counts on helping homeowners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage rates that it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly charges on debt rates and allow it to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And that is because we do not know how and for what price the problematic assets will be bought
This will be decisive for how losses will be divided between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz website.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"Most importantly, it is already this week that congressional representatives agree on the support of this plan and that they will baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is now more important, "Marek stressed.
Last blood duel: MP3 players against mobile phones
We'll recommend how to choose
While almost every phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
From this it is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons why an independent reader should be obtained.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy yourself an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this there is not even an objective reason.
However, if you have a hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyl on your shelves, you will at least dream of it.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For some it can be unacceptable to spend on an 8 thousand crown reader, as well as a Pink Floyd fan perhaps hardly digests the headphones from twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
To decide is the duration of the batteries.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just read music, but they don't even make cell phones by mistake.
There is no other existing device as universal as the mobile phone.
Alongside primary functions, calling and texting, you can read music and video, record both and have a camera, sometimes better at times worse and maybe even surf.
And if we consider smartphones and palmars you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle that no refrigerator can do the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, and first the indicator on your screen will require the charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few mobile phones can read music for more than twelve hours, only, and much less.
In this sense, music readers (especially the simpler ones) are much more effective.
With regard to uncounted economic mobile phones that can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, get to work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours with continuous functionality with a charge.
A further problem exists when you download music into your cell phone.
Unfortunately only a limited part of devices has the universal USB port and in addition not all can be connected to the computer without a special software.
Of course the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except for some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with the music via USB from the computer.
Most of the mobile phones and readers are created by themselves a multimedia library arranged according to the names of the performers, the name of the album, gender or the user's classification.
Some devices reproduce only the tree structure of folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When you choose a particular device you are particularly interested in the resistance of the battery, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and clearly the ease of use.
If you need music in the background and if you listen to it every day just briefly on the tram you need a mobile phone that reads MP3.
This can happen now, clearly to any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about which cell phone or reader they recognize.
MP3 players support them all, the overall majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most popular, the total majority of devices support WMA format music.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its Ipods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet network, the operator's corresponding pages (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic to buy a mobile reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and is usually limited only to a hit of the moment of the radio.
Prices aren't very low.
But it is generally assumed that this mode of sale of music (either via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always take their cell phone back.
Anyone who wants to listen to some fruit in their pocket while the MP3 player remains forgotten at home.
It also depends on this, however, if you always carry behind the headphones or at least the wireless earpiece.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every mobile phone, but only a small part of MP3 players has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheaper ones usually cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entry for the common headphones.
The best and from a technical point of view, and also with a 3.5 mm socket for the common headphones, cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead, the advantage of readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest ones not necessarily more economical (see our choice) really makes it possible for anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling for a time with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of wrongly hitting the launch of the mobile internet network and consequently a giant newsletter for data transmission.
Which device to take
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, they are included in the 2 000 crowns.
But be careful
The base models only support cards with the maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones do it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you don't have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you're one of the most demanding listeners, you'll prefer to take specialist mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of the service thus approaches the same MP3 player.
In this context, Sony Ericsson has made more of its way, which walkman cell phones have the same scale of use as separately sold MP3 players.
The MP3 players of the above brands provide you with the same service and price category up to 4,000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in general up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic already this year.
Maybe.
Perhaps the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer practically all services like their partners in Western Europe.
There is still something missing – a virtual operator who forces traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
The fact that the Czech operators belong to the most beloved in Europe has already written many times on Mobil.cz.
At the end of the day, ČTú also confirmed that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the final steps of the European Commission in the field of regularisation of roaming rates perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high against Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to start the fight.
It may sound absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and highly over 100% coverage.
Instead, mobile telophony operators like to boast that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense he often also emphasizes the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ) , Pavel Dvořák, who in the past has sometimes expressed that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with his own network is no longer likely to have many possibilities. (The rest perhaps it would be difficult to find other frequencies by now).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry into the market of virtual operators has led to a considerable lowering of prices, to which traditional operators would have to react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile into the market, similar voices sounded in Britain like we did.
However, it has been shown that there is a place for such operators and that they can really succeed.
At the end of the day, for example, we must not go too far.
In February this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year this operator managed to win over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group to which in the Czech Republic belongs among other U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete brewing group.
In order to be able to function effectively, many fewer customers than a traditional operator are sufficient.
They are not behind, i.e. relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer calls and SMS at low price, which is often in balance with the supply of the most limited services
For example Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS that cost at least half of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move even the bet on a bet-group not recently.
This operator aims to say specifically about men.
"The real men choose Mobilking operator that they like and that they can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company who produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept can also be affirmed by us in Poland.
He doubted the press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover from the point of view of services is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, mobile network operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there will ever be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not have much expectations.
Mobilking's ignition will happen rather in the other countries of our area," he said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesman for the Penta Financial Group.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very much in favour of this thought.
Rather, they try to do everything because no potential competitors are created.
For some time now it has not hidden its interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And it gets better first.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile network operators.
We have already made progress in the negotiations with some of them," says the spokesman for the Pavel Kaidl Group.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator will probably have to have it by the end of the year.
For now, however, there is an impenetrable wall of silence around its creation.
"At this moment we do not believe that in the Czech market there is room for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," he mentioned in his statement to Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeń of the press section of Telefònika O2.
Other operators are also involved in the specific nature of the Czech market.
T-Mobil's press spokesman Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build".
He adds: "In the T-Mobil network, a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this moment we have already had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered at the horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on reaching its 3G licence applications.
He adds Miroslav Čepický: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
Let us consider this, from the point of view of the customers, the most produced.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
The competent authorities - with the complicit operators
The attitude of mobile telephone operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to lower profits.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The troubles surrounding the creation U:fon testify that when operators care about one thing they can row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure pressed against ČTú during the creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This testifies to public information access from ČTÚ's websites.
But now U:fon itself serves as a topic for which the virtual operator does not accept.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The environment of competition in the mobile telephony market has been greatly enhanced with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Regarding the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would put on him and above all on his high services."
However, the attitude of mobile telephone operators is quite surprising because of the complete lack of interest on the part of the Czech regulatory bodies.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTú which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position with regard to the whole issue.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator had been realized.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers was probably not interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa, from the UOHS External Relations Section, in response to our question.
Such a statement by the operators' representatives may not be surprising.
Instead of the office that has to defend the interests of consumers and, above all, take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, it is more than a delicate business.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "To abroad where virtual operators usually work, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephony services."
But of course the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of UOHS.
Truly shocking in the whole situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question as to whether this is really just a coincidence, is put on its own.
Just as the identical price of petrol for all petrols is certainly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section has found no signs of anti-competitive behaviour about this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it does not have a corresponding responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points .
Of course there is the analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of economic competition the only market.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always necessary the agreement of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has – at the end of the day logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not accept this argument, for UOHS it should be a minimum alert that three mobile operators do so strangely similar.
At the same time the complaints by the interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that during the negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to ČTú in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which UOHS is kept out of the whole thing.
This has already been found in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to promote the expansion of ČTÚ's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved telecommunications law has been updated, despite the fact that many experts expected the improvement of the situation from this point of view.
This is what UOHS representatives need to know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
It can be done when no one looks
While the functioning of such pseudo-virtual operators, some of which exist in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their price lists of mobile telephone services that are only partially public.
These are usually multilevel marketing companies.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the specified persons.
The magic lies in the fact that the company against the operator is a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile telephone operators prohibit a similar pre-sale.
"If there were any cases that you are talking about, which we will be interested in, it could be a breach of contractual conditions, and it could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company," replied Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile telephone operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned above, it can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
From the activity of these companies they derive a non-indifferent profit and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculations, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot dispose in full of it as the usual customers of mobile phone operators "
But this should be a little strange at the ČTú.
In addition, there is another question for UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why are they blocking the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not want to be satisfied with the explanation of operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile telephony market has led to a significant lowering of prices for services.
At the same time, virtually all the countries where operators were born, traditional operators were trying more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small market, too saturated limit, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in the developed countries precisely in these cases the governing bodies have intervened in defence not of mobile telephone operators but of their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then came the creation of the first virtual operator and he received others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory organs throw each other the whole case as a boiling potato.
For our experience, we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of competence in these cases makes it more than comfortable.
But we don't throw away the sponge.
If the backstage information is right and the virtual operator will really appear to us soon, the Czech mobile phone market will get back on the move.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only hardly UOHS could remain impassable to the rejection (discrimination) of the other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented in a solemn manner the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde Domov måj".
The new recording of the hymn was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four available versions – solo with male or female voice, choir step and instrumental editing.
The song is under the direction of Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Authors of the hymn reviews are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz site you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
He has already told the radio "Český rozhlas" that he has chosen specifically to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to take care that both and also the choir, have the clear diction, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony" he reported.
Then the national anthem will celebrate next year the 175th anniversary.
The song "Kde Domov mūj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divad it in the original work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by František Škroupa.
He bought popularity and people spontaneously made it his own.
The first verse of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
Wednesday MHD Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers who instead of the paper ticket will have an electronic card will come up in the metro, tram and bus.
At this time, they can provide it with about one hundred thousand people who own their own Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the 30- and 90-day and annual one (which will start from the first January 2009) and at the same time be charged their card in the Infopoints and offices of the Transport Company and at the metro stop Muzeum, Městek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letñany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The cutlery can already be purchased from yesterday on the web page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who start using the Internet service can completely forget the doors at the metro stops where so far they had to make long files for paper tickets.
The cutting is bought online and on the Opencard it is recharged on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places the passengers have at their disposal a desk with personnel format that will help those interested in buying on the internet and will also record on their card the credit acquired." said the spokesman of the project Martin Opartrný.
In addition to the libraries it will be possible to load the electronic cutters on the Opencard in ATM and selfservice that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
What are these ATMs like?
They are red, similar to ticket obliterators, and passengers have already noticed them at Roztyly metro stops, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five of them all over the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný concluded.
The cutting will be checked instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work tomorrow is very simple.
Simply insert the Opencard card and after payment of the cutting, it will load on it.
The electronic cards have been valid since tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of the Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added in the integrated transports of Prague there are controllers equipped with readers of the cards with which they verify the temporal and zonal validity," explained how Filip tickets are controlled by the Ropid organization, which develops the schedules of the collective transports of Prague.
Urban buses have card readers integrated into the driver's box.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at the determined point next to the case.
So the driver checks the validity of the loaded trimmers.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded cutters, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take urban buses and will not remember, when the validity of the cutting expires, can again go to self-service ATMs, where they charge the cutters on the paper.
Here you will see the information about the validity of their documents on the screen of the device.
The Germans of the South wanted a referendum from the USA
The Germans of the South in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This is the result of the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, according to what is said, some groups of Germans in the South turned to the president of the United States in 1945.
This is more than anything from the letter stored in a private archive and now deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow again the return of the "district of Šumava" – occupied by Hitler according to the agreement of Monaco – to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and want to be sure of the promises that American units come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," he writes in the letter signed with the words "People who care for the destiny of Šumava with all their heart".
Because, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans of the South-East only hope for brutality, lack of respect, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to assume the protectorate on Šumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, that oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has not contributed at all, for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," writes the letter.
The reason why authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of thirst for revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States were to doubt the German belief in Šumava, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the district on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or live under the control of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the history of the post-war period, according to some witnesses it describes in an appropriate way the expectations of the Germans of the South.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least realize that it would have been their move from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the peoples of the South.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budějovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp in Holštýn, the tens of other Czech Germans went to find him so that he could teach him the Czech.
"These believed that once they returned home the Czech would make him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia, took the lead in the war, said he was counting on the fact that on the basis of Beneš' decrees they would be moved by the Republic.
You don't think you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so we could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Åebíček's office is expected to discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol to the steering wheel.
And remind him to put his belt on before he leaves.
He wants to touch in the consciousness especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not last professional drivers.
What's it gonna look like in the spots?
Especially stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this also bears witness to the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think you'll pay!
The word "do not think" is written capital on the plate.
And in a pool of blood there's the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his or her life.
The spots will "scatter" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with dramatic scenes of accident victims can be seen commonly.
He thus promises to lower the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrots and sticks for drivers
"With drivers the carrot and stick system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of a fine or an accident.
We must remember the risk to the drivers, " says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of the hospital Na Homolce.
And so we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels warning the drivers of danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel warning of danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and the drivers will not pay any more attention to it," Kořán warns.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The prime minister of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert spoke for the return of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, that is also the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue that he published Monday, the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will have to return almost all the areas (occupied), if not all of them," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"We will have a certain percentage of these territories, but to the Palestinians we will have to leave the same percentage (Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the eventual return would also include East Jerusalem .
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the raiders to pass on to him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in a flash at the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of injured people.
According to the premier it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which are within the Old City. .
"He who wishes to maintain Israel's sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he also stressed.
The retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert has also spoken for the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, that is, according to him the indispensable condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get Golan's heights.
They will have to give up the current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollahs (the movement of the Shiites); they will have to give up the permanent support, which they offer to the terrorism of Hamas, (the movement of the Shiites) of Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," the premier said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards illegal in buses?
The law doesn't recognize them, you can't walk on the bus that takes long distances
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the bus company Student Agency came out the question whether the stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the activity of the steward is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
Last week's accident with which a 22.-year-old hostess lost his life was caused by a truck that cut the road to the coach.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place of the coach, although there were still two other seats assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or stop abruptly even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
Depends on whether or not the bus is equipped with standing places according to the traffic book.
If passengers are not approved, they must be seated.
Student Agency buses have no standing, confirmed it to Aktuáln.cz website the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"We assessed this with the Ministry and at the beginning did not allow passengers to move on the bus.
It was then revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned place," he expressed his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role."
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from performing the services.
The law of road traffic recognizes only the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds less clearly the spokesman Hanzelka.
The Director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes, however, that the law deals with this problem enough.
Depends on whether the bus has approved standing positions.
That's all," he says.
It categorizes buses in urban areas where there are the standing places and the maximum speed limited, interurban with standing places with higher mass speed and long traffic without the standing places with the maximum allowed speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says the expert.
The expert BESIP on road safety Jaroslav Hořín does not find the fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet race there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on planes.
It's not even safe there when a turbulence comes and the flight attendant can kick his head."
"If the bus makes a sudden stop obviously the laws of physics are valid.
Just like in the urban bus or on the tram.
The shipping company has to solve the safety of the stewards with an internal regulation," she also says and understands that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of stewards..
This takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director considers their job dangerous.
"As soon as I have the feeling of having to consider the steward's profession as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they leave.
It would also reduce expenses," he says.
Asian director Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency, motivated the absence of stewards on his means as an interest in security.
"We have no hostess, we are already opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident," said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
An immense tragedy has taken place.
In the incident of the line for Naples a young hostess of the region of Plzeÿ died, who had worked for the company two years.
A Slovenian truck probably came out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The driver of the coach tried to avoid it with a sudden maneuver, but hit it with the right front.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewarts had been occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these places in long-haul buses, they are inaccessible."
The company has in mind to report the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the Court's judgment to pay the damages to the girl's family, but a financial compensation is expected from the offender.
The review of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to clarification of the movement of stewarts on board buses.
"They did not achieve any concrete results, however.
They do not consider them so much the buses, they take care more of the system at score, maximum speed on the highway and use of the phone during driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the activity of stewarts as a major threat to passenger safety," concluded the spokesman Havelka, who said that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
Düsseldorf's hopes point to Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the WestLB director addressed to the house employees.
In the letter published Monday that could form "the center of the capital market of the financial group of savings banks" through the meeting of units of the banking institute of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
The West LB would launch "a competent block" with lasting profits in such a company.
Moreover, any such union could be a decisive step towards further links in the Lander banking sector.
This is how it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because WestLB's affluent is still under heavy pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU commission, but also through the National Authority for the Financial Supervision Service, having pointed out time ago to the regional government of Northern Rhineland - Westphalia that time binds in search of a future solution.
The links between Deka-Bank, which the same clients of the Savings Bank because of their investment funds already know, and WestLB has certainly been talking about for a while, even from Frankfurt.
He reported at the end of August the head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas on the presentation of the first half of the year's turnover that a merger of the house at via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, Deka's managing director, who is half driven by regional banks and savings bank consortia, delegated the board of directors to conduct discussions with West LB on common contracts.
These could be market negotiations or parts thereof.
But the talks have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
Della Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the most important in the business square in Frankfurt, not to mention the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings box sector.
In 2003, for a short period, it seemed that Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
There was nothing done about this three-way association.
As soon as the projects were published, the Asian regional bank was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank instead went to the Baden-Württemberg regional bank in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always thought about a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end Günther Merl, president of Helaba's board of directors, spoke against design games to meet with his home.
Apart from this, it seems that knowledge is created, that it is necessary to bring the different houses of the public sector closer together.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, there could first be a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of the Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba it is not entirely good news.
If it increases the pressure for other mergers, the partners will soon be missing.
In the South now there would be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than the houses in Monaco and Stuttgart.
The association of the Asia-Turingian savings banks that participates with 85% of Helaba, has put the chain to the meeting with WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how to match the different business models of individual houses.
In June Merl pointed out that to the decisive question, with which business model the future of regional banks would be assured, a response from the German savings banks association would not have been given yet.
In the end the division of the West LB, which by that of course is not desired, could also come out.
Thus the letter of the board of directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the consolidation of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer party is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it's the first time while for Luca it's the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them next to the barrel of 5l. of the Kaiser brand stands a massive bearded and shows about 200 travelers what are the deep tones that can produce from the throat.
Elena first from Luca a pack and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, four riders leaving this evening at 23.45 with destination Monaco, Festa della Birra" , expected arrival at 6.30 a.m.
Three couriers are mainly reserved for Italians, in another only Brazilian travel.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so noisy, says Marco, that it's not for Italians.
Marco who wears a long coat with fake fur lining and a pair of glasses with silver-plated broads belong to him buses.
They've been going to Oktoberfest for five years, this year it's three tours.
The night ride, the day off at the party, back at 10:30.
To spend the night would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the beer Kaiser, made according to the rules of Bavarian authenticity, the sickness fund and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave at the time of the Brennero.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better that way, they'll still need their strength.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian plates on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco's group arrives at 6.30 in the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left there is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tendon it means running!", quotes Marco of the first morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, but we block, and not all the yellow bells sitting on the same benches, divide into the adjacent space!"
The mouthpiece costs 8.25 Euro, screams Marco.
And don't forget to tip it.
"Demonstrate at the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "We meet again here at 22:30! Do you understand?"
She's already leaving for the party.
On the street one attacks as follows the yellow bells to the trees, to the road signs and even to an advertising poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as the "Fine Week of Italians".
The exact figures do not exist, we speak of 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is argued that 10% of the visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police in Monaco are strengthened with 7 agents of South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where Italians are in the first place with 200 medical treatments in front of the English (about 60 medical treatments) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the tent of Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sound nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, said Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned, that the German banking sector is not spared by critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate financier Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, gets from a consortium of German banks a billionaire credit, in order to be able to protect themselves from turbulence on the markets.
An experienced person told Reuters on Monday, support credits would reach up to €35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest for the requested part.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
At the bottom are the losses of the Depfa affiliate.
The state financer according to a newspaper article has been refinanced in very short term – which is no longer possible because of the mistrust on the markets.
In the first half of 2008 the bank's reserves had fallen by 95% from EUR 2.37 million, even the share of own capital has yielded from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs had fallen to 0 compared to last year, profits from both increases in demand and certain shares in the liquidation of provisions in loans have fallen by more than 70% over the 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher income from the return of subordinate compensation costs that come both from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the reimbursement of interest according to the single text of tax laws and from business management for business consortia, the negative profit was rather moderate with about 16%.
The former public financier after having been privatized in 1990 had lost himself in speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were disowned in the Areal Bank.
As income in the classic state financing was too low, Depfa has become more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private and state investors (PPPs) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate must now amortize the affiliate's value, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is, the dividends have been canceled.
Already in 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Depfa is an important State and infrastructure financier.
It is more dependent on market refinancing between banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customer trusts.
Because of the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of loans between banks largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually needs for part of the Depfa's credit portfolio – about 50 mld. – in the short term the means of refinancing.
In the opinion of the Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial needs were covered by credit for a certain period and the company protected by the influence of the mostly non-functional international monetary markets.
From other sources it is felt, that thanks to the money the refinancing is ensured until the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE Chairman Georg Funke said that the HRE Group will not need monetary markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) are based on the fact that the HRE Group's marketability is still assured.
This is hoped for by the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
Funding may not be fully used.
But also the opposite is not to be excluded.
After Sunday night the bank learned it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the souls.
The share price drops by 75% on the €3.30.
They're pretty good at loan courses.
While the prior-grade debts are almost unremovable, they yield the courses of deferred credits.
In particular, the loans of the affiliate Württemberg-Hypo are the ones that include the decurrences that expire beyond 2009.
First the HRE loans seemed to be speculative alternative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, that with the relief of the Depfa the crisis has happened, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Until the central banks, governments and the least damaged banks are still ready, an amortization of the annuality can be counted on by the deadline.
Or it comes into play, what no one dares to hope for – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But with regard to the information reversed because of the partial statelizations, the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
In particular, it will create long-term investors a few sound nights with the decision if they share their commitments.
Short-term investors can bring to a conclusion the carry-over of losses for future payouts of the surplus-compensatory tax.
Sylvana and the secrets of Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, the first day of school should come to Tachibana Highschool, the girls start to think again: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new Exchange Log tells of Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I was pretty sure I'd go to school.
I live at the edges of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
The road I had to find myself alone and luckily I didn't miss.
The beginning of the first hour of class does not seem to have been fixed just as we did in Lower Saxony.
The pupils arrive flat from 8 a.m. until at 8.40 a brief interview with the teacher, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson began, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who's happy talking in front of people, plus a 40-school class.
Since I didn't have my school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from the host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this I stood in front of the chair and tried to pronounce well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate in a week my birthday.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, looked up and made a mark, and I heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I already knew this from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "baby, sweet".
Then I ran fast to my place.
The girl next to me grinned, for her it was an honor to sit next to a student exchange
The rest of the lesson time had continued quietly, but when the gong rang, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
They all spoke disorderly and looked back and dried me up with questions – then it's really hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
In the pause everyone opened their Blessing.
My host mother also made me the lunch basket- is different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some kind of wraps with meat and tofu..
To tell you the truth, I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new taste.
Done is, that everything is really good.
Maybe except for the plums put under salt, brrr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a self-made Blessing, prepared quite artistically, with the hope then of getting to know the boy during the recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm really curious if you can find out.
"Why Japan?" asked my friends when I told them that I would have wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I've always said:
"Why fascinate me"
Finally, I have been reading Mangas for years now.
And to better understand the comics and culture they contain, sooner or later I started learning Japanese.
I was completely convinced to come once.
I'm also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They keep us here a lot.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and latest trends - on the opposite side: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is organized well, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen in my life."
1. Even rats have feelings
A rat or a cockroach run away when they feel danger.
Neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: also many animals have feelings.
4. But how could it be verified whether, when they behave in the same way, they have the same feelings as we do?
In the Internet newspaper "Edge" for some years, articles from well-known scientists are published.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents selected answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else so far being able to prove it, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter an impatiable territory, because the base of reference does not match.
When a rat finds himself in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that other animals do too. That is, he pretends to be dead, runs away or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe this.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult for us to convey our feelings towards animals.
On the one hand it often connects the lateral prefrontal cortex with human awareness, the associated circuits (this for its direct sharing with the brief memory and the executive and control functions).
In man this vast area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, we thus admit the foundation on the assumption that man even differs from other primates.
Another dramatic feature should appear in the way of man's speech: since a large part of life is linked to the language, it is often said that it is linked to the consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the awareness of the animal, as it is done, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through its own experience due to the special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which for science it would be easier to have access.
We could analyze the processes of animal consciousness without regard to their contents, and precisely this happens in studies on the short memory of primates, in particular the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch und Francis Crick follow, it passes first to the neural correlations of consciousness that to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal bark for the implementation of the display.
What, then, is outlined for feelings?
I impute them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of his conscious brain activities.
What we indicate as "paura" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as body reactions) occupies the working memory.
In this way the feelings are closely connected to the regions of the bark, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With the speaking nature we create subtle nuances of feeling, because we with the help of words and grammar can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Compared to this Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings are the most primitive activity of the regions of the body of the sensations of the bark and the cephalus paleo, similar to Jack Pankseep, who has, however, focused more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I think it is indisputable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear for rats and humans is likely to be felt this way in both cases: but how could it occur, if rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
Does a cockroach in case of danger run away as if he felt the fear?
In my view, the simple similarity of behavior cannot yet prove any vital similarity.
That is, neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and humans have similar paleoencephalic, scarabs not even a brain.
But is paleoencephalus responsible for feelings?
And when you could even prove it to humans: how would you want to prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress here at the neural level, provided that the same procedure is abandoned for rats and men.
Since I don't do research on language and conscience in rats, so I don't do research on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered to be shortsighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continually battling against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotional.
UEFA President Platini: referral to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of the Uefa in Bordeaux as a demonstration of trust in Ukraine and in its ability to organize Europe with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"However, this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries"
Both home-owner countries mock in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stages for Europeans will even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at the highest speed," said Ukrainian association president Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us constantly"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the management of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the national Olympic committee and replaced with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslav Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki said to the Polish information agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Many exhibitors of the first division only in the last season were condemned for manipulation, in the end the beginning of the League had to be postponed to the last moment.
Dennis Quaid fights outraged
He wanted to promote a new film, in the interview he talked about the private and now he has money with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared his former Dennis Quaid adulterous.
He foams of anger and fights.
Late Roses War for the former couple of married Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their separation the two Hollywood actors are now arguing with each other a bad fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was long unfaithful to me, and this was very painful."
The extent of the betrayals she would have come to know only after the separation.
The opportunity for the "soul stripping" was the work with Ryan's press for his new film "The Women" – the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his publicly declared adulterous husband was clear: it would be "unaudited," said the fifty-four-year-old at the "New York Daily News", which "Meg for the same time repeats and reworks the history of our relationship".
It would also be "deplorable" that Jack, the sixteen-year-old son they had together, again "remember publicly the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from separation lives alone, Quaid is married again and soon becomes the father of twins.
And so his judgments are closed with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I consider myself fortunate to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best."
Prices for airline tickets and hotels are closed
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be even up to 50% cheaper
Flights and overnight stays at the hotel have become more convenient again - this is the result of a study of the financial provider and American Express travel.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter it observed an evident decrease in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would be in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees as a reason why the dollar's weak quotation, which would lead to a "warming desire to travel by American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession in hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
Also with regard to flight prices, the trend in the first quarter is still upwards:
Due to the increase of the kerosene the passengers of the Economy Class had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, long-range fuel intensive flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, Economy Class's air ticket prices fell by an average of 12,5 % compared to the previous quarter, in the first class and in Business, however, price changes were much weaker.
In Germany Prices have fallen even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose by 11,9 %, in the second quarter they fell by 23,6 %.
As for internal German flights according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the price collapse would be on the one hand economic growth downwards, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market has collapsed.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition from the open skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe.
A sign of the critical situation would be the abolition of non-profit routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that would have declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – only in Europe were 24 airlines.
The HSV beats the Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a goal and simple methods, the SV of Hamburg becomes a capolist.
At Borussia Luhukay he still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Kristoffer Klein here makes the landing of luck worse for the national player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player first came in late in the game and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was precisely formulated, passing on his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hall of the Hamburg arena cabins.
It didn't happen much in the catacombs, the play break was over and most of it was sitting back in their place.
Rieger has been for almost 3 decades a physiotherapist of the HSV, enjoying an even greater estimate than some old players.
And so his motto also found listening in the high spheres.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol has annihilated and raised his thumb as a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of the Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded in a similar way: here's the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have "wanted more relaxed".
For 1 to zero those in Hamburg must thank for the blow to the mark of Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that many weak players in Gladbach could not hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty win," said Martin Jol.
The SV in Hamburg this Monday will be 121 years old.
The spectators have already celebrated before, on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing classification on the video screen, which legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We can fix everything," said Marcell Jansen.
It has the feeling that the provisional table certificate is more indicative of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new late arrivals – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric door as well as Jansen blown to FC Bayern – finds itself slowly, but has not yet been able to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," Jol re-launches.
After the defeat of the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to collapse temporarily by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of one day of its history.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einsteins' general theory of relativity might not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the quick-frozen fuel pipes, it is now up to her to freeze death.
Among scientists for years, a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion – the anomaly of the Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they get additional momentum/spint/ swing in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical expedient as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What amazes scholars for years now: rockets do not behave completely as expected according to the law on gravity.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, might not be entirely exact.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the Swing-by anomaly through the so-called dark matter that astronomers saw in the cosmos.
"Manager of the anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Of the existence of dark matter space scholars have only known for about 10 years.
A force of attraction emerges from her, whose effect on other celestial bodies is clearly shown.
Instead, she herself is completely invisible, i.e. she does not send or reflect any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter constitutes at least a good fifth of the whole mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers tourists kidnapped in Egypt would again be free, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros in ransom.
In a shooting before the release 6 kidnappers turned out to have been killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The negotiations for the ransom are already under way.
The Germans are always in the eyes of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was consistent with Egyptian state television, Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the chronicle of the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released
We are examining their state of health," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 members of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The rear scenes of a shooting that took place prior to the release of the hostages remain unclear: so the kidnappers after the instructions of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready for the end of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them by surprise.
"The problem had been solved.
They agreed on a ransom," the official said.
It would have "still tried to take over the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had killed 6 of the kidnappers by gunfire and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had claimed from Germany a ransom of EUR 6 million; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release women hostage after the ransom was paid.
The men should have been held until the kidnappers had had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused a position on the report .
The abuse of the stepfather "has led to suicide"
Years of abuse on the part of the stepfather led a woman to kill herself, said a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stitians, Cornwall, was in prison for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Miss Randle had killed herself in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a little girl and lived in Coventry, Trerise molested her and bandaged her before she had sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
Her stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Public Minister Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, was "emotionally dead," and that she had "molten with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
You think she killed herself suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended, "I tied her up and bandaged her."
"I didn't sexually molest her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "She is an extremely strange fetishist, and for her victim it must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his life away.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn't, it would have been hard for the facts to end up in court."
I notice the effects Stephanie's father and mother described on their daughter these years.
"Otherwise, she was clearly likely to have been a promising and happy young woman of success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office officer who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged with the official secrets act, the BBC learned.
The man was in transfer from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least sensitive of the allegations made under this law and there is nothing suggesting a criminal attempt.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They would have thought that this was being dealt with internally at the Mod and the Office of the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be charged by the metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction company deals with B&B account
British construction companies could face an account of over £800,000 after the bailout of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has given 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take the money from the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "irritating" that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of £14 billion will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley loans are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid annually to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that every company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the construction company association, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the recovering market are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options are there to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account," said Mr. Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk goes up to 5 penny a liter
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of its milk for an extra five penny per liter from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two pennys in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide for themselves whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Refusal of bail to former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court in Bangladesh refused a request for bail from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that you could be arrested when you return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him a bail for having exempted 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was a member of parliament
The case is one of many allegations of corruption against you.
Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival Khaleda Zia had been released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh of Sheikh Hasina is scheduled for the coming weeks but his party, Awami League, has asked that the temporary government of the country supported by the military first give her full freedom.
The correspondents say that while you were going abroad for medical treatment on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of your release, if you can remain free when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say that he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court's order.
"The High Court has refused the request for bail for Sheikh Hasina stating that she cannot have bail since she is already abroad on the word for medical treatment," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall file an appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
She is expecting the return home of Sheikh Hasina after October 17, said Sunday a senior leader of the Awami League party.
She was detained last year after the government flanked by the military took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical care.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear of Afghan anti-poly campaign
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The UN carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that he cannot reach the children in the Helmand and Kandahar parts in the south for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said that this is happening despite the Taliban's promises that they would not attack or hinder thousands of people in the staff carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the rival TV station ITV.
BSkyB has been told by the Competition Court of Appeal to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation impeded competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought participation in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB participation in ITV raises doubts about the independence of ITV, causing the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's boss, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stakeholders was unreasonable and disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the US prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Ministry to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The operation took place when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by the fear that the prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal behaviour have not been fully investigated or apprised," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for expired performance.
But later it emerged that the dismissed lawyers had not been assessed more than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in judicial action against Republican members of the high-profile Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute cases on behalf of the government.
They may be fired at any time, but they may not be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for redundancies, and eventually rescheduled his position.
A number of other judicial officers resigned.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical about Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he was primarily responsible for redundancies, that he had given up his role as leader and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officials, including Bush's former senior assistant Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigations.
The episode of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for its epic Bat Out Of Hell anthem.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at the next week's ceremony in London, said he was "honoured" to win the award.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit track of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The Coldplays will lead the nominations for this year's awards, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was made as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached the 15th place.
But the album of Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell remained almost nine years in the standings and came to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngites forced him to cancel the concerts.
He later emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, roads and other crossings, some famous, others merely used.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and long-time residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without making the Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than a busy road.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlante.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include long-time neighbors who say that they were hit by the beaten road simply because it was one of the last remains of the slum of the past.
But the department of preservation and development of the city, which has control of the streets, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Comité pour l'utilisation du terrain du commission communale du circumdaire some representatives of the agency of the city and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the director of the Community Board 3 district.
"There is very little space left at the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There could be proposals to fix and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay many months ago announced that he wanted to reopen the small road and install seating places, including some to use for a coffee to which the real estate company hopes to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renew this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city has suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Preservation Accommodation, said that in fact it was the city's desire to sell the road and pointed out that the purpose of the agency was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to his most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe he took his name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road is perhaps better known as the cover photo set of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The ground was beautiful," said Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of filth, clothes and pieces of casks, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write "gentrification" of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, suggesting that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of city almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Complaints: A Little Nostalgic Look at the City In Extinction"), published part of a Speech from the History of the City that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is an old, unexhausted street, dark even by day and delimited doors of rusty iron warehouses and windows with saracinesche, with weeks-old newspapers rolling along the lowlands."
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran fast through the back of the road near a door that led inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls there were graffiti and a bottle of 22 ounces empty beer lies near a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passersby said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggested that she would need to be a little embellished.
Mr Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks that some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty and disgusting places."
Bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member in California studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
Really attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Obama's campaign notes that, "African-American and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English students.
Yet, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in language classes other than English, does not take into account his interest in filling learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
School students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among the fourth graders, an amazing 100 percent of the students took the higher level test in the 2008 math state exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of the fourth graders did the expert level test on English-language-art.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama's favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes the pace and exercise, constant assessment of skills and an attitude of the "no excuses" type.
Moreover, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the obstructive approach of the school for English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "we had a fantastic success with a student who had just come from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you would not have been able to identify who it was."
"It works," he observed "for us it works."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other schools by the Spanish majority and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevent it from predicting Mr. Obama's response.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama has recently made the subject plain when he said that people should stop worrying about "only-English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps in achievement, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil drops sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the American bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The futures of the rough fell from 7% to $99.80 per barrel at the New York stock exchange in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil on Wall Street, and by several powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 per barrel in June, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before coming back again, in the background of a tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety influenced investors again on Monday even after the congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement on the rescue plan on the weekend, the largest in history.
The news was obscured by the fresh concern that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the weekend's frantic negotiations had led to a rescue agreement " seem to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape from contagion.
From a raw material perspective, our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for the coming year while home oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by about 20% for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a comeback.
"Never seen such a thing," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had evened the grey of the threatening clouds that overshadowed them with a fiasco game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tune made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two other touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I didn't get out of my path," Favre said of all the steps that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication was great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles played catch games, the defense hit Cardinals Kurt Warner's quarterback heavily.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a wandering launch and released it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another ride and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens is forcing a Warner smoker.
The last round, the forced smoker by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals went ahead on that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had resumed the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal, for an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, the coach of the Jets Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets gave 21 points without reply in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter much more than the third."
There have been a lot of points in a small amount of time."
Rested Gebrselassie surpasses his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again because many consider him the best marathon ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin marathon Sunday and becoming the first person to run a race of 26.2 miles under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the race favorably flat at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sends his previous score of 2:03:26, last year in Berlin, in fragments for 27 seconds.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie is developing the 26th world record for such a stunning career that he has produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped Beijing's Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday with an average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half of the founders such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went to long distances, the marathon record fell by more than two minutes in the past decades, since Ronaldo from Brazil's Coast won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had cramps in the flesh and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
It has been somewhat criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Eastern African rival - for having overly orchestrated its races, generally avoiding many of the best marathon stars in the world, relying on apripist as if it were a mid-ground race, and putting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie's skills as marathon.
With the fall of four Kenyans Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie in competition after the openers disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish line, Gebrselassie made a final push to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but she healed to win in Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing good calculations, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a big detachment, taking them back after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the park with extended theme on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendour, the noise, the enormous, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience enter life.
Eatonville, the first black city incorporated in the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, abundance of guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city that has described - and that makes tourists stop including it in the Florida tourist guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted to share their thoughts with the white man, that "knowing so little about us, he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even now, in a year when a Black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening speech on the race, many here remain undefeated from the eyes of the outsider.
"We are very cautious about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the oldest church in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black takeover and a community of almost 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of the rural culture of the blacks of the South - sometimes disdained, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's imagination really started with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere books, rich in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida leadership transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida within a scenario of black history and human drama
Low as a crab in both life and literature, Hurston brought readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Out of the street to the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-maintained gardens and courtyards, to which Howard Miller always cared, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything suitable for passing rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second wedding and sex.
Clearly this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it like she was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls whom Hurston immortalizes by quoting men who sing rough songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned from his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston fell into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that even today boasts of dignified clothing.
Many of the inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were groaning.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, lying on his chair on the patio on the back above Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "he never stayed long".
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books went out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a plaqueless grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no big memorial ceremonies, and no big conference.
"I don't believe they understand his contribution to the world or his leave to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to set up a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult time in his history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had brought an end to its idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the battle on racial mixing brought hatred to the community's home door.
"During that period, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting on the side," says Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who was killed by that once.
They threw a cockroach out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor to my race".
Residents now say that the disintegration of schools, despite being positive in some respects, dilutes Eatonville's cohesion and undermines the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hug your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher-- I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who surpassed prejudices, as she did, with glad self-assurance and lines like: "How can some deny to themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey towards the Hurston's plateless tomb and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Robert E. Hemenway's Hurston hit the shelves of the bookstores, reintegrating it into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as her most famous daughter had again crossed the lights of the turnaround.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began designing a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many come back for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its road project.
"The five lanes of the resurrected highway have brought what would be said high speed, a true pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd makes it easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the image the city has of itself.
Outside cities like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the public historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey bookstore (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repaved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, can give the sensation of a secondary road under the summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s of 1800s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to look for Eatonville's story, for its significance, are often still treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most of the interviews, to some things - such as the murals on Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weak for bright red, still fears that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of civic pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, neither better, nor worse and fair, creative, great worker, silly and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, which he said might need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they just came in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,' said Alondra Kenon after Mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's really a nice city."
Here in New York we all speak fluently of finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newspaper stalls and huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't notice standing in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, nesting bee over their heads bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York live every day the worst "bad day in office" since the fall of 1929.
The factors shake metal carts for the tea through the sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin-Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken stretch shirts hanging to a stick on their shoulders.
The employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It didn't seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings book Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch office, a tail of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's door, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service door, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask directions for the large Macy warehouse and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are before me, I would have learned from Starr, my "banker of trust," were in line for my very reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from smaller banks from places from which commuters do, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took the money from the so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose subsidiaries operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family members.
In past years, 15 of these banks have failed.
Last days the Washington Mutual, a bank with 327 billion dollars in assets, was submitted to the controlled administration, and while the New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend on Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of 440 billion dollars, was looking for a buyer to save her.
The employees and clerks who stood in front of me, scared of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a secure port, the bank that is asking for more bails on Wall Street.
The common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and her exhilarated CEO Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if he was throwing himself at a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the porter in uniform, almost fifty of my condo, has changed the subject of our normal conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expenses.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Desecrated Muslim Tombs while Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "City against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They carry typical road signs representing mosques with a red line passing through the middle.
The police blamed the right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the political parties of the right-wing extreme have earned much in the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The culprits traced Jewish symbols like David's Star spray over some graves, but detectives think it might have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply shocked" by the news of desecration, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious relevance to Muslims.
Austria meanwhile embarked on a spiritual research trip following its right-hand turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that took almost 30 percent of the votes, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with strongly anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against the veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to the foods that are perceived as related to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, suggesting that they are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which established the extreme right as the strongest political bloc in the nation, indicating that the change was led predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
I travel abroad forbade to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of sexual abuse of minors, was banned from travelling to France and Spain from court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he had informed the authorities that they controlled him that he wanted to go to Spain through France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent's police last Thursday after he had provided the magistrates with evidence of Glitter's previous arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadi, was not present at Ashford's pretura hearing in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "Thursday, September 25th, at Ashford's pretura, Kent's police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's foreign trip to France and Spain until March 25th.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the sex offenders' register.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also requested to give the police a seven-day notice of his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they didn't want to discuss Glitter's individual cases or possible movements in the country.
A spokesman for Kent police said: "Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the UK because we have the right complete systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted persons for sexual offences registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have put him through passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the pretura of Uxbridge, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to place him in the register of convicted for sexual offences.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from travelling to France and Spain.
"Photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
Neither heels nor flying nor clothes from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen gaze or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, taking it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day more and more," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" could also be common people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the road" are "artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the public.
To grasp the personality of these greats, you do not need to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are inner.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With the passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers using a ballast camera.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, remember classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects the conception of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, capable of conquering the public with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are featured in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited at the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Veteran athlete portraits" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short time.
I think the portrait is the hardest kind in photography.
You meet or compare with people, characters you sometimes don't even know or give you just a few minutes to take the photo.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at number 20 of via de la Mata, parallel to via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he's writing is a "wrong"
It is set in places that still do not know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is in the grip with a new project to which he is working, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived twenty years in Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Since always favored for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival of Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had common sense, I would not write it, but I will do it equally and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people passing through the city of Aqueduct.
The author of "La cita y los canos" was, as a prognostic, the prominent figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award to be the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens' book "Our Mutual Friend", filled the places of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience whose time flew when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, evoked as he was born the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "to live beyond what I was living"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to supplicate the "lack of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, writing and continuous reworking; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories rest.
The Spanish-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, "it has effects" and that "it makes people more unconformist." For this reason he invited writers to "do not give in to frivolity" and to "take responsibility" for their vocation.
Time hinders the Festival of Pozoblanco, depriving it of the corridors
The celebration of the corridors that should have sealed the days of the Festival of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after the towers selected for the corridors had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather raged against this Festival, preventing us from celebrating two out of three days.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second bullfight.
In the poster were Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who had to face a bull of Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was held regularly only on Friday.
On this occasion was Daniel Luque triumphing, cutting off three ears and being brought out in triumph, after having roasted with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two runners by receiving greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than by virtue of the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing from Los Llanos arena without glory and without sorrow.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutch, he earned the whistles of most of the audience.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish passes the lock place in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
Agents call the two occupants of a van into the alt. Instead of stopping, they run away.
The officers called in the alt to the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping they fled.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The agents after following them, they can arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years of age, identified as A.A.J., according to the statement of the Basque Government Department of Internal Affairs.
The arrested individual is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The accident occurred when some Alava road officials were carrying out a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipality of Armiñon.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, breaking orders, rushed abruptly and went past the lockpoint.
The agents were followed up until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometres, stopped on the edge of the road and its two occupants fled into a wooded area.
The Ertzaintza agents were able to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and took note of once inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish panets, which were at the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for an in-depth investigation and weight detection.
Furthermore, since the officials found that the registration had been "duplicated" because it did not coincide with that in the documentation of the van, the arrest was also charged with the offence of falsification of public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old A.A.J. prisoner was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the next few hours.
Arrested actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effect of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effect of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, according to what was revealed to the magazine People by a spokesperson on the California highway.
The witness specified that around 4.30 p.m. Locklear "kicked the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with sudden maneuvers back and forth. By retromarcating, he passed several times in front of his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first sight, apparently had not recognized the actress, saw Locklear stopping in a nearby street and leaving the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She seemed confused," and for this reason the agents led her to a specialist drug and alcohol centre to undergo a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress has proven to be collaborative and the hypothesis of excess alcohol has been discarded from the beginning, although "according to what the officers observed at first, we believe Locklear was under the effect of some drug."
Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of driving under the effect of some unspecified substance and was imprisoned in the local prison around 19.00, to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was re-established by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being admitted after an episode of anxiety and depression.
Call on the Andalusian Federation of the UI to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of training to take a decision on the case of the former adviser to Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its responsibilities," he said with regard to the resolution that the party will have to adopt with regard to what has until now been a member of the Seville Council.
However, the leader of the UI stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations as to the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to have maximum transparency."
He also stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public offices."
"May Blood", the epic bet by Garci
Inspirating at Episodios Nacionales di Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci reproposes in Sangre de Mayo the famous revolt of the Spaniards against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illust the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría as head of a large cast of performers.
Blood of May, for more than two and a half hours, debuts this Friday in the cinema halls, to become in the future a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this tour "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who had commissioned him from the Community of Madrid three years before turning a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2nd. The director had agreed that the story should be based on the novel Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million budget allocated by the Community of Madrid has represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate scenarios and costumes to portray a "storted Spain that misled the choice of the leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence led to a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII" Garci observed.
However, the director regrets not having received funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los phantas de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de May, so it was not possible to turn some scenes provided by the stage that he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the director of Return to begin, has influenced what is his usual work practice, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before turning along with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work resides in going to theater and cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which he works."
Many of the performers, part of whom are part of the Sangre de Mayo cast, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar for four times - win one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy - his Blood of May, Seven tables de billiard French and, the last selected Los gironasoles blinds - do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "which should instead be known."
From this film Garci no prizes are expected.
"At first you think you work for the posters, then you realize that you work only for prosperity, and at some point you conform to simply turning an extra film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Seville essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Seville dancer pays tribute to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and mother of Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three she moved with her family to London.
She was a dancer of free dance and a specialist in oriental dances.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, the calibre of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me. I looked amazing."
She supports the dancer: "We do not intend to tell her whole life, but to gather her spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested to me some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic," she explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of her shows, as she does in "The Open Door"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been her relief.
"Mattilde interprets Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored about this."
The set-up also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi di Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been dive to all round, and who have always had many spooks."
In the work there is also in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her, because I think she is one of the women who have had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers her and even less regards her work as something of value," Bayon says.
The show will begin today, at 8.30 p.m. at the theatre of Lope de Vega.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poete newly married" closes also the Triennio
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Assassorato alla Cultura della Junta dell'Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennio di Zenobia e Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
Thus, the "Triennio di Zenobia e Juan Ramon" ends with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel house-museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That choir de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Councillor for Culture of the Junta dell'Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the highest-value Andalusian poets.
America likes it a little less without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the disturbing idea that Newman left.
Yet it cost him a lot to give him an Oscar.
And since 2007 he's been retired.
And it was also known that he was very ill.
Despite that, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what a trial goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or overreacting.
A father of cinema and country died at a particularly dark moment, for fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on the ground, in desperate search for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and remain well people to admire, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone he embodied the ideal platonic of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and defeated causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the firstborn deceased of overdose to the creation of the brand of home and organic food.
All gifts to a country to which it is very difficult to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without taking care of nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that a man did not die, ended a time.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, an award-winning director with Oscar, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the height of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has ventured to define Paul Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He left a very high-level example for all of us," notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today is trying to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high consideration the need for uprightness and having a serious private life away from cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful even though he certainly did not lack the opportunity to be.
"Why am I going to eat out of the hamburger today, if I have a steak in my house?" he used to joke.
In heaven is accompanied by the pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Among all the great roles he played, no one was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, eager grandfather and passionate philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the "perfect race," but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, which if they were then taken into account at the time of the evaluation and I had to examine them, would be absolutely negative.
But let's go by order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense started with the dorsal retreat, which assumed he'd go first.
It didn't seem like a wrong idea, but if they force you to go, it's to pull everything back (including the chip to avoid the codes during the race).
No, you don't.
You had to go just to take the back (first foolishness, go only for this) and (after its tail), surprise! they had only "S" size shirts (second foolishness, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis if they decided to buy only small shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like that are harmless compared to the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon to take the chip, the waiting queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race began that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once successful in the company, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which attempts of popular rebellion and assault at the stand were added.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the correct ranking because of the chip that, I suppose, did not register the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this won't fit into my thoughts.
So I think we'll continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented in advance a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a sort of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move inside the company's campus) by assisting the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group those present in conversation groups.
In the example video the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that it does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of society.
She asks if she's there to visit someone and tells her she'll be at her disposal shortly.
Everything without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were equipped with essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for "the least".
All one discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was Google's first step in competing with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same thing as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You only take your computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - and we spend more time daily surfing the network than in a remote window environment.
What is the use of half the applications of the operating system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its services online so that they are a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, in fact, and I bring here a small example.
I took the photo inserted in this post at one of Microsoft's employees' recreation facilities in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the drink machine a sign prompts them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to conduct a network search.
Last week, however, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be placed on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The cell phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried her to the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's Diamond of Blood, as well as Francis Ford Coppola's "Pacino in The Padrino" as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to list the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the forzo with the pointed beaks that lift the weights in the walking circus.
This is basically the typical man's t-shirt, with the inside of cotton, strapped and without sleeves.
It is the tank, as the Anglophones call it, although the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excellent compared to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the shirt carry as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excellent compared to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company does not only concern the famous "tank".
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, sailor shirts, baby dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Today, sisters Cruz took their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they're a lot more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the signature Mango made its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important prizes that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, conquer you quickly.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we designed my sister Penelope and I for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the movies of the '50s and '60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love losing myself in the city and watching as women dress, as they combine and mix their clothes. I do it frequently.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, even if in the end, everything conflues and there are many elements in common.
As a child, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to go through my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I've always paid a lot of attention to dressing.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to class and to the wise, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when they deliver you the wardrobe is the moment when you actually meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for stylists and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, got into a crisis?
No, I don't.
Never felt better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience in savoring life by making less mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I've wanted since I was a little girl, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you're a mother, or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my own body is asking for it, and I also want to be a young mother, and I don't want to lose it.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As far as cinema is concerned, you're waiting to see some films shot last year in different rooms.
That's right, and I really want them to get off.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it cannot always be like this.
I want you to come out "The Last Hour" and "Looking for the Tomb of Christ".
Let's see if you'll like it.
A few days ago you debuted on the runway with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the walkway as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity show for her organization "Women for a better world" and the clothes we have performed – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango - were auctioned to raise funds for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her, that I who have known her for a long time can confirm that I am not so true.
Besides, I find myself with this good part where you're involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to do the pine tree, I would have done it anyway.
If it's to help women in the third world, you can't back off.
Alcoholic reciprocating drivers will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires drivers with three administrative sanctions for excessive alcohol in their blood, to install in their car the system that prevents the driving of the vehicle in a state of drunkenness or if it does not blow in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the Attorney General's Office, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since he will have to attend a road rehabilitation course.
In addition to the Attorney General's Office for Road Safety, this initiative will be attended by the Directorate General for Traffic (DGT) and the Fondazione Tecnologico per la Segurità dell'Automobile (FITSA).
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of the drivers reported more than once for drunk driving then return to driving the car.
The alcoholock would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the breathed air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than that allowed.
The cost is greater than EUR 1000 and would be borne by the sanctioned person.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices allow for a reduction of up to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: to stop these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And in order to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out on an ordinary basis, and without a doubt the necessary reform for criminal proceedings would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been experimentally introduced in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote for an initiative of the PSOE in which it intends to install this system on school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 1740, the second program, the Spanish plane in which the principles of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced to use their hand as a visor to see the real couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that Spanish principles were about to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time... you're from here or...
No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the principles of Asturias are and the importance of travel.
There are many who wait in the airport's hangar crushed to the red carpet and military cordon made up of 27 marine soldiers who offer the greeting of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, hangs in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps told her that in Mexico City she threatened bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before passing in the room where the official committee awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a spirited reporter from Mexican television awaits them.
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, than not Paris and probably there is no more exquisite stylist and bont vivan of Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his drawings in Mango's showcase at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept from the emotion.
Moreover, it is the second largest company store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the stylist Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's most exquisite TVs, Mango's gala presidential table was even more spectacular.
Born, with his heart broken and having needed virtue, due to his brother's recent death, he wore a dress from the House and some ELAH complements to take off the breath and to the arm of his son Luis - a boy of almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the honors of the house and of the knight who ended up, along with Baron Rotchil, without jacket, because they both had given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in trousers and shirt – drawn by her hand – transformed herself for dinner, wearing a very sensual long black dress and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the room for ballet essays and she, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and sketched a "big fold".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the palace, but had shown us first his son's photos on his cell phone.
The next day we rejoiced at the presence of Olivier Martinez – another youngster who moves on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and made sure previously, that there were no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the antistress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And as if that were not enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7, but it's even worse to imagine getting involved in the frenzy dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and computer backache.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one and not two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the struggle to get out of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, a whole "menu" of tailored options for each's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is called "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the bookstores thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to achieve calm in areas such as work or in personal relationships, this "manual" denies that conviction.
It also suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline doesn't already flow into your veins to regain body balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Talk in your sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who speak while remaining asleep.
The first time it happens, at most it takes a scare, but it doesn't really matter much.
This is a benign alteration of sleep defined as sleepiness.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have been told that you have spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example associated with a high fever episode) or with a greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes there are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, night enuresis (to pee in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stress or overcrowded situations.
In any case, it is a phenomenon that has not yet been studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite occurs (scream, scream, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be appropriate to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to see if there are any issues that are generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a relief to the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration, so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (e.g. when coupled with insomnia or stress).
What can be done, however, is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before he goes to sleep.
Propose peaceful games and avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is hard to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the sleepyos appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you would interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking about it, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if it appears very distressed and episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check from where it derives such great anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him for information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he is dreaming to say, so much attention must be paid to the interpretation of the information and to the conclusions to which it may lead.
Never tell the child that you could ask him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
Something like that causes enormous anguish.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illauserrn... finally
The Illhaeusern finally found the way of home victory after a long period of unfruitful.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-Nerians have created the greatest number of networking opportunities by turning one into the victory of the game.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this meeting when the attackers expressed themselves hard.
After a first attempt by the captain of the host team Kauffmann who struck the seven with one shot from afar, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other caused the defense of Dannemarie, Fonderflick from afar, then Hirn high, Romain tip and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block to the center of the camp, leaving only the Riahi chain to the point of attack.
The beginning of the second period was decisive with two initial occasions signed by Riahi and Temporary for the Dannemarie, and immediately after the first Marais network for the Illhaeusern, well positioned, resumed a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illhaeusern gunner will not be able to taste his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But the Dannemarie won't be able to take advantage of it, and it won't cause big problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, untangled just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last few minutes of the game when, after a rocky action, the ball would blow the cross.
Sarkozy meets the fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Brittany.
Before the demonstration of the fishermen who brutally prevented access to several British and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère department on Tuesday morning to enchant the representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that "they would come forward with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the price of diesel, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the spokesman for Elisha David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help companies regain competitiveness and to ensure the working conditions and remuneration of sailors".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stop.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "luma operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of congestion.
Even the port of Quiberon has been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been interrupted.
A roadblock was implemented on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday the sailors have already demonstrated their determination by burning, starting from dawn, tyres and pallets in front of fuel tanks at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while taking marches in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the vessels remained at the dock, or at Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Loire Atlantica, interrupted in the evening the blockade of the famous Total refinery of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide on any actions.
In the Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not give in" et "they will not move to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, for example.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a vessel is reached only with a diesel of less than €0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and still Sam Mendes greeted the legend of film and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecast in 2008
The airline company has 215 deliveries this year, despite the recession threats to the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth worldwide company in the field, maintains delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 planes, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, he delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, in particular for planes of the range between 30 and 120 seats.
So far, Embraer delivered 41 planes to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would yield more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, set up by the American monetary authorities, would yield more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollar loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The IGA is ready to consider the sale of much of its business, in addition to the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and to the United States, specifies the newspaper on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The Board of Directors of the IGA met on Sunday evening to consider any assignments, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at the IGA.
The activities that the AIG intends to divest include the international leasing subsidiary Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of the Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these divestitures, the FT continues.
The IGA must quickly recover liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion granted by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the US authorities impose 80% of its capital.
Paris: Morning Meeting History
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives expressed itself against the Paulson plan for the rescue of financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a drop never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10.365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) higher than that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
Nasdaq, the index of major technological titles, lost 199.61 points by closing to 1.983.73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81 % (or 106.85 points) by closing to 1.106.55, according to the final figures of closure.
Demoralized at the beginning of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan, designed to bring stability back to the markets.
By 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans refused the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"All this points to how much the market counted on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project were actually dying (...) then the witness would soon be handed over to the Fed – Federal Reserve – (the American central bank, ndr) and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, head of finance and economy at the Global Insight.
And still highlighting the state of emergency," every day leading to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, he stressed the Piegza.
After the Washington Mutual failed on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, calling for urgent action in favour of the banks of the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only faced with an American crisis, but with a global crisis," added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury Bonds fell to 3,632%, compared to 3,827% on Friday evening, while the yield of the 10-year Treasury Bonds fell to 4,161%, compared to 4,357% on the previous day.
Obama ahead of the first television duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two White House candidates, here's a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic campaign proclaimed their victory for the television duel, followed by a third of American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although worthy, was not brilliant enough to allow him to stop the fall in polls five weeks from the presidentials.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat had the best.
An instant survey conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them believe Obama the winner, while 25% points to McCain.
An excellent performance by his listmate Joe Biden, expected in the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm Obama's advantage on Thursday.
"Subvaluing it would be a mistake.
He has a good idea," warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his undisputed experience in foreign policy, underlining the opponent's "ingenuity" with regard to the arguments addressed during the first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." has often declared multiple shots.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president," he said.
What has been a constant target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without prolonging, it has proved concise and precise.
He promoted his predisposition to the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain has never understood, unlike Obama," he picked up a democratic spot this weekend, blaming the Republican for not taking the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a heavy rain, for an election meeting.
He did not even say the words "medium class" or "workers." The financial crisis goes in favour of Obama, considered by the Americans to be the most suitable person to save the economy on the brink of the precipice.
"Next week could be a turning point," said the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic intuition to that shown by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of poor economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating the intention to reduce taxes by 95% of Americans despite the sounds of Wall Street, the Illinois Senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear power stations by 2030.
With caution, the two candidates evaded questions focused on the 700 billion dollar financial rescue plan (470 billion euros) adopted last night the Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Have you noticed that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents protested Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to contest in advance the results of the legislation.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of the polling stations in Minsk Central Square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While still waiting for the results, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some confess that they have not even voted: "To what extent will they do what they want, of my vote," says a boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has been good for foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the visa ban on 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
They weren't, according to the opposition.
"We were removed from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the ballot box," said Mr. Yuri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a fait a change," says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for the 2006 presidential opposition and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the cards and in this case it's the executive.
If Members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament may involve a television space, regional meetings and proposals for legislation."
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not provide for any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process recognises the validity of the election.
He stressed that participation quotas seemed too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) had given way to all kinds of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there were elections? Asks social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will have been no more than five Members of Parliament's opposition, the most convenient in power."
The night silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomed their success.
The meeting - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, since Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, it regained public confidence, seriously shaken by the scandal of blood infected between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a tragedy and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to spread recommendations to prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was slow to draw up a report, some provinces set up a committee to develop a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gelineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Québec started its activities, just 38% of people declared that they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continuous efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and to research on the field over the following years, we regained public confidence," he explains before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population of Quebec had already trusted in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, many cases of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, were seen in Europe, and she is at the chair since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we absolutely didn't know if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It was therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports that when you have doubts and could achieve a serious disease, in this case the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob that manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, take exclusion measures.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was refused.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that this disease is without a doubt transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has thus shown us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for the identification of HIV appeared on the market: the tests of nucleic acid (TAN) that allow to recognize directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not the presence of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, that is from the moment the person contracted the disease to the one where the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and of not being able to identify them is thus significantly diminished.
These improvements have led to a significant reduction in the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood samples will have to be distributed before someone gets infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years to find a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion.
I believe that today you can feel calm in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover your health, says the head of the Hema-Québec management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by an insect.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to having safe resources, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies.
"Needs increase as the population ages.
As cancer cures are more aggressive, patients often need red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the number of donors who on average constitute only 3% of the inhabitants of Quebec acceptable as donors."
All healthy persons who have reached the age of 18 and who meet the eligibility criteria may, however, donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be refused for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we manage to maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
Weak cases are very rare.
But we must renew the members of this group of donors as they age and can no longer make donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today life is so frantic that it is hardly an hour to donate blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, hema-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, eye-glob heart valves and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited with the Hema-Québec that manages the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, there is blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion in the bank of our thousandth blood cord sample and we plan to take more than a thousand of them every year.
We should start proposing them for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of collecting cordon blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot have access to it", as hema-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - The impact in semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinals of the A series, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during a second decisive quarter-final match at the Saputo Stadium.
The centrocampist Antonio Ribeiro has scored the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first time without a goal on both sides, David Texto and Rocco Placentino marked the subsequent networks for Montreal.
For Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
We remember that on Friday's first game of return, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, the Thunderler finished a first 3-1 in the return game winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinal.
The Impact will face both Friday and Sunday Whitecaps, but further details will be confirmed during the day.
In brief - Kovalev's Decisive Network
The Canadian and his axes are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, scored a goal, took two steps, and picked up a pass for victory, in the fourth of the Hab preparatory games.
Decisive for victory the only network signed Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet, he warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel at ease."
"He tried to overwhelm in the first period," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a good ovation."
Charest tip to the North
The Prime Minister shall not exclude the start of elections before the end of the year.
Following the conclusion of the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to be elected on the occasion of today's partial elections.
"Enlarge the boundaries of our last great northern border": this is Jean Charest's long-term ambition, presented yesterday in Levis, through instruments with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Image Mill".
On three screens, there was a mix of spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means like in the middle of the election campaign.
During the press conference, however, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the launch of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the most recent speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, merely explained why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but did not pronounce itself on timing or investment quotas, just as he did not explain what specific priorities would be in the implementation of future projects.
At the most, it has merely pointed out what it believes deserves a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which, following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure, has experienced several improvements.
According to the list drawn up by Charest, the North contains "nichel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "large territory doubles France" is here, it's Quebec.
Not only is he here, but he is embedded in us," he insisted, as he wanted to solicit a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: gold fever in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister at the press conference.
" It is a position traditionally maintained by all governments.
There is a boundary line on which no agreement has been in place for a long time, and when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government," he said.
"Considering climate change, the North needs to be re-evaluated," he said, speaking of the North-West passage, which will be open throughout the year due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty."
What about the locals, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Member of the PQ d'Ungava), have already given way to the consultation of about thirty communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) occupies an important position, started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would also abide by the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concluded, ordered and will respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the first Liberal ministers who preceded it.
"As the Liberals who preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves in order to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was on the other hand one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage as head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Centrale in Diga Adelard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, another reference, conservative this time, was made to John Diefenbaker's "Street to the North" programme, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Faced with the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest specified that its commissioning would be scheduled for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will do it," he confessed to his activists, raising applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of launching a poll in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He points out that he is certainly very busy, particularly in a federal council mission to China and in the Quebec-New York Summit.
The weekend General Council provided the Liberal leader with a platform for nationalist resolutions, in particular the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed smoothly like oil: the PLQ calls for the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Council and that they would have a right of veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the outline of the North Plan has been sceptically accepted.
PQ leader Pauline Marois re-dusted Quebec's Northern Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
In her view, the Liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had done so, "we would have made progress today" said the Marois at the side of Jean-Talon's candidate (scrutiny that happened today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ stated that it supported the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
"What we hope for is that all this is not simply perceived as a show," commented the leader Sébastien Proulx, replaced by Mario Dumont, in return today from the holidays.
Letter - A dishonored country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice of Harper's Cabinet, who allowed himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a shame for Canada.
In this way, dishonoring a woman who has fought relentlessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says much about both the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated a citizen detained in Guantanamo's concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time of the events against him.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child-soldier rot under inhuman conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, for information, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Order of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, invoke Omar Khadra's return so that he can undergo a regular process in Canada.
It is proper that same government that closes its eyes before torture: it matters very little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after many years of suffocation.
We still don't realize this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", a word that Harper does not stop ostentatizing and that sounds so foolish about his lips.
Here we are at the moment when there is no more morality: you can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until now minority (to see what will happen after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect for the Law and the Order represent salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame lies right here, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President Director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
In pursuit of an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the largest gold company in the world has filed a complaint for defamation by six million against three authors and a small publishing house squatted with the intention of initiating a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a complaint for defamation, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden from Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who dares to stand a position contrary to his.
Little does it matter the outcome of the process, the writers and editor of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a considerable amount of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with clearly learned weapons, against an army of lawyers financed by the pockets practically without the fund of the mining company.
On the other hand, in these struggles of learning weapons, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual settlement that would undermine the opposition as well as scare anyone who dares to speak again on the issue.
If the Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is before the public opinion that it should have presented its own vision of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually held with the exchange of views and not with manganese strikes.
It would therefore have been sufficient for society to open its books, documents and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and misrepresents petitions and letters in support of Black Canadian authors.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his contempt for that very public is very obvious?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word indicates exclusively the fragrantly paid lawyers and not all Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – is that the audience that supports the authors and publishers of Canada Black does so primarily because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the perspective of what many perceive as a sort of embalming (seeking the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Nero an ultimatum intimidating them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, the complaint from the Barack Gold constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies in block the right to quote authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss uncomfortable topics for the richest companies in the world, many complaints, who will be able to do so?
If the Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following scientific standards as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are a part, has been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it is not seeking a transparent debate at all.
This is at the expense of the university world, as is the case with the same public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit abusive demands.
Operation - rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the head of Congress, representatives of the Republican and democratic leadership, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the greatest saving-finance plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion US plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months, still needs to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
It provides in particular: checks on its actual implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses charged for non-payments, as well as a right of inspection on remuneration paid to managers of protected enterprises.
The American Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day talks marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the American economy and people from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted this way, invaluable discomfort and unrest would have turned on the daily lives of Americans," Republican Judd Gregg said.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The limited time allowed corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
Together with the negotiations later on, the two candidates for the US presidential elections were quite in favour of the agreement, but they did not want to express their dissatisfaction with the adoption of extreme solutions.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has the merit of adding some provisions to the agreement, in particular the one that will allow the owners to maintain their home and the one related to the remuneration for the managers of companies covered by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to find out if he will vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyse the details, but I hope so."
"Staying at what I read, it's something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward."
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to recover with taxpayers' money the doubtful credits, the risky and unsold assets of the American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that led first to the collapse of mortgages at risk (loans) , then extend to other more widespread forms of credit certificates (PCAA) and lead to the freezing of liquidity and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge to blow up the first draft of an agreement last week.
It seems to have come out of that blind alley since the Democrats accepted that the active "toxic" of some companies in difficulty is only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone in Congress, a provision was added that, if the government were to face losses over the next five years because of this program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which 100 billion can still be added if the President deems it necessary.
The disbursement of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will obtain shares in the protected companies that will pay dividends in case of profit and that will be able to sell when the waters have calmed down.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the borrowing procedures for real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and start-up allowances paid to the managers of the undertakings involved.
Starting today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that they will be given the freeway to their plan.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both at the Republican and democratic leadership.
"Evidently, Washington does not hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Chamber's Finance Committee, to his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But certainly not to take advantage of taxpayers..
Leader of a small group at Congress nicknamed "the caucus of skeptics", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation in a different way, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw conclusions quickly and to examine carefully the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, he once again saw himself as proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would give up the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of 2 billion euros (US$ 2.9 billion) for the crisis of real estate loans at risk in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is one of Europe's twenty largest banks and ten largest insurers.
"It's not lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In return, influence and voting rights are gained in banking matters.
It is certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that the times are uncertain."
During this period, at the other end of the Channel, the British government seems to be in the process of nationalising another bank in the balance sheet for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all of the loans currently under way at Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be you to buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty of blue eyes was for a long time his ace in the sleeve, for others his weak spot.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the embalming smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to true sacred monsters.
Oh, that's so tough.
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut ranch, following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the past few years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of which he was long a sort of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, as a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, last brand of quality.
Since in him he recognized himself all an engulfed country of safe made man, of the fighter of the Pacific war, proud in the struggle, which in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, he subsequently attended the Actor Studio of New York, before triumphing at theatre, on television and soon at the cinema.
The same civil rights activist was also the motorist who classified himself according to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
They leave with him the shadow zones of a star reserved, discreet, engaged, allergic to the scandals of the show-business, of which one will never fully reveal its mystery.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a dip in the heart for the kinephiles, while his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is reproposed through its interpretations.
The fascinating cow-boy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and the boy unable to desire the hot wife (Elizabeth Taylor) are confused in memory with the cat on the roof that was adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him in the shoes of sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that did not keep what he promised.
Many other Paul Newmans have come to history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Lassù someone loves me, Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That nice villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in the Lo Spaccone, magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), Martin Scorsese's money color, which earned him in 1987 the only oscar on 9 nominations.
That face through the years, it was his.
He's still here.
The eras happen through his path.
Young people know him especially for George Roy Hill's cult movie Slap Shot-Dry Colp (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop of the Coen brothers.
The circle had closed with one last role as godfather of the Irish Mafia in my father's era in 2003.
Unlike the most legends of the cinema that soon abandoned the trade, Newman will stay in the halls for a long time, denouncing Hollywood throughout its outburst, celebrations and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, defined him, with a point of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging him to overreact his performances.
The profession was not always a game for the handsome Paul Newman, whose roles seemed to fall like manna from heaven.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholic carrots or desperate, of which he expressed dismay and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, powerful sensibility.
Jennifer's first time in 1968 (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the role of the protagonist, drew a subtle portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott for an overdose, dedicated in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old comrade of arms Robert Redford (they had performed together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) affirmed with infinite sadness" His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a career of legend, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a Hollywood drifter, is thus shut down.
We will have seen her face stand out on vinegar bottles, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her as a choice of bad taste, although she was born as a gag.
However, the revenues of those sales were intended for its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sticking to his myth, chose to commit himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that said" Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege."
And it was also a privilege for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
A model citizen, then, and much more.
What has been produced in Zuschlag & member invoices factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and members will be discussed.
Politicians and their associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed within a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the money obtained from contests was used by them for private purposes, and they have often certified the carrying out of the activities through false invoices.
State and municipal money, in total 65 million florins, ended up in part in the caskets of the organization Fial Baloldal, in part in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they have taken the money obtained from invitations to tender on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To do so, the billing blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, instead the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue invoices, it was established, among other things, during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of the latter he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for the consummations, on the model of these were then prepared the invoices to be forwarded to the contests, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András, who, according to our information, has mainly drawn up the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "journey studies" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and members in 2003, the dining place provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, so many people, according to the restaurantman, would not all enter the club together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, hereinafter referred to as Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért, a full of formal errors and content.
A pension in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay for the night, but the invoice included 130 guests.
But the compilers of the invoices full of fantasy exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., also this one deals with catering, in whose accounting - according to the information given to the judicial authorities - did not even appear the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the company's administrator, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he immediately realized that they were false documents.
"On the stamp the name and the Iva game of our company were at a wrong point."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons, it was not even the fact that according to the invoice, 100 people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
In addition, the invoice was for catering and their restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The assiduous invoice compilers did not worry to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, organizes only trips abroad, so foolishly indicated on the invoice with payment in cash travel in Hungary, which did not agree with the company's practice of issuing invoices.
Moreover, as demonstrated during the investigation, VAT was also included in the invoice, while travel activity to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was wrong on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövőért foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company it is necessary to apply the VAT to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the invoices, also the employees of the hotel only issued printed invoices, while the invoice manufactured was handwritten.
In addition to this, the "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated as activity carried out the transport goods on the road, as is known from the Procura procedure, activities that were not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
In addition, for formal defects - due to non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it has been discovered that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sports Field of Kunfehertó, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The falsifiers did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) you lunched a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, which is why the curator of the liquidation of the company, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They have consciously issued invoices
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialisták in favor of the Együtt foundation in Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the accused, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
He also collaborated with Zuschlag and members of Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued worth about 5 million florins to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, Atlasz Eggiesület Association and Vörösfenyő Eggiesület Association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
No movement of money because the prepared invoices were then twisted, but the associations forgot to put this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong those that are connected to the defendants.
Ivan Kubatov, authorized at the address of the general manager of Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, who deals with fuel and motor vehicle trade.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer media, worth about 18 million florins.
According to the investigation data, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The director general of this company was a Romanian to whom between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would have submitted the documents concerning the company.
As far as we know, during the investigation Kubatov acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt companies in Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány and the countervalue was taken by him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian bulldozers founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies was actually operational, because according to the defendant they had not received work.
However, the companies have made it useful because, at the request of the co-defendant lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the company's founding documents, invoices have been issued on behalf of the companies to associations related to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued 15 invoices to the various entities for a total value of 14.2 million florins.
The prosecution considers that Kubatov has charged 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as Iva.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition ban.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországert in January 2006 submitted a notice for the public utility agency of the Socialist Party, Tancsics Mihály Alapitvany (TMA).
They have also won 500,000 florins per head but the sums have not been used for the purposes indicated in the ban.
In order to avoid this, they presented to TMA five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecutor's office, will probably report the trend in the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if defendant number one, János Zuschlag, would decide to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and even though he has promised to talk about everything in an extensive way several times, he has not yet done so.
We must see if it is in his interest, it could also be that the socialists have made agreements with Zussi, which - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to do the scapegoat.
Zuschlag could have been offended by the fact that his requests to lighten his prison conditions, i.e. the granting of house arrest, have so far not been exhausted.
While authors of non-reparable commercial crimes and causing much greater harm can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of excessive bidding: why spend more money?
At auctions buyers are inclined to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economists researchers at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study in Science magazine, men do not want to stay back in a race like eBay auction, so they are also available to pay a higher price.
The research sought to trace the nervous pattern of this "party" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the auction game, in which the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the body striated under the cerebral cortex enters intensely in function when you lose to the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price increase is explained by scanning the vehemently reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, the research group economists conducted a financial tracking survey.
In this investigation, three groups appealed against a partner under different conditions.
The control group reported how much the actual value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
To another group besides this they have promised that in the event of winning they will receive another prize of 15 dollars.
The third group would have received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost the money in case of auction losses.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them the win was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
Checking the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group playing "against loss" were willing to make higher bets of the control group or "win".
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These, in fact, so far explained the phenomena found at the auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to contact your doctor?
Almost half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
In Hungary the number of hepatitis patients amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7000 are cured: the reason is that many patients do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective name of contagious liver disease caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical of hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms according to the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the food channel (e.g., water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal losses, saliva).
For those travelling, vaccination against A and B virus is useful, and against C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellow spots are formed on the skin and white of the eyes, the faeces become clear and the urine dark, healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die every year worldwide for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancers.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subduly destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore it is very important to prevent and perform regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
In the world today, the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since a routine laboratory examination also reveals the disease, it is worth talking to your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated by the body, thus ceasing infectious power and preventing the formation of tumors.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 worldwide by associations of patients.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith functions as a sort of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of the quite bizarre investigation, an electroshock was made to 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists, while all observed a painting depicting the virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first in a series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University are also involved in addition to academics.
The test was carried out exactly this way: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the hermitage of Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the virgin Mary would give rise to a sort of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's picture was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and considered it to have a peaceful effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time circle received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while watching or painting on religious or other themes.
Catholics reported that the vision of the virgin Mary made them feel "secure", as if "someone took care of" them and "were reassured and pervaded by peace".
Looking at the religious picture, they accounted for 12% less pain than when Leonardo's work was before him.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with strong effect even for the atheists, but we must find the right image.
"We have to look for an image to which very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father, are nourished" said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the result of the search.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." - Wright added.
After the excellent results only the question remains if the painting of a Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of such calibre is presented to believers, what effect could it have on the control of pain?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On the tenth birthday, Google can claim to be both in people's pockets and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, what outpatients they attend and what interests them.
This, however, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of the company, is not enough yet.
What concerns skeptics who compare with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see the substance of the Web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as much personal data as its users and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google's founders that it was: "We enter into a system all the information in the world!".
According to Google's director interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
To the question what will happen in five years Schmidt answered: he would like if Google could answer questions like "what am I going to do tomorrow?" or "what would be the job for me?", but the software can't answer seemingly simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware that during their internet searches exactly the words sought are recorded, from which IP address are searched and on which page the interested people stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago users e.g. can store their browsing history, they can about what they have searched and clicked, then in long run they will generate far better tailor-made results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services according to our preferences declared and registered previously.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I'm dealing with? - concerned users are asking about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases the counter-reactions of the internees are caused by the fear experienced by the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, by the fear of punishment, by the desire for freedom or even by the rebellion to power.
One fact is confirmed, however, that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of internees.
The most striking example of this in recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against paedophiles in Brazil, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify paedophiles from the page of the community Orkut maintained by Google.
The internet users concerned about personal rights instead sighed of relief in May when the company - in agreement with the EFF electronic legal protection association - has successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: even later you can not force Google with any point of the constitution to provide any information requested secretly by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully removed almost 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search expressions obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but still failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back to two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data defend Google because they believe that this will affect their intimate sphere and private life by beginning to use its services and rise up with the rebellion of multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile the American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users appeared in many countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, the Microsoft liquidated as conqueror of the world because of Windows, as they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for their services, the source code always kept up-to-date and the program package is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software colossus.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies one of the most often repeated keywords in recent years, the web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 speaks only of collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: show ourselves.
A young medium can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists its musical tastes, all these can put them in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which appear automatically its most recent photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa.
Meanwhile, we read of many exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common tour of friends, comes to know easily with those who spent the night her perfidious boyfriend or a company can fire an employee because she has written a sincere opinion on the business summit: one thing is certain, the concept of private life now has completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make it possible to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis behind the behavior of young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something or just wants to avoid Google's monopoly can do so (e.g. by starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but who at the same time does not voluntarily leave traces).
There are not a few people who do not register on purpose on community pages to not be found, Google's online applications, from text processing to image management and news gathering, can be replaced with alternative versions not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile so far.
Public opinion doesn't even wait so long secretly for the moment when Google will pull out the claws.
Currently the company with its 156 billion dollars worth worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, the services introduced in record time, instead cause great distress not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software development companies.
However, the critical observers next to all this find alarming points: the company summit, for example, completely rejected the employee protest after doubling the company's asylum line, considered it too expensive the repeated catering to the employees' daily pleasure, but all this diminishes in the face of the fact that in 2006 Google has skewed the head to the Chinese government and according to their agreement the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines of Google will assume such proportions that the company will soon find itself in front of the American Supreme Court, others are afraid of the health system, in fact in this we can create our health profile with our references, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic basis can offer good material to the next generation of science writers, the story Scroogled by the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached alarmingly.
Two underage children helped Ózd's double homicide to make tracks disappear
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd, suspected with merit of having helped to make the traces of the crime disappear - said Tuesday the spokesman of the Police Question of the Borsod region.
Young people have acknowledged the crime against them, they are currently accused of favoring.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI information, defend themselves on a free foot.
Favoration is punishable up to 5 years in prison.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old man of the place, Sunday was detained in pre-trial detention.
He's suspected of premeditated multi-murder committed for profit.
From the investigation it was found that the young twenty-three had a large debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off the debt, for this reason last Wednesday he lured his creditor into a yard in Ózd where he and his 9-year-old daughter were killed.
According to MTI's information, the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a sign is that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of the use with the involvement of an expert.
Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer advanced by the Poles despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which intends to sell in a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 states that the offer of the Poles represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have presented an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all interested the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead in the future to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Finance Country with a share of almost 25%, followed by the Bank Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday comments on the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 11 September".
The global financial disaster occurred thanks to the American President - accuses La Repubblica - who was unable to compact his party behind a law drunk in all haste, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire super financier Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second September 11th.
A part of Madrid's press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has cast the world economy on the brink of the baratro.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing and will be suffering from it all over the world.
Bush's plan was not perfect but as a result of the Congress vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just when the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to let go of the threat - mentions the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a life-saving stamp to floating financial institutions and taxpayers' money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then neither the financial means nor new improvised solutions will be enough.
In the long term it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and to concentrate control on the dismembered financial markets.
Only Monday did the weakened financial institutions get more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which the anxiety seems increasingly real that even European taxpayers, like the Americans, will have to hand over their portfolio to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
The "savengers" must not unravel the EUR 100 billion immediately, however it would be better if they established in which case taxpayers' money should be touched to prevent greater damage.
The smart machine mimics the flight of the calabrone
What could be the best method for developing anti-collision technologies if not imitating the sensors of the obstacles in nature?
For example, bees.
In the amazing project presented to CETEC in Japan, the calabrons gave the initial strategic start to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built the BR23C biomimetic robot, a mini robotized car with bees properties, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can scan all collisions.
Flying bees form one's own oval personal space that really resembles our protective shield - it explained to the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of the field technologies PR and research and development.
Important is the role of the view of the bee, capable of a visual of 300 degrees in each direction.
Engineers have drawn to the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the bee view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor on board that turns it immediately into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, in a different way from the current system, takes place entirely instinctively.
"If it weren't for the robot car, he wouldn't be able to react quickly to avoid collisions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot auto project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the harmful and more internal layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in a heartbeat.
But unlike bees the deviation cannot go upwards or downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the steering direction of the wheels.
In this way instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lithium polymer batteries, lighter and with a high energy density, which means that their duration is longer than lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the promptness of the intelligent reaction, not data processing or even less the ability to store it, is important.
This robot needs to process some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so it uses only a few tens of Kb memory.
There's no need for a memory of gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, in anticipation of Nissan, can be installed on serial vehicles within 10 years.
Further possibility of application can be represented by unification with GPS satellite navigation system that avoids obstacles on the road leads to destination.

The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue law for the purchase of disproportionate credits has been drafted, to be applied in several parts.
Half the sum is spent in the first step.
In the new agreements protracted until midnight on Saturday according to the time of the eastern coast the congress leaders decided the rescue plan of $700 billion after a debate that lasted for days - reported the Reuters.
We have taken some serious steps forward - Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American House of Representatives said that it was only left to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
The treasure minister Henry Paulson spoke of the result of the compromise stated: the program will work and will be effective, but there is still much to do. According to Pelosi it is not about the rescue of Wall Street but about the reversal of the economic cart.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets at 8 a.m. Washington time (on Monday 2 a.m. in Central Europe time), but it did not bring a big increase in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the 2008 economic stabilization bill for the program, after which it will be passed on to the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, then welcomed with joy the news of the deal to the White House.
We are pleased with the progress achieved last night and we very much appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Fratto spokesman for the White House.
The program, however, differs from the original Bush administration proposal, which provided that the $700 billion would be spent on the purchase of securities with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now as a first step one can spend at most half of the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the Monday vote of Congress, with these the Ministry of the Treasury will acquire securities with disproportionate credits behind, the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will monitor the program to which the president of the Federal Reserve also takes part.
The spending of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Ministry of Treasury may apply a combined tactic: it may at the same time purchase mortgages, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" claims.
Purchasing can take place through auctions and directly - they have announced competent ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance programme where the Ministry of Treasury guarantees the means that give concern, for which companies will pay an appropriate price for the probable damage.
Henrz Paulson said: the law gives the necessary means for $700 billion to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to get us ready to introduce the newly signed law - he added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and awaiting state aid think instead that the government will limit their success, defined by the overseas slang simply as golden parachute.
The limitations of payments will only occur in some cases, and the limitations depend on how the Ministry of Treasury will offer the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry acquires in the framework of an auction, it will impose an overtax on the gold parachute, if they do not send the deceased bank manager to retirement.
At the time of direct purchase of disproportionate credits, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the money of directors is not exaggerated.
To this it should be added that the existing contracts of the gold parachute will not change, the limitation is valid only for the new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation on the remuneration of the general administrators - commented the provision the Democratic Barney Frank chairman of the committee responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition to this, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the program, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also earn us if the economy, and together with it the bank saved, will stand up.
The bill understands that in the next five years the president must present to Congress a proposal which has the means to return to taxpayers the expected losses arising from the financial sector.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what the American citizens asked us not to defend the taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican deputy of California Darrell Issa.
Her democratic colleague from Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around 12 January the American-Hungarian visa-free agreement will enter into force - the Foreign Minister has spoken about this in Chicago with Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion "now everything depends on the fact that the ultraocean is built in time the electronic input and control system".
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be an entry permit, but before departure tourists will have to be registered.
The Hungarian diplomatic officer will continue the negotiations in Washington today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will deliver the medal of the Order of the Hungarian Republic Cross with the Star and will hold talks with the foreign policy advisors of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the bank's rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two great American parties, guaranteed their support for the $700 billion government plan for bank rescue on Sunday, but there are politicians who claim the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
The representatives of Congress and Administration after the marathon talks lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they had concluded an agreement in principle on the rescue plan of the banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package of the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more suitable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with the leading economic issues Obama has again regained some advantage, considering McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment of Sarah Palin's vice president, he has dispersed.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed the hope that the Congress would quickly approve the 700 billion dollar bill.
He stressed that the proposal contained those consumer protection steps which had also been supported by him.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn't let himself run away from defining past McCain's economic ideas.
McCain in an interview at ABC explained that "all those who are going to send down this situation with difficulty (...) but not doing anything is not a way to go."
The Republican senator reported that the proposal included the creation of a monitoring committee of the finance minister and the limitation of the good outflows of top managers, things on which he insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no merit role in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably already vote on Monday's bill.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more self-conscious - thus analyzes Der Spiegel the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the left German magazine, in the article The Revolution of Bavaria devours its parents to analyze the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polytologist, CSU erosion has already begun long before the sad couple Beckstein-Huber took office.
The Christian-socials have modernized Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago had been achievable: it ended the indisputable hegemony of a party-state.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had dropped to 47.7%, for the first time under the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 again in the period of the so-called Stoiber.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization in the region, which devours parents.
The sociologists predicted it 40 years ago, but they missed much of the time. But secularization, the results of education, the settlement of the East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not have been without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased possibilities and the political consequences are evident.
The pole on the right is intact, only within the pole have voters become more conscious, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classical bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: the free professionals, the artisans, the diplomats and the graduates.
Here support for the CSU has fallen below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Venezuelan conservative newspaper "Who with whom?" In the article "The Presidents of the parties are stuck in the issues of coalition" deals with the confused Austrian internal political situation created following the elections.
SPÖ intends to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ's intervention in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections have been made, now it rotates all around the coalition; in the debate broadcast by the public TV the leaders of the parties have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann President of SPÖ confirmed that he wanted to deal with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann has left the question open if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current President of ÖVP, as Vice-Chancellor.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course has in any case been rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
If your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still an open thing in the party, the issues must in any case be discussed within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ has repeated to be open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition we are ready to assume the responsibility to govern," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organised by France this year with the rotating presidency of the European Union, began.
Livia Járóka, Fidesz Member of the European People's Party, in the message addressed to the plenum as the main rapporteur of the Congress, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and also the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimír Špidla, responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
The conference was attended by governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights organisations in the context of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the parliamentary group Fidesz PE, has pointed out, in addition to the discrimination in recruitments, that the Roma are being expelled from the labour market primarily because of their low schooling.
"Most Roma young people do not have an average degree of study and as a result of poor quality elementary education only a few of them are able to achieve a higher degree of study."
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in asserting human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to make these links more aware in the wider context between Roma and non-Roma.
In fact, the sooner a Roma school begins, the more they increase their chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid for income and consumption they contribute to the nation's budget.
"The right of European citizenship of Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools" – said Livia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, the European Union's unity of purpose and action is necessary in order to speed up the process of disintegration of schools, and for this reason it is of fundamental importance that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be complied with.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be stopped, Roma children must be given the opportunities given by the democratic space to contribute as citizens in full terms of the future of Europe" - Járóka asked.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised every year, since last year's Berlin meeting, is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at state and European level.
CSU: pity for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the immaculate Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Despite the bad electoral defeat the heads have not yet fallen, the Bavarian CSU summit has for the time being postponed the discussion of personal issues.
The president of the Erwin Huber party and the regional governor Günther Beckstein still remain in their place, the question is until pity lasts.
The fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the party's extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have made it clear in any case that they are not attacked with all the strength to the chair.
So they tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that one day after the Bavarian tsunami claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber then at the height of his career, the Christian-Social Union obtained 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber fell to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years has been "absolute monarch" in Bavaria that gives 18% of the German GDP.
However, conservatives in the southern region are always of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, and in future they will be forced in any way to co-align themselves.
As the first sign of the reorganization within the party the vice president and federal minister of agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir of Huber, gets a place in the narrow exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the FDP liberals and with the Free Electors exponent right values for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke about fate in the list of Free Electors enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as a coup opportunity by the couple Huber-Beckstein and then treat the woman with no regard for the great ambitions.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their forces to stabilize Beckstein somehow.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also play an active role, which he has so far been plotting in the shadows. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU defined 28 September as the bitterst day of his political career.
On Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful towards the CSU, according to which they would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, will be put back on its feet with common forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the loss of CSU land will not have a negative impact on the great Berlin coalition.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the injured CSU, the crisis of the social democrats, but it still lasts.
The SPD has achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Nor did a representative of the opposition enter the Belarusian Parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), instead it is explained by the misdemeanours committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in a country of 10 million inhabitants has been devoid of opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition collected under the name United Democratic Forces (UNDOs) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections held in disputed circumstances, would "give" some seat in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus given up a boycott previously evaluated.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which requested credit for reducing the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians the gas pipelines in possession of Beltransgaz that cross the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter because of the Belarusian political situation considered undemocratic.
It referred to a distension that the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, placed emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on one third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's early Monday report also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates in practice could not appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present on the count of votes.
Despite this, according to the opposition, an improvement in the political climate is noticeable: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also prepared to a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of the South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms on paper a federal state, considers the two countries independent already for a month.
We have taken two steps and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said Aleksandr Milinkevich to our newspaper.
According to the presidential candidate for the 2006 election opposition, it is desirable that it remains despite the fact that "power has been afraid to bring even one opponent into a weightless Parliament".
The opposition does not foresee protest actions for the results but rather tries to get the voters the message of the need for economic reforms.
Obviously we have many problems, we have to print the newspapers of opposition in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but also so I see that more and more people support the change, even among the elderly - Milinkevich said referring to the fact that not even the officially most aided ceto, that of pensioners, considers the Lukashenko regime that considers its main result to be the creation of social security.
Because of the country's debt and the increase in the economic deficit it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security "which recalls the sepulchral silence" - Milinkevich believes.
In contrast to the opposition's policy, the Russian observers judged the elections to be democratic.
Sergej Lebedev President of the Community Independent States said to the Russian press agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors for the entrance and exit of the employees.
But from now on, this new measure is taking off against the smarts, against the stamp and then going to drink a coffee at the bar in working hours.
The new antifannuloni was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services" says the minister.
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens.
This is reformism," Brunetta continues.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance on the part of the employees, says the Secretary General: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all".
I mean, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and cornet.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a beautiful cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister then makes known that "in three months the absences of public employees' disease have reduced by 50%, that is to say 60 thousand more people to work in a year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - the minister explains - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above the rates of inflation".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees joined forces to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the minister of the public function will today have numbers about the less absenteeism at work due to disease - writes the consumer association - the people of the 'working phannulloni' is constantly growing.
Thousands in Italy are the employees of the correct and productive public administration who have joined forces to declare war on the illegitimate rules contained in the decree."
In particular, the Tar will be challenged by the exclusion of additional economic treatments for illness dependent on service; the extension of the time-limits for the availability of sick workers, within which check visits are carried out; and other aspects contained in the new provisions intended by the Minister.
Incident work, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur on the job, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, the Inail data confirm that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, Anmil celebrates the 58th National Day in all the provinces of Italy for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalised on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalid of work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "sustaining appreciation for the constant community commitment to workplace prevention, the protection of unlucky workers, the care of families of victims and the raising of public awareness".
"It has, of course, raised an outraged 'basta', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, because of their size, arouse the cry of the media and the involvement of public opinion but the daily reality proposes to us dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is given to the many initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness by young people facing the world of work.
It is necessary to pay close attention to the phenomenon, not to depreciate in the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve legislation.
For his part, the president of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment to bring you urgently to an end".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not take away that the number of white deaths is still impressive," noted the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"In fact, we do not want this "low-down trend" to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when the attention goes away that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level there is still too little to combat the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion - Mercandelli has emphasized - more controls and inspections are necessary, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, starting from the world of school".
"It serves a further effort - he added - with regard to communication and public awareness.
But above all, it needs a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation provided for the victims of work" and "the welfare income to which the system is moving in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give back to the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who are unfortunate should not depend on spontaneous or exaggeration from time to time arranged by the legislator".
Mp3 readers charged, risk hearing
Listening to high volume music for a prolonged period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a press release in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than one hour a day holding the apparatus at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings - the responsible EU continues - there is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What matters most, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and take the step with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - concludes the EU executive - confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine with Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related equipment."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard which limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but raises concerns about hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damage by using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of noise exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable musical equipment if they listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the limits currently in force for the maximum noise allowed at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would cover 5-10% of the users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the sums will be drawn.
This is the timetable set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which settled this morning in its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once the beatings are closed in March, the Junta and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official bubble" of the Campidoglio and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are all the political, social and cultural ideas - it is important to emphasise Alemano - it will have to provide proposals for an idea of development in Rome of which the political decision-makers, which remain the Junta and the Municipal Council, will then be able to make use.
There is no overlap of roles but only the desire to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time term.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemano replied: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be there, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be crucial.
Too often politics crushes on the management of everyday life and on the emergencies that are being eroded from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future".
Moreover, the mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is neither an unnecessary body nor a carriage: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences expressed by the Capital".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, neither closed nor immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which it absolutely needs, thinking with unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, the mayor of Rome says, "will not be limited to the present communal boundaries alone but will look far beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but "also in view of the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who wants us to be independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing just as the election date approaches.
She wrote a Miami lady on a web site: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big face: he believes that he will win the highest office of a nation that he has had in all two governors and five black senators!".
In fact, they are attacks that do not say much; they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? There are Polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
Even in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the guts of the South of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the booth to vote we know well who will give his vote to the American patriot.
One side of the American mindset is kept covered up to the last.
"Tell us what you want, then we'll figure out where to put the cross, whether on Obama or McCain."
Some people swear: If Obama wins, we'll leave America.
Things never said before, that almost certainly appears the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were Bush's mistakes during his tenure? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home to kick in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to pack.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak spot.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge job to do.
Use, the economic strain is also felt on journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the internet, "killer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Well, journalists today are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, newsmen have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
Also the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we do not want traditional journalism as the big audience means to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that the national newspaper is on the wrong track.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The major publishing houses open up to the Internet, for many views like the "killer" of printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn of has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap today in American journalism is among those who run the newsrooms - i.e. the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure that their reporters divide their values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this has to do with "work security".
Executives who think they lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% at the national level.
For the staff reporters it goes to 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a vast nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and internet employers often offer what they want and thus becomes a question of "take it or leave it", take it or leave it.
Directors receive almost always large wages, while the editor can earn even 10 thousand dollars a month, as well as pension and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: all days after the first year, all after the third to reach 15 days overall after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, often get sick during the year.
It's all about the weather.
UNIPOL: ROMA TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOLA RESTAURATED TO GROTTAFERRATE
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the case of real estateist Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a dwelling in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the Unipol-Bnl counterpath investigation.
During his trial last week, he obtained discharge from the housekeepers transformed into an obligation to reside in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate owner could travel from the provincial town to a house in the capital.
According to the court, however, these movements (to which the defendant has given a contrary opinion) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion saving plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
It confirms yesterday's New York Times by informing us that the ongoing crisis is breaking the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old, moderate East Coast soul, in favour of federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "D Washington people" and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, for the point, which became prepotentially alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
This just mentioned, however, is only an example of the changes, of the great changes, which the current economic earthquake may preannounce or already let it see: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not even here alone.
Both in the US and in Europe the crisis seems to function as an accelerator of long-term incubation phenomena that solidify and finally come to light in the new climate.
The first of these phenomena is the realization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category State-subsidiarity in relation to a sort of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, yes, have strong links with abroad, but which first and foremost see the budgets of individuals and families living in one country, in one State, to a great extent.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of play or not to have much to say: the flash test is given by the European Union which divides as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies cannot decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of every single State that everyone expects interventions, rescue and re-launch plans, new rules, and above all the provision of funds: since when you get to the narrow it is only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in sixth place.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which no market and no international organization will likely ever be able to dispose to a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized from a point of view that our future will have to do more and more with those very immaterial things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look at a bit, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are still absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So that those who are sovereign, certainly have several more cards than those who are not, to those who have the misfortune to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty, however, which predicts a fracture.
Those who say Territory, State, Government, inevitably say Politics, and thus Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for self-reliant leadership, the demand of someone who can take control of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species, revealed so inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And together something even deeper and in a sense disturbing: a disbelief, an indifference, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
In other words, there seems to be an increasing trend, in large sectors of the population, towards the belief that before their actions are the same ideas as the social elites so far, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall meaning of the term, to have made their own time and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneanly feeds a ramified but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political attitudes, which manifests itself in the sudden "revolts" of elections or in the sudden unfolding of collective moods of these very last and recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the Labourist consents in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
You have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it more and more difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not taking shape today in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is invigorating, increasing, potentially agitating.
In the face of all this, speaking of a "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not for nothing.
The supercolumn to walk on the walls
Beat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutions has gone very close to us.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimetres the scholars managed to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
LO STUDIO – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of those existing that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the geeks, covered by microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "gets off the wall easily" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Engineering Faculty of Dayton University.
CAMMINAR SUI MURI? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Perhaps so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may concern aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – Also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article on the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars presented a microfiber adhesive as hair that self-cleans from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Pharmaceuticals: never with fruit juices
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are dissitant and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time as some life-saving medicines, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with also serious health consequences.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with the taking of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple to reduce the absorption of some life-saving medicines, cancels the beneficial effects and endangers the health of patients.
The grapefruit juice was already under prosecution because it was considered responsible for increasing to levels considered toxic the effects some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicines.
PHARMACI A RISK - The same Italian Medicines Agency had reported in a newsletter two years ago alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger resulting from this mixture and to be careful what they drink in case they take medicines such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELMO - According to experts also orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan:"These discoveries are usually immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually arrange to change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the package leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear to us, don't make us impress but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification» the expert at Ansa agency stressed.
The Nobel Prize in Economics in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade patterns and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Yorker who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publisher of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, on the days when Enron failed, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that triggered not a few polemics and that for years it was made to the economist, but that now it has proved to be exact.
"I am surprised and also a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economist of great value", but also a divulgator with a style"very aggressive, particularly critical against the excesses of freedom of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here's the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package.
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work by volunteer developers, whose shoulders watch SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with various new features: the welcome screen and the revised and less Spartan interface, adding more substantial ones such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also placed to interoperability with the 2007 Office Suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them via email, or the possibility to import PDF files into the graphic processing module, keeping the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or text processor.
The collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene with multiple hands between different users, avoiding the conflicts on changes, in the text maker, to each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The Italian version is available at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request can also be shipped home or at work the installation cd.
And if the theme of gratuity can be a tow for dissemination in homes, it is precisely in business that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects realized in public administration and in schools.
And there are also the realities that offer an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding videowriting of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the emulo presentations of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows working on the databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third ranked and winner of the best climber shirt.
To report the news is the website of the daily L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner at Cera, the third-generation Epo, after the Italians Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also the Gerolsteiner.
The tests on Kohl's blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will face the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of his positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the best climber's peas shirt.
IMMIGRATI:NEW YORK TIMES AND QUESTIONS, IS ITALY RAZZIST?
Italy "from the country of migrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
Is this transforming Belpaese into a nation of racists? Is it what the New York Times asked in a long article that dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the Nyt defines as the "north paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support for the North League".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also mentioned the intolerance episodes of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
The new legislation required by the League to tighten the brakes on immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegals is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The trend highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Student victims of caro-rents up to 900 euros for one room
The rent market for university students knows no crisis.
According to the latest investigation by the Sunia, the tenant union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very serious characters to the point of excluding entire groups of young people from the right to study for the very high total costs that families of origin should bear - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand by students has so distorted the market to trigger a process of generalized increase also for residents".
In most cases rent offers then contain a number of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, without fee limits, sub-rents linked.
For Sunia there is a need for extraordinary measures which, through the revision of the tax system, can calm prices.
Looking at the details of the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a place bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Black Band area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence, one bed is on average 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are requested for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecity).
It saves only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples for a bed it takes 300/450 euros, for a room it spends from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, 250/350 euros are needed for a single bed, at least 350 euros for a single bed.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but have a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rents to extra-Community students is more frequent, as in Perugia, there is finally a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the fee requested to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Good-bye old cinema Paradise, cities cancel historic halls
Historical cinematographic rooms close in favor of the Multiplexs.
"A city without cinematographic rooms is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the great Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of the large multisalas and the consequent death by conjunction of the monosalas in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that seem unstoppable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and loads of memory, "it is as if there were less a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of road and many emotions", observes the director of New cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won to Tornatore the Oscar Prize and the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, and which recounted the poetry of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way of living the lost cinema perhaps forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of the exercents, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and to pay for the biggest school are mainly the halls in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures, Emilia-Romagna has 82 single-sala cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to prove that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multisala cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to move into multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund for practitioners: the State's previous debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
In order to support the sector, it would be between 16 and 18 million euros a year".
Interestingly the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about the closures, has decided to run to the shelter with the signing of a protocol between Town and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote monosala cinemas both in the historical center and in the periphery.
Among the rules provided for are tax facilitation measures for managers and mobility benefits for the public: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will have special rates for the stopover and in some parking lots.
"It's an initiative I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is true, however, that in order to counteract the overpowering of multiplexes traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New cinema Paradise", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, there where I have lived so many shared emotions, so as not to see the signs bored by the dust turn me on the other side".
Links between politics and 'Andrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the choices of the Commune to the interests of the Piromalli cosca".
There are heavy charges against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in Mafia association.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his granddaughter lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already condemned by association for delinquency of mafioso mold, condemned to compensate 10 million euros.
"In contempt of any legal and moral norm, as well as common sense," the prosecutors wrote, "the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay advice to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been thus granted to the cosca - the judges write - to enter officially within the municipalities by facilitating the already enormous possibilities of control and direction of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organized malavita are many" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'Andrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean'.
This morning's arrests followed last July's arrests with which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalli Cossack.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always for alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved by the task of administering the Municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Mayor of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, was elected head of a centre-right coalition, after the May 2006 ballotting.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called in question the then Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Marco Minniti, accusing him of having architected everything on a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the Cosca Piromalli had even asked for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, they write the pm, it emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a wider group notoriously close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cosca".
When the energy is born from the waves now the bigs come down in the field
It is a dead end, which occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the world's great energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have put their eyes, and now try to put their hands, colossal like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil dropped around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmentalists and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 per cent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by sea-moving facilities.
This amount would be twice as much as currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides.
Put yourself under attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was the Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in Northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy they are increasingly and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying technologies on ocean energy - he has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the US oil colossal to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us".
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to initiate a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It is a signal not recently, especially if one considers that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron there are the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the road of energy that comes from the sea and the sums invested so far, as far as not known in the details, indicate an interest in ascendancy according to the observers.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still on the rise, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to cause great problems to the ecosystem.
In order to produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now there are four such installations under design, waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could be used for a military installation.
The Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are tides turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, deserves the potential of tides right now.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun or the waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on the energy of tides that states like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others who face the coasts, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and previewed investments up to 35 million for 2009.
