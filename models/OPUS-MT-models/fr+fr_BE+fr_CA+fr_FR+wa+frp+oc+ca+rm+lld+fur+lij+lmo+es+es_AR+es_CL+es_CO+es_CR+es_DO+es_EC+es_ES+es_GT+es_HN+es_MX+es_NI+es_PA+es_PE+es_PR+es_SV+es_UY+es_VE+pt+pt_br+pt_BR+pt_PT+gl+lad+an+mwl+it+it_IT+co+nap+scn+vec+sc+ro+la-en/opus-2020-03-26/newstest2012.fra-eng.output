Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament refused, as part of an amendment to the criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph concerning the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
On second reading, the MPs rejected the proposed amendment to reduce the penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for entering into a priori disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgement is not final and the court must decide on the appeal of the convicted woman in December.
Tymosenko called the regime's decision of political revenge and provoked a process of suspicion of bias of the court to the west as well.
The proposed annulment of paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve.
Libyan victory
Libyan liberation or rebellion already has its defeats.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners are still to be determined.
As usual in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but they are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the customary right of Sharia and we already know what this is about.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a flight we cut off our hands.
Women can forget emancipation, women who do not respect their faith are liable to capital punishment...
It is the Qur'an that will unite in place of the personality of the dictator the society composed of opposite tribes.
In Libya, such an order will prevail, as we cannot represent it and as we would certainly not like it.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and would probably not benefit Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted aid with recognition from unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who was leading NATO strikes, but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated at every attack.
When it comes to seeking the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam and our peolitics turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
So there's no problem for the premises to get rid of the "crosses".
Without land occupation, oil companies will have easily accessed Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of the protection of human rights stakeholders.
So far as we're concerned, we're preventing these Sharia adherents.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the viewer of investors.
A tornade of statistics has passed on Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the states has published GDP-related information for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats every record.
Investors not only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Chechnya and other European countries published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP has a projected growth of 0.5%, that of France of 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better placed than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (this was discussed at the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that we are moving towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than forecast by analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, according to the forecasted and recalculated data on a regular basis.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, corresponding to what analysts had planned.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Performance on 10-year bonds is 28.45%
The yields of the obligations of Spain and Italy are rising to critical limits.
Problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
The yields of Czech bonds remain below 4% while the situation worsens in the region.
There are voices in Germany that the ECB should be the last instance guarantee .
The Czechs qualified for EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The football performance has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the super Cech and the guard Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also defended with good luck in the second part its qualification and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second.
The Czech performance also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
Montenegrains were under pressure until the second part because of a precise Czech defence.
The vicitmas of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances of scoring a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech performance will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
The two teams were hard to build combinations and the game was concentrated mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national footballers did not come to grips with the Czech defence, which responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from Ispahan universities created a human shield on Tuesday around the Ispahan Nuclear Technology Centre where uranium is transformed.
They have thus openly stated that they would defend their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
Israel is reported to have a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
In the case of an attack, the objective of which would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: do not take breakfast and take charcuterie for dinner
More than one third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren are overweight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This again shows how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models around him is.
For example, in the tables of obese children, there is 50% more charcuterie than in normal weight children's families.
19% of the obese had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness action "Obesity is not a chance"
In the families of the big children sport is also not a habit, which is now the case with most of the students today - only 15% said that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place in the last school year and involved 900 pupils from primary schools in Chechnya.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a chance", action supported by General Health Insurance and Unilever Society.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight and even obese children is the absence of a proper diet and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch - snack-dining, which is a basic principle of a good diet," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and charcuterie at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that having a healthy development requires some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In Chechnya, only 23% of students' families eat at the same time.
In most families each takes breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that's been raised is that a tenth of the population doesn't take breakfast at all.
Breakfast is, however, the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in obese children's families, unhealthy fries are more often consumed.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks sweet drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned do sports regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Get your food ready.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food based on the possibilities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Among their favorite dishes there are many cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is in particular a high preference for sweet lemonades", is indicated in the results of the survey.
For lunch it is the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
Children did not want any starches at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Health focus
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a review of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session "Obesity is not a chance", a determined will was observed to move towards a healthy diet," the survey results indicate.
For example, the most notable was sweet lemonade since children began to give preference to drinking water.
The children most often checked the questionnaire for white meat and fish as a main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and knedliky (Czech speciality of breadmeal balls or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry at the fact that there was a lot from the beginning.
I wasn't thinking about what was going to happen next.
The presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the dress of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we approach the final exams and the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it's really "buddy."
This time we have with Director Alenka (in the course there are no boys) dealt with how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this kind are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without a particular curve, another of the overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften broad arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus come to emphasize the character nicely and also not to dress too visually of the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine size.
If, for example, there is a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that skirts or pants do not pass at all, this is worth making it fit.
And you will not regret it because the clothes that fall impeccably are priceless.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slides constantly, rolls and does not stick to the belt and so on.
For those with a male appearance can afford a Tucker style dress, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort out all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that with regard to what I have to do at home there's too much.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must consider the current appearance, the type of personality fashion and its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, which you may know from the Victoria Secret campaign.
At the bottom of me, it makes me happy, because it is better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost 100 kilos lately (do not take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search on the internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodleboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Thinking also about the graphic part of styling is also important.
The stylist does not dress only physics but creates, for example, productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, has maintained all of this.
But this... till Sunday
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests of the specialty gave a diversified look to the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single garment in a different way.
Variability is for this prime example.
Like for example this trench-coat that must be worn classically with a jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can dress also the naked body, with scarves and take it as a picture as a dress.
Or just lift the sleeves or collar and have a new look immediately.
"Play with it" he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then start to break it," Jakub said.
Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have far more variations of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say, for fashion story that will have about ten pages (so about ten models) I must be ready to "retail" at least fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to rely on this when creating a model.
The fact that image and style sometimes make half the success has been confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
Just watch Madonna who is not a great singer but her image and marketing made her a world star.
In Chechnya, the approach to the use of stylists' services remains frillous.
And the familiar faces sometimes consider them useless (just that I know something but what I seem to pass in second place).
And if someone gets a styling from us, then we have to count on the fact that he dictates to us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than the one he actually has.
Then we only have to navigate on google and make sure that the bill of boulevard reports the celebrity in question, whether it has lean or big etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to focus in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He needs to communicate with the people he's wearing, and so it's important to be a good psychologist.
To know how to guess people, not flatter themselves, to keep his opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out his wardrobe and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything away and tell him, my God, what a horror."
"You'll find some things you'll find nice and he'll advise you with what to wear them with," says Mario.
This one showed us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
It's the one you hang around the waist and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to things clearly defined as scissors, hair styling rollers or baby pins, there is also nylon wire (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which one closes a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple are not usable because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we are not just people who listen but who have tried something in a practical way they have taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could crumble, at fortiori outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We didn't have the right to touch the scissors so we wouldn't get hurt inadvertently.
Thus, there is a real need for skills.
Mario pleased me when he congratulated me on my creation.
The count I'm talking about isn't for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of classes
I'm beginning to understand more and more that doing styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone say what they want.
The need for speed The Run is fighting all over America.
Revision
Originally a problem-free race is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift at work.
This fills everyone's ambition to some extent, but it's useless if no one wants to do anything else.
The new subtitled The Run produced great expectations before it was released.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed racing series and to come out a kind of game from the playable games that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how the added passages will be in which the main hero comes out of his car and does what he wants.
As already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was achieved.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole shoots down because of some useless mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible phainetosis on the part of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught in the adventure whose main hero Jack has character problems and to solve them starts to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to get the first one to New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the stages planned in different environments that are quite distinct from each other and interesting.
The player does not have the feeling for a single moment that the game proposes something identical to him.
Some environments are quite nice overcroit even though the graphic technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
Well, that's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are in addition to time with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Next to this the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There are only a few, but that's enough.
A few moments ago you try to exceed the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) and then you run against the watch (classic duel with the timer) and then another duel awaits you with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and who try to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is the out-of-vehicle crossings.
It's more of an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away to someone and you have to help him by typing on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer times of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is as good as this because this element is not likely to interfere and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that accommodate the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means there's nothing extraordinary right now, but we can't say it's negative.
As far as realistic simulation is concerned, you will have to go to another place.
But although we can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
At the difference of the driving model, the collision model is not yet at the point.
We do not expect from this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not have, in a collision with any object, any idea of how your car behaves, it is therefore not completely good.
During tight exceedances you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car leaves in crazy voltigos.
Or it's in crumbs.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done so that when you broke the figure or you went out into the decor the game brings you back to the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you must start the game again from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, in case something doesn't happen the right way, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes the restarts do not help and you have to find the solution by remembering from memory the piece of itinerary in question.
The big thing about this game is that the same actions are in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that need to be passed in a certain way or that does not happen.
Otherwise you meet in a given place "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute late.
What gets angry are the situations when you see easily passing the opponent between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you either have to put yourself aside and bypass them or brake them.
It's equal if you go ahead of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always comes close to your nose.
The opponents still have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you to the same place.
This gets the most angry at the end of the game when you roll on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must at all costs pass in front of you.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you come into collision a lot of times.
We can understand that the goal of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during the races.
You need to pay attention to gasoline pumps on the routes because you can change cars there however most of the time you have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylinders for straight motorways and super sports cars with exotic twists on very technical pipes, for example on lancet roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places you know about adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
This one connects online with the Autolog function which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult blows to understand is the situation of the last race of adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speed indicator shows you between 150 and 200 km/hour (previously) and behind you comes a subway train that sends you the car directly to the ferry.
At the writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought when creating this game or whether the authors really think of us as fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is disturbing is that in more extreme situations imaging does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This mainly concerns accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging is no longer used for anything.
The sound part is good and the track is the choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the youngest public a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General Impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confusing.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it's the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it's not over.
The fun is really good but prepare yourself for the faults to hit you in the eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.
The Velvet Students in concert with the choirs of Charles University
The Festa Academica festival offers for the third time festivities that link the International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.
During the festival there are 20 choirs from higher schools and secondary schools.
The clove of the festival consists of two concerts organized on 17 November.
"Charles University has an important part in this festival."
"Among the choirs there is the Choir of the Faculty of Pedagogy and Humanities, in the committee of the festival sits the Rector Vaclav Hampl", says the leader of the organizing team Jakub Calou.
The clove of the festival is the concert of the Choeur des lécoles et classes secondaryes which takes place with free entry on 17 November from 2 pm on the space located in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the program there is the composition of the well-known Czech jazzman Karel Ruzicka, Jazz Mass Celebration.
In the evening the concert "Students of velvet" takes place in the premises of the National House in Vinohrady where the choirs of the higher schools and that of Charles University take place.
The Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate with dignity the International Student Day and recall the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present to the public a choir music of the highest level and to develop creative cooperation of young people.
The main organiser is the Czech Cherry Union in cooperation with Jan Kepler High School.
All the action is under the aegis of Bohuslav Svoboda, Mayor of Prague and Vaclav Hampl, Rector of Charles University.

The program also offers high-level concerts, msical meetings, student happenings and other activities.
Participants will find all information on the internet pages of the festival www.festaaacademica.cz.
Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect such a hard war."
"It will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," said Milena Vicenova, Czech Ambassador to the European Union, who began her presentation at the Faculty of Law.
When she was able to describe the different bodies of the EU and their relations in such an understandable and visible way that a large number of speakers at Charles University's Faculty of Law could envy her, she showed how much she took her motto "understandable and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning the criticisms echoed that he is tired, that it is a round-of-leather, that he cannot replenish any mission and I have to say that he has cut everyone's breath because he holds his role to perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to be taken from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in the context of an answer to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "What telephone number should I call?", therefore as an important step towards the unity and greater legibility of the Union's policy vis-à-vis the states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our syrecky (cooked pasta cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has experienced, lives and will live in a short time.
She called the Czech presidency a success two years ago.
The Czechs resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to the words of the Ambassador, "the activity has beaten its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved now.
It is also necessary to approve the new septimal budget of the Union, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it would appear that the budget will be thin and for savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped most, at least, everything is to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
Madam Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an comprehensible Europe".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted horns, bananas that are different large or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky."
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have the reputation of being eurosceptics and people who only see things in their negative aspect more than positively.
Furthermore, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
According to her, the fault results from several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, this Frenchman tells me: 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group still doing?" and he is not at all happy."
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future it is new hard rules on budgetary policy that await the Member States.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not a multi-speed Europe, that prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the strengthened cooperation institute".
First of all, it was said that the countries that want to cooperate with each other and those that do not want to cooperate remain in their own corner."
"There will be many such institutes and there will be a truly two-speed Europe," says Vicenova.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all themes having an impact on the EU must be discussed among all EU members and not just the Eurozone members.
History of a brand:
The innovator IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to look for the word that expresses the IBM strategy as closely as possible, the closest would be "long term".
For a large public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The foundation of this long-term strategy was laid by the company's first head, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved in the near future so that people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE'!" became the imprint around which the life of a giant future will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to edit in 1935).
It was the foundation of the culture of the company carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it always remained faithful to its core values and yet was not afraid to change all the others around it.
This has enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more"a delay for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid vacations, an insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and commmercials.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed client relationship system.
The company was at the beginning great in the discovery of talents- as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been working at IBM for 30 years and is currently in the position of Chief of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has been doing what is called jamy, brainstorming online from which many future strategies and innovations have emerged.
It is no wonder that there are many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that assures it a secure position in the field of business.
"Since the beginning IBM had a rather institutional concept than a technology firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a company that helps solve business problems by using its technology," said Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Grande Bleue", as it is called familiarly in the United States in view of its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the world's largest firms.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, accommodation, consultancy services at the level of server products up to nanotechnology.
She holds numerous patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of her employees received a Nobel Prize.
Among its discoveries is, for example, the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM found itself this year with 220 billion dollars the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it surpassed in 1996 Microsoft.
Preview in advance
Not all innovations and manufactures have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example has not succeeded in betting on a OS/2 own operating system, the Prodige service online or the PCjr IBM computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the advance movement you cannot emotionally hang on to the past," notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it leaves.
Unlike for example the Microsoft competitor who at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
Prospective Technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However still in 1990 she was with more than the strongest participation motivator of hardware.
From the year 2000 IBM sold low-performing assets for $15 billion, during this period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of outlook technologies.
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it has overcome the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased his investment volume.
Did IBM now appear to be passing through the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM action has grown from 2008 in a 120 percent rocket, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
IBM's logo is to change everything but not its values.
For this reason, we can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
History of IBM: From cheese slices to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 1980s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 presided over the company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
The leader then shadowed the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that until now the identity and culture of society are based.
Watson ran the kuss firm until 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - cheese and meat slicers up to the cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, revenue grew to $9 million and the company's expansion began in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of management it was his son who occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM's people and computers helped NASA guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determines the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take care of advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas that have not yet been exploited, such as transport and city management.
As far as IBM is concerned, a "Smarter Commerce" platform recently developed that helps traders manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history on our territory.
She created her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno's strategic outsourcing centre.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the global research and development team responsible for the recognition of the word.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep that donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova summer asylum in her home, she did not doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta insisted on moving from Ricany after 30 days, Pepa did not repel the singer.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
In time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate, there will be no wife to welcome her on the step of the door of the house.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost ass, but a man with whom I have a particular relationship," let Rychtarova filter by showing that she has detached from her husband but that they only remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to him is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change."
"My wife set up a wedding on paper and I respect it."
"Society continues, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we discuss it completely normal but we don't sleep together," Rychtar said for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he will not prevent it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she's going, who she's having an affair with.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take on all responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Women's worst vices: Does that concern you as well?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all of them, like each other, are able to get them out of their sleeves.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of female vices that can pump the blood of men's veins.
Procurement
Does your half make you remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one garment a week?
Are you happy to buy and package at the time of the sale?
In your case, we can talk about buying like a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you'll say, who would resist the lashe-vitrine of clothing stores, to look for yourself nice clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Just remember how many times you've told your spouse he's waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"I would need to lose at least 5 kilos - should I start doing sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't these phrases remind you of anything?
Yes?
You are therefore one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop caring for yourself but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about its appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more frequent these complaints increase and the more women become poisonous.
The smell and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite ride.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the floors, dust, dig the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they dirtyed the sink, crushed the living room window, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer precisely from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can, however, ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The Work of Toads
"Put that worn overcoat in the trash."
"Are you going to put those old socks on again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do this toad work on your partner this way several times a day, you will really decompose it.
It's obvious that you don't think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much toad work...
Defamation, persiflage
Defamation, persuasion, but also insults against someone are also the property of some women.
Women are particularly interested in relationships and thus are happy to deal with topics such as, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each one of us lets a little harmless perspiration escape here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a special feature of women.
But the worst are those who counsel, persuasive, even despise others and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially at work in a group of women.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in Philadelphia's victory
Hockey striker Jagr twice took part in Philadelphia's victory during the Monday NHL game on Caroline's ice and is again leading Czech productive players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was named the best player in the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr also scored two goals during the game.
Jagr after the match told the overseas journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game he'd give his hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," Jagr explained after his Giroux action marked a goal of the first Flyers shot.
A moment later there was a second assault of the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the goals of the Hurricanes for the pallet and presented it to the Butter Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Practically in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds turned a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the top three," Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him."
"I'm really happy about that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at the NHL the other players on the team tried to play on me, now it's my turn," added Jagr.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again of Dwyer on a penalty shot it ends with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read has not ruled out any other complications that end up two to one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He tapped on the pallet, I took speed and (Read) went to the furthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the last goal of the game from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia came with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he went out in the second third because of an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not stand in front of an experienced defender their two-purpose advance lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
That's the fact that the backline was sick that mostly annoyed the local coach rather than lost fists because they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"It sucks."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young people."
"But there's nothing to do, that's how it is," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement was not enough and we couldn't resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area."
For this we had limits, " added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, a Czech defender, took part in Winnipeg's thirtieth attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, which stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered trips mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have an inclination for the west and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, however, it was necessary to queue all night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it wasn't won yet.
The foreign exchange agreement that was the condition to travel to the west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many cottages and cottages that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
Since 1989 the voyages of the Czechs have undergone a great revolution.
Although until 1989 holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were maximum, the Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million holiday days in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia of the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in the neighbouring countries of the west caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment.
For example, in Paris travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a trip from Czech was at that time to take away his own canned food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was the interchangeability of the Czech krona, which allowed our tourists finally after decades of being able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and the average wage have increased what has caused around 1997 another important moment.
With increasing demand for travel, travel agencies have started to prepare tours with air charter connections since 1997 which, thanks to contracts, have dramatically reduced costs compared to what was before.
At the end of the 90s of the last century, Czechs had visa-free links with virtually most developed countries around the world apart from the US that later facilitated our journeys.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared for an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully join the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time again in history spent more than 15,000 kroner per person on vacation abroad including the associated expenses.
The General Assembly must find its President, but it may end with a situation without a solution "a pat"
Nearly 5 months already Czech football is without President and it is likely that Ivan Hasek's successor to the Czech Republic Football Association will not yet be known after another General Assembly which is scheduled to take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement that voting rules should be adopted.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the post-Hasek era did football return to differences between the Association's chambers that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely shown on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiation remained blocked and there was not even a question of dealing with how to elect.
There was no agreement as to who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or also the officials with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the help of the Office for the State and the Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
There are still differences in the rules for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations has not brought anything to the situation either.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the bed.
"The dissenting apple lies in the following fact: either to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Czech Republic's Football Association Dusan Svoboda who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the proposed model, in the third round the candidate who received the most votes in percentage in the chamber for which he is a candidate wins.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw so that the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes from both chambers wins.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes.
"It would only then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian side and according to which it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the existing statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even though he believes that the settlement of the elections established according to the statutes benefits the most Pelta among all the candidates.
"I would like to see a maximum vote in accordance with the statutes of the association."
"So that there are not yet any sarcastic ideas imagined by a representative like in the past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations defined himself mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The qualification possible today in the European Championship should calm everyone down."
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation" adds the Jablonec officer who among the three has the greatest experience in the direction of football both professional and regional.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between Czechs and Moraves, but there are trends in wanting to change drawing regulations."
"This can again cause a blockage at the General Assembly."
"I still hope that sound reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all the parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can tell if the entire football direction will be complete for the game.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorice, among others Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the executive committee on the ground of reprisals.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth and Sports Education Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the torn parts within the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If Plzen Tomas Paclik's head of footballers had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he was asking for for a new President of the Czech Football Association (AFRT), he would not be campaigning for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I don't run for election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Paclik said to the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl just to try to prevent Pelta from gaining access to the AFRT's head which would a priori be favored for this election.
Paclik also points out that in the event that he wins the election, he would hold this position as President only until 2013 as scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see in the function an experienced and high-level manager but who is not related to the world of football.
"I've been talking to people who would have the profile," he says.
"For me this was terrible when some told me that they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change this picture," he added.
What is said is particularly disturbing, Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates ' the General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable for Pelta to hold this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying merchant, it would be even less favorable to football," said Paclik.
What still shockes him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in the course of listening to an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta came out without any penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said a while ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the Plzen club".
In case Paclik triumphed at the vote on Thursday, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that had ended with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I'd go with."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of representation."
"But as manager of the Association he wouldn't be able to."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September attracted great attention when he spoke for the annulment of the Board of Referees with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims that he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private companies and who he has also been leading since last year the Plzen club, which celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it."
"I would curb the influence of some interested groups that, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," said Paclik, who does not dispel his antipathy for Spartan leader Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power with high-level policies would provide more gambling tax money for sport.
"This is one of the key points that the new President should take care of."
"If it is the tax on gambling as stated by the political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current liaison with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the President of AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla from Prague.
"It's not ideal."
I don't see any reason to pass on my actions from the Plzen club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later," Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should put an end to pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates for the Miroslav Pelta Presidency promised that if elected, AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end in the future to disputes over the settlement for the elections.
The Jablonec official is before the meeting on Thursday in Nymburk very optimistic and thinks that the success today of the football performance should calm this guerre before the vote.
Pelta before the September election that did not take place promised to devote itself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly and this two-month delay might well enable him to defend his vision of football management and to present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a President on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the Association," he adds, but he is primarily related to the Jablonec club, worked a lot of years at Sparta and the EU Executive Committee.
This is also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, statutes were approved that were not perfect as all have seen."
"If there weren't all these different interpretations we would have had a President since September," said Pelta.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has taken the attention of the delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as my personal mission and am ready to take all responsibility for it in case it doesn't work."
"It's a principle without which we can't exist," Pelta added.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes with regard to his legal training and that he is well aware that his opponent candidate would be his first Vice-President.
Nor has he long attacked Tonas Paclik who, on the contrary, keeps criticizing Pelta.
"He's been in football for a year and he's already had a few hits."
"His attacks were, however, not of the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said at the address of his opponent, but remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the competitions of the lowest level to the national representation.
It's supposed to be a football vitrine.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that start with that of the Bohemians or the continuation of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all the football," told Czech press agency CTK the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring about any change in people.
"I should meet with all the employees," he told Strahov where there has been an understandable nervousness since there was no management.
Although there are catastrophic scenes planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for anything.
"If there is only one point of disagreement about how to vote in the third round we will get over it."
"Football needs credibility and it will only be achieved when there is a new leader in his head," as Pelta says optimistically two days before the day probably decisive for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under its direction the AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Czech Republic Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday it would not please many people, it seems.
Rajchl promises, however, that in the event that he is elected, hard work will begin.
It wants systemic changes and makes members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various fields of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to take care of football in its entirety."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a successful youth football."
"But I'm not saying I'm gonna do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a given domain."
"And I will distribute difficult missions for football to take a big step forward."
"Many people won't be happy because it's about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He said that he would not be represented as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth it and if I have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and cast doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
"Many people still told me that I don't have to give up because they would give up too."
"It's a trust I can't betray," he says.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work begun with Hasek.
"Since the last two years there has been a great de facto job and I don't want to let it go."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone to stop them.", he said with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and that's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"Behind him are people who would do football in such a way that it would only be for those who were chosen."
"I can be blamed for a number of things, but surely I can't bear any."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy with it not only those who have been chosen
And he once again confirms that he would be only a President for Chechnya.
"And if anyone says otherwise, I'm ready to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division should be divided into two parts: one Czech and the other Moravian, the winners of which would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation like today with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I constantly feel support from the Czech Chamber, which elected me as Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes," said Rajchl, who is considering, among his future successes, saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, contract negotiations with televisions and on the gambling law.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault for all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can doubt Plzen that he did a great job this year."
"If he was elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make a significant change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his success," Rajchl said who assessed his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
Ovni-Objective Pataugeoires, beautiful pools in Budapest: Who travels across Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let his legs rest tired in gas-water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there's an item that shouldn't be missing in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Stretched on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged cupolas, and swam against the Putten marbles that waited for her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If a indoor pool pleased her, she would note in her notebook without delay all the details worthy of interest about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the architecture historian Meder and she presented them in her book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain". The municipal covered swimming pools of Münich, the historical bath palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She conducted her "most exceptional bath trips in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Alongside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia, respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true fervent bath culture.
Meder, explains that she doesn't have much interest in sport but he feels attracted to water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that swimmers should simply contemplate blue tiles and accommodate themselves with the stench of Javel's water while joggers breathe from the scent of spruce forests or can listen to the park's jolly bird gassing.
"I once wondered why swimming pools must in fact always be so ugly," said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A dive in a pool and volatile sauna oils - well-being factor in swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have given themselves a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on the one hand transparent, but it reflects on the other hand the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, springstones.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes a report worth 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to jump into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
Alongside the splendid well-being baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found nitrate-containing waters in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of spas whose basins are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászbereny) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the outdoor heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While with a roof of the Zürich bath you have the whole city in your eyes, you can admire the snowed Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski trail.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like an UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the mountains of Ötztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of the water of Javel does not emanate from all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a sulfur smell, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanate a strong oil smell, which it is hard to believe, to be in a health spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon glues you to the skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded terrain.
The bath designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
Looking through the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the growth of weeds between the tiles.
It has seen an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad's spa palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it is possible to discover not only neo-Roman elements that come out from its design in 1844 but also a mature hall in the Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of the pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it is native to Schwarzwald.
"It's already a great performance to merge such different construction styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor question.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to look for the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the group then wanted to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa investigation into the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study builds on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of the Stock Exchanges on global raw materials, pushes prices up and that banks share a complicity with world hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is in concrete alignment with Deutsche-Bank leader Josef Ackermann, even if the big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act the same way.
Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the view that the betters have detached themselves from the offers and demand - and profit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to the criticism of the American competitors differently: He promised to investigate the accusations and said, "No matter what it takes to put the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at stake."
According to information from the SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining Foodwatch-Report charges.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the raw material market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
Foodwatch leader Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The speculation on rising food prices shows in a particularly dramatic way, how much today's banks harm the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter to Mr. Ackermann whether it's about hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the group's CEO wishes to present a perfect picture, a few months before leaving his duties.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is planned on the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculations.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would terminate investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which on November 7 and 8, the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people.
Just eleven percent found this legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank's clients would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into the speculations on raw materials.
43% would not advise such a bank to their surroundings, 49% said they would think about the termination of their account to change the banking establishment.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell to ruin.
Now it is again open and takes place of exhibition house.
If you are excited about a modern post-war architecture, its clear shapes, glass hangars, bright and bold looks and new construction materials that are typical of belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the universal Brussels exhibition in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion once received the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its steel and glass construction, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the following Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the station of the south of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used for so long, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly devastated.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvédère Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a coup de chance in every regard.
The new start was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvédère.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career, among other things, in her youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she carried out particularly the transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments, she obtained public funds and private sponsorship and established its exploitation.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a café and a bookstore are located there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had carefully transformed and expanded Joseph Olbracht's secession and won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had "practically seen every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of its movement to Vienna and its change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the "building was "an energy gull," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, glass insulating reinforced fiberglass was laid and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridge beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a panel of light cut between the house and the road ensures the lighting, a bridge led to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but always the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The exterior doors of origin have remained, the house is painted in a shade protection against red-brown rust.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the authorities competent for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and cheap had to be found, and that also please the office of protection monuments," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a crude ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless wants "to awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands precisely the "quarter of the central station" all newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another shot may happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as he says, it already negotiates with the city to get a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a massive winter crisis in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more this year.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung reported beforehand by invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should improve the availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snowing of railway installations and docks should, among other things, double and increase to 16,000.
The objective is to clear the snow and ice docks up to the beginning of the service phase and 90 per cent of the track equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago the station chief Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems with the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been awaiting approval from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has for years had to do something, since it has to have the axles of the ICE trains checked much more often at the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ICE in the central station of Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the USA.
After Chief Josef Ackermann's case there is news in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the Deutsche Bank's problems were not enough already, the past of this giant in the sector is catching up with him in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison to 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator brings to the big banks a series of accusations of encouraging cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost enormous value during the financial crisis and led the banks down.
"We are satisfied that we have been able to find a solution to this, without the parties initiating proceedings in court," said a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank has not recognised any faults in comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which has committed itself to a payment of $20.5 million.
The president of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy in order to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair several billion dollar damages.
The comparisons made now are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other large banks apart and in summer he assigned to the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents, it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the American real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events are already a few years old, at present it blows on American banks a stormy wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous appeals for redress or for sanctioning breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 major international banks, the two US state-owned real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for having advanced in kind in mortgage transactions of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with the FHFA, which is a total of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but not to mention a precise sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and stated that it wished to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases by 10 billion in IBM
Buffett, the guru of finance, invests colossal sums in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until then, the big American investor Warren Buffett constantly explains not investing in IT IT IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only shows bad predictions.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
He had already had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight's attack on the world of finance.
Therefore, the TI IBM activity is granted the right to now be called "Mr IBM".
Because Buffett today revealed to the CNBC economic program, which he has purchased since March IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM never knew anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated management, which even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable benefits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has for some time been putting on IT profit services as an operation of the accounting centres.
The IT pioneer, over 100 years of age, offers both software and consulting as well as highly efficient business calculators.
Buffett had so far rather avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in businesses he understands business.
But on the contrary Buffett is rather attacking the railway fret, manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
Her Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares with a wide range of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
This 81-year-old octogenarian had taken over the Berkshire Hathaway small textile company in the 1960s and made it one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money earned him the nickname "Oracle d'Omaha".
Following the announcement of Buffett's investment, IBM shares increased by one percent on the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, has a total stock market value of more than $220 billion and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn't want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would now be reborn.
The assassinations of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population reacted with fear and concern.
For for many Germano-Turkish people the spectre that has long been believed to have reappeared: since the incendiary attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable with this extremist right-wing context against the Turks.
However, if there is xenophobia in Germany, it has never been mentioned.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has been detected reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology," "Tel was the title of the online publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out, on the other hand, that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right bourber.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted in a rational way: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony on the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of a slap: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Thus the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of the univocal conditions.
"It begins to stink", This is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
He pointed out that people would have been murdered, paid taxes and, through their work, would have made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
Police action was seen in a very critical way on the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why it has not already come much earlier in the minds of the German authorities to do research in some suspect extreme right circles, wonder the authors.
More than one is prepared for rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be flouted, there will be nothing left to migrants but self-defense and armament."
"it'll be the best self-defense."
"Inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the whole network," writes Selen.
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained well.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has made it clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, what mistrust and distance by acts of violence could lead to.
However, the attacks have exacerbated the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past it was above all the failure of German politics after the attacks of which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Head of State of Turkey, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time counted in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report by the Turkish media shows once again how deeply the distrust of many Germano-Turks has been towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to efforts to clarify and re-evaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
Zürich Lake scandal bank
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and skated in the meantime from one crisis to another.
It's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, in July he was known to occupy an almost as spectacular position in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the great Swiss bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed, welcomed and welcomed Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recently achieved solidity and made some kind remarks about future colleagues.
"The UBS has passed the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as early as September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had diverted all of the Bank's security systems and had flamed about €1.7 billion.
The head of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
the president of the board of directors of the UBS has since been considered as suffering - and all ask: When does Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the administrative presidency already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly need a period of adjustment.
At one point he then assumed responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which had just proved once again that it had long deserved the title of "the biggest scandal bank in Europe".
Indeed, the UBS is on one enormous side - until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other, it has been skating for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, saves the so proud Swiss bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also clever, had combined it with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an easy customer than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor for many years in Zurich says: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank in front of my students."
"In the current perspective, one wonders: how could I just be wrong at this point?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something did not turn round at the UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli withdrew surprisingly, which until then was regarded as a top intellectual and a great banker.
A few months later, we sensed why he left.
The division of the bank had flaming with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this she has indeed found investors, but who, shortly before, would have broken the eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was passed under silence, to the point that one has never even learned his name.
That was just the first shot, though.
In April 2008 this got worse.
The bank was to announce again losses amounting to billions, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second best paid board of directors in Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was, in view of its investment errors, in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank has bought the UBS tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland has been shaken - as it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to house such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of the UBS 2007 rose to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster he followed the second.
A few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated due to a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish easy customer data, which had fraudulently taxed perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million - in return for unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS has more or less published that it has helped tax fraud.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
He followed the withdrawal of the Head of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the ejection of the client's money.
Thus the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors in a few months: bank investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to aid for tax fraud.
And, as there was a little bit of a return to calm, and as we thought, that the UBS would get out of it, he followed this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single title merchant flaming 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was not round.
And it is published: with risk management in investment bank it still does not seem to work.
"With the case of Adoboli, we have seen that risk management has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
Thus, the financial director of a large German bank is certain: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not have control of the risks in hand."
However, it was precisely the idea of prudence, with which Swiss bankers had long taken office, that of becoming the guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unshakable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS power station in Zurich is still going to match the strong cliché of the Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its seat at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the central station to Zurich Lake, which itself is surrounded by snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, the store rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery like Tiffany's, we find them here among the shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the confectionery Sprüngli.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank to the Swiss Credit Palace to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, front are thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other strayed from the market - or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, the UBS and the Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business also with the two big banks.
The UBS would have become far too large, he finds - especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons would have also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxon morals."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the great Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country to the seven million inhabitants undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks jointly concluded a huge group.
A bank has been created, which was already too big for little Switzerland - and has constantly recorded an increase.
What helped was that the two different UBS Predecessive Banks completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as a strong point asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more strongly internationalized.
All of a sudden, international investment banks have had favourable access to a lot of money, with which they have been able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who understands himself very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who paved his way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted until the end in Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were reality," Geiger said.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance came before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly remembers the leaders' meetings at which the leader of the Wuffli group always uttered the same slogan: dethroning Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" the rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to go upstairs.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In the case of foreign exchange and securities transactions, she played a very important role.
However, the company advisors, who were responsible for this, pointed out a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference from the largest banks.
The UBS would have deficiencies in US mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Growing up, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in American sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has become a massive machine that has packed and passed valuable documents based on U.S. mortgages - but has also retained risks.
Even when other banks had long sought to go down.
"Even in the summer of 2007, while the U.S. real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," said Geiger, the bank expert.
The greater the euphoria the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts proved more difficult than one thought.
Posts at UBS have become ejectable and are up to now benches.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: putting an end to the investment bank, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment bank must run over vigorously, as far as it is clear so far.
Next Thursday, bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he insisted: he must lead the affairs of the UBS on a lasting basis, he communicated Tuesday to the Bank of Zurich.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress in the mid-1990s.
He cancels 3,500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He said publicly until now only that he was going to look with his wife for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of the recession in Europe weighs on the American stock exchange
The threat of a recession in Europe this weekend has discouraged US investors.

The general relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro has fallen from the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I had just half filled last week, not half emptied - but now the problems are pressing once again in the foreground, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
Especially the financial values were on the sales sheets.
The default values of Dow-Jones-Index noted a loss of approximately 0.6% to 12.078 points at the end of the markets.

American investors have sceptically expressed themselves: "We are not an island, on the other hand dependent," Goldman said.
Europe will soon not be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has only confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to put an end to the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was too early in its view to invest in bonds from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a multi-decade principle into the wind and entered the American technology industry.
Its investment of more than $10 billion to IBM supported the course of the actions of this traditional group, and enabled it to note almost more than 1%, against the trend of commercial management.

Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, straws are considered a "bird problem" but experts say that these very intelligent animals are no longer allowed to hunt cities for a long time.
Some like them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Cornellas have been in the city for centuries, but in many communities residents' complaints are increasing because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote to "the problem of birds " is not yet in sight.
During the first ostfriesisch symposium on corneas, experts said that it is no longer possible to chase the freux out of cities.
Experts from all over Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in cities.
The protection of nature was based on the problems of cities as well on the exodus of particularly protected cliffs: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, setting up and slaughtering typical brood trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are protected by nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 brooding pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest of which Jever, Diepholz and Achim are located near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative publicity because of the slaughter of the crows in that region.
Critics found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal gourdins.
"The normal expulsion, the evincement, is useless," observed the planner of the city and the landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests with pressure water or the killing of trees often results in undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr at Bade-Württemberg.
"The animals move away, the large colonies divide and they spread to other places."
Eviction can only be imagined in exceptional cases, such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem is not solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of animal release to an aversive conditioning and catchy offers, in order to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens was looking for "information panels instead of chainsaws" to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better support a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-roading-educational baskets at Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing on the life of these very intelligent brakes.
This project has been adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "There are a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Flies not only use working instruments to get to a regal but they themselves manufacture their tools as working instruments.
Ethologists at Cambridge University had recently tested four straws, how much bird intelligence is coming.
In an experiment, birds quickly learned that they had to make a scaffolding with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they definitely recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to cause the platform to collapse.
In a second test, the cunning corneals were then to solve a more frantic problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
Birds couldn't reach their spoils with their beaks.
However, the researchers had put pieces of iron wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four friezes are even successful from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks were unsuccessful.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the playoffs at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and then eliminated Ukraine.
Driven by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal has sidetracked against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after 0:0 of the game, its fifth participation in the European championship.
The Czechs reached the playoff game by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
There was also nothing more burning in the zero 0:0 match between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) break against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) marked the other shots for Portugal.
The former player of the Bundesliga Wolfsburg, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with a hand-played 11 metre-penality (41st) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) made twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted with a red yellow card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a 30-metre coup in advance into the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his distance shooting qualities and fired at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to attacker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English Manchester City Championship, initiated a headball directed at the bottom of the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek has set a goal for Czech
Finally, Ergolding's arbiter Wolfgang Stark at the center of all the attentions.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card in Portuguese (36th).
On the other hand, Stark awarded a penalty of 11 meters played by the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic probably diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-Champion of Europe made four hits and everything became clear.
For Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go for a fifth time to the EM.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1 FC Nuremberg), also had luck and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored at the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the rescue of the Czech world-class guard who had already been shot, once again, the FC Seoul attacker had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end has finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football miracle during that time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the 2002 EM third-party bench, the Croats were able to rejoice in their fourth round at the end of the European championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored at the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball for the purpose.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund at 62nd minute, the legionnaires of Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish have been celebrating their first participation in the MS since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken care of with a success of 4:0 the first step for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed at the top speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy got the first good chance.
Only at the last moment that Estonia's defence was able to prevent a possible goal of the -first-butter.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense of goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and locked the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
Europe's largest software company, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Until 2015, approximately two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, said the Dax Group on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees accordingly," said CEO Bill McDermott to his clients on an equitable basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the global business software leader will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the 176,000 global SAP clients are located in this expanding country.
China's growth plans are also an important part of the Dax Group's 2015 Strategy.
SAP plans to increase turnover by 2015 to €20 billion.
Last year, the Walldorfer registered an income of almost €12.5 billion.
Currently, software provider business management, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked so well.
SAP has been active in Chinese for more than 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities... " said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
Personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (Beauty and grief: an intimate story of World War I), it begins with a long list of characters that close your heart.
A tip to start with: carefully tear this page and make it your mark-page.
You will learn to know these people in detail. In this novel by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mists of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who issues the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book that he accurately described as "a book of anti-history."
It has some known names, important treaties or famous battles; almost no ambassadors or discussions on strategies and materials are found.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it could look like." There we find the "sentiments, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and grief" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, through doctors, ambulances and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Other prisoners of war, some of whom will lose members, become crazy or lose their lives.
Their lives vacillate here like the candles of a church: while some are extinguished, new ones are being lighted up.
Peter Englund's book deviates from traditional history books.
He denies the idea that World War I is only summed up by the terrible trench war on the western front.
"Beauty and sorrow" cleverly describes other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; a Christmas pass in Egypt under pyramids; the tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people such as a natural disaster, such as a hurricane Katrina who stinks the cordite.
When gunfire sounds far away, and you're a mother at home, do you stay or run away?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been exacerbated by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor from the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most approach deprivation and the ability to get away with it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz. "
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on alternative food in Germany.
It describes "meat made of cooked rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a false wooden bone); tobacco made with dried roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
He claims that "837 authorised substitute meats are registered in sausage production. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories address honour and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive towards savagery and says about war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey by hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarous behind your weighed and nailed shirt.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at great risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When we are resigned to sacrifice, we hope to have an audience," he writes.
Unfortunately, it is rather comparable to "a man convicted strangled in secret".
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He grasps the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the early-century bestiary: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothing, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as there are heroism.
Peter Englund talks about the soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the pus trade due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread over the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into a blindness for life."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his human task.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasps the way war has " unleashed exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion. "
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making war on them.
The best books dealing with World War I are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "To the West nothing new", by Erich Maria Note, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming thing I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he came out of his book, grabbed from your hands this page where the list of people appears and burned with a match.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti Park would be empty.
The operation remained secret from all but a few high-ranking officers and others informed from the outset that they were going to conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the police department.
There could not be repeats of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, who went against the Department's regulations and created a storm of public solidarity for protesters.
The operation to clean Zuccotti Park of its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police were preparing to observe the occupation in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures that involve moving a large number of police officers quickly - to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighbourhood.
The last training session took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move to the park came "at the last minute, " said a regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise. "
"The few policemen I know who were called didn't know they would go to Zuccotti Park," said the person under anonymity.
"The only ones to know that they would go there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city has learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, police wanted to clean up the park but were pushed away by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the neighborhood - dozens of officers who were used to particularly criminal quarters.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going and coming to the park during the day, like migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The recorded lights and messages of loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park with their light blue windscreens, many protesters simply gathered their affairs and left.
No tents were hit before 1:45 a.m. said the police, which allowed the occupants time to gather their affairs.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the Chief of the Police Department, stated that this measure had been taken only by security.
But according to many journalists, the police reportedly prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, harshly held by the officers.
Mr. Browne stated that the television camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police were moving west through the heavy business searches of protesters, including luggage, plastic lawn and sheets of clothing, teams from the sanitation department were following, cleaning everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged away. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
About ten people at the epicenter of the camp hung up together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut off the chains.
No arrests took place in the park before 3:30, Mr. Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended approximately an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of them are "trouble to public order and rebellion. "
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most senior officer to have been on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not lead operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
We saw the police expand the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of whom were equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the brightest actions of the night took place south of the park.
At about 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestant jumped on the hood of a police car. Others were spotted biting the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood came up flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protestant were hospitalized.
The school aid union continues the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school aids who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
Prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to attempt to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees, who were among the least well paid in the city, lost their jobs on 7 October. Trade union leaders compared these redundancies to political revenge for not letting the city access to a health care fund led by the workers' groups, which would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this charge.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott stated that the redundancies were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council replied, stating that the dismissals of school aids were not specified in the budget at all.
Council officers from the 37th District stated that they would complete a notice of complaint, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecutions to the Manhattan Supreme Court of State.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's education department will be the defendant. The complainants will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all of whom are black or Latin American, like most of the school aids who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city's legal department, said that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of redundancies in the city's most disadvantaged neighbourhood schools to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most support due to regular underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and just a few in the institutions of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants have lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the Southern Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight female school workers at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68% of school children live in poverty, the prosecutions state that "It is not a neighbourhood of wealthy parents who can bring funds to fill the budget gap."
Public school budget 36 has been reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of additional funding for each underprivileged student enrolment.
The union also asserts that the principals of high schools were misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators.
The memo used the term "overrun" to describe the action, even though "overrun" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "six-six parents' coordinators were dismissed", and "not only because of overrun."
Mission completed: Congress reached agreement on Libya
It would appear that the Republicans and Democrats finally agreed to the Chapter on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It will have taken a successful uprising, capture and death of long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachussetts), with Senators John McCain (Republicain - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honor the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"This is bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not the military role of the United States in NATO's mission to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day as the bill failed, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of US operations in Libya.
The American mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - the Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his foot.
Congressional indecision has been overcome by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
NATO's mission officially ended on October 31st.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution "congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination towards freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission or will it divide the legislators as it did last June?
The Senator and Chairman of the Committee Richard D. Lugar (Independent) objected to the last version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new draft.
Within the Chapter, the House must vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Congressional Republicans, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but this is not without trying.
The Goodlatte amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been tabled in Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others are slight variations from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would "control federal spending. "
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - especially the new Republicans who want to gold their CV - the chance to boast of being the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act (Budget Control Act) passed last August called for the vote of the House and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wished to limit the number of mandates during which Congress members could serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wished to lift the limit of two terms for the presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between same-sex individuals is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the annulment of federal laws if two thirds of states are opposed to them.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 at the 110th Congress.
The pace slows compared to the early 1990s when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, based on the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacre but not beaten" says Gabrielle Giffords during her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot him in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on a television show Monday night, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to get back first and foremost rather than go back to Congress.
During his appearance in the television newspaper "20/20" on the ABC channel, next to Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The show approached his difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called his recovery "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied "rather well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a one-hour special edition of "20/20", released the day before the release of the new couple's book entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special show has traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, he was seen on his hospital bed, shaved head and a large scar on the forehead.
She can only use one or two fingers, with her husband's encouragement.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sat in a wheelchair while doctors taught her how to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") asking to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos released by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: the Representative is being seen singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours every day with the doctors, said he did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading an article about the 12 March shooting when she stopped him and asked for information about the six people killed in the incident for the first time.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
"There have been many deaths," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
Hard, hard, hard.
When she recovered, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"So I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been slaughtered.
And you're gonna get out of it, restore yourself and come back even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for troops
The event: a Wall Street gala to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in costume-clavate stood at his feet to cheer him up.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A military high-grader present at the gala, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of the United States Army Staff, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were presented as some sort of orphan," wrote the military high-grader in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain prize, say some military.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock us in the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unrecognized or in disagreement with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the returning troops of the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most of the conversations about mercy take place in complete confidentiality among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the battle with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran hides under the surface " said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who made him go through the interviews were asking in a subtle way whether he would be able to cope under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after he returned from the fight.
"When you approach the subject of service, you are confronted with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The military's difficulties arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely congratulated by a country so unfamiliar with the army and which sees little direct benefits from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for World War II," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of a soldier's suffering.
The troops are recognized for the number of service periods, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The Army Faced with the Growing Pressure to Seize Against Rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for an alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She returned to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a beer pack.
He asked if he could join her in his room for a drink.
"It was an alarm signal," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane has put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she says.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her from behind, thrown down and raped, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and others not, will anxiously await the decision of justice during a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial against former defense secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not stopping the generalization of rape within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number amounted to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says she's going after the galonized military, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The leaders."
Counsel also states that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future legal proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of bringing together all the complainants in this case - thus putting all its eggs in the same basket - it will try several trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defense, led by American lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers on duty or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active staff.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants" indicate the documents.
The Department of Defense refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to battle, this distinction is recorded only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely male only.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldiers' teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially to get in touch with local women.
As a result, 150 female soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three more trials are ongoing in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Centre is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the Vietnam Veterans of America non-profit foundation is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorders " attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network (the network of action of military women), a group for human rights.
His group tried the Veteran Administration in December, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims of benefits for those who reported having been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, offering various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were registered according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defence.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20 per cent of military cases were prosecuted - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was sitting before a judge at a trial where she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six persons testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator, who ended up being acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was rendered," said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commander, "It wasn't his trial but mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult with a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed under less than honourable terms, preventing her from receiving any advantage.
Whether or not the Lyman case and the other complainants will move forward is a long story, says John Turley, professor of law at the Faculty of Law at the University of Washington.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is found between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army lies decades ago because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence as the responsibility.
"The odds are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things change only when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the complainants' lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue until there is a reform," she says.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted that he had been caught in a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, to chat with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right groups on social networking sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy... sign in to Facebook.
"We realized it wasn't that hard to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a report recently published by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook boasts so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they have been looking for with scientific precision - the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of far right groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to answer a survey. The questions asked concerned their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"This is a new way of doing research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
DEMOS's study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new tool in the hands of scientists.
Reflection groups, medical researchers and polytologists use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "Like", publications on walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three contents per day, the "supernova data" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research works whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate the people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to enter," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunken exploits were much more likely to be alcoholic than discreet students in this regard.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status would speak too often of alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Children's Health, Behaviour and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not otherwise be recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The team of the data site studied statistics on Valentine's Day and Valentine's Day, the 2010 mid-term election participation rate, and a national happiness index (through information only available - the digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site looks at them, whether they like them or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is anything else online.
"I don't think a lot of users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notepad and a pen remain the best tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social is not in front of a computer."
"Froid and inhumane": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and Norwegian Templars," he explains in front of a hearing room filled with 500 people.
"With regard to the jurisdiction of the court, I reject it, because you hold your mandate as organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because "he did not want to leave him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought a paper speech with him, to speak to the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in detention for an additional 12 weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya on Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally made some progress after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes when entering and leaving the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of 22 July seem to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, perhaps comforting some of them.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I would have preferred him to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a victim's parent.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find most revealing in a recently found Steve Jobs interview that will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film in the main markets, is how this creative spirit had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organigram enhancer - a man who believed many business leaders were suffering from a "disease letting them think that a great idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Trioph of the Nerds". This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aimed at popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in transportation.
It was only after Steve Jobs died that a full video was found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly reassembled, is the base of the 68-minute film called Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast at the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems surprisingly excited here to expose technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs resurrects, where he seems eager to hear Cringely's questions, giving him elbows to make him speed up and move on to questions or subjects of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strangely prescient look on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computer science.
It is one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there is something crude and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then implements them.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable Lost Interview sequences:
How he learned how to run a business:
"During all these years, I have always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because you have to do them.'"
No one knows why, no one is thinking deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details of his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how the costs were recorded - it often starts with a "standard cost" evaluated with a nose view, and then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated plant that guaranteed the precise calculation of the commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to hack telephone networks and phone for free in long distance.
The aircraft was the subject of many writings in advance, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball of different things a half-dozen times and you screamed on the public phone and it happened to you a minute later on the public phone next door," Jobs said laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We didn't know much about both of us, but we knew how to invent a little thing capable of controlling great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by recounting a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go crazy laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love of technology (and stand-out of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and made a phone call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a little cathode tube, and I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a head start.
At the beginning of his career, as he moved in to sell some printed circuit boards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, he would have to take care of the assembly and the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big fights... I was yelled at pretending it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 that was incredibly reliable.
On large companies that are suffocating:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders were going to be wrong and lose control of their market share.
"Let's admit that you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and then?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [it is these types of people] who end up leading companies and the specialized personnel in product are excluded from decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can't imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the required manual work.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
She could have made ten times her current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat to victory.
Innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge piece of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
There are compromises to make... some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories can.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by bringing them together.
Finally, the decisions are made by personal taste. It's about trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and that great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with health law opponents while the court meets
On the day when the Supreme Court met in private to discuss the issue of political discord, namely whether the opposition to the law of President Obama's health will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case before the high court.
The event was held last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases in question concerned a trial by 26 States challenging the reform of ambitious health care adopted by Congress last year, a law that was a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5:30 am is expected in March, and the result will likely be conducive to the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be booming when the court's decision is rendered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the rejection of the law, will likely be Paul Clement, who served as the solicitor general of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The law firm of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society (Federalist Society), a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another cabinet that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the commercial associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another proponent was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial challenge in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among other things, there was Mitch McConnell, the Senate's Republican top and declared opponent of the health law.
The star guests at dinner?
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct governing the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would doubtless argue by Canon 4C's code, which states: "A judge may attend fundraisers of law-related and other organizations although the judge may not be an intervener, a guest of honor, or on the agenda of such an event".
However, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was sufficient to alarm government ethics activists.
"This breach of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and had dinner and a gala fundraiser with lawyers who had cases pending before the court."
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event disassembly any claims of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for critics claiming that they too easily mix court business with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a conservative high-profile activist.
The Conservatives also claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the general solicitor for Obama's administration when the first opposition to the law was brought to the court of first instance.
His critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying that she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for line aircraft
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, two-way aircraft, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated market of over $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order containing 50 of its products.
On the other hand, it is quite a case when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record amount of $18 billion.
Equally incredible is whose Boeing received this command: the Middle East, a growing gold mine from future aircraft orders.
In Monday's forecasts, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion in the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing informed about the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-couliers.
It was the Emirates airline based in Dubai that passed this Pharaohic command.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to purchase 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated Monday that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, known as Dreamliners, a model that flatters itself with significant fuel and convenience savings for passengers.
These six aircraft amount to more than $1 billion.
"It's clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
They therefore not only have the means to pay for these aircraft, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their aircraft orders when the price of oil increases, Dihora said.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
The Emirates command reinforces Boeing's dominance in the wholesale carrier aircraft market and helps to curb the Airbus competitor's attempt to interfere with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the Aeronautics Fair comes four months after Airbus' announcement to postpone the beginnings of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus pushes back its beginnings to increase its momentum as customers demand to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister clearly beaten in the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race to the post of governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to access the Michoacán governorship in violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the head of the race as governor of that western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the entire country," said Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio during an interview the Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election officers... they took the ballot boxes, installed roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have distinguished itself only a few Calderon, who was at the head of the polls before the day of the election.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother's Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the functions of governor, arrived third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine trafficking.
This is the State of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence persisted.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates dropped out of the campaign locally because of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging in view of next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to come to support the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Managing Director of the Manila-based BASD, said that the two fastest growing economic powers in the world must "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would avoid a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"Therefore anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but it is not safe."
"So if China and India can help, there's nothing to stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan is dangerously high and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The booming crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has raised the fear that the world economy will return to recession, and prompted the major emerging economies to meet to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Nag argued that the IMF would deliver all Asian aid, but he also stated that this bilateral assistance - such as purchasing the bonds of the United States financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided greater negotiating power to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a slowdown in foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help rich Europeans while facing their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get aid to Europe to 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live with 2 dollars a day or less.
"One day they'll find that the Greeks retire at 50 and go on vacation in the sun and they'll find it hard to swallow," he said.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the railway sector.
Mr. Nag said that the euro area crisis could cause "significant repercussions" across Asia.
BASD's forecasts of economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 are now facing "loss risks" because of the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "develop " relief plans" to protect themselves from economic reversal and major capital flight.
Severe Pentagon warnings on potential defence reductions
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta put pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. He triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields of Afghanistan, through civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon already digests $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but is now concerned that an additional $600 or more cuts will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a resultant budgetary agreement in what is called sequestration would result in 23% reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
"A reduction of this size, applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and construction projects unfulfilled - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and seriously undermine other modernization efforts, " writes Panetta to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay to achieve the goal."
"These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, continues Panetta.
"Although wartime funding of foreign contingency accounts is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in the core budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support war."
"The staff managing wages would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war providers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a sequestration of the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline in the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power."
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," Senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"It is not a consequence that we can live with, and it is certainly not the one that we should impose."
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
That Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he himself has reached the top position of the Pentagon with years of budget expertise at Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what might happen - a soldier with a shell, but no nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that have not enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed force, poorly prepared and incapable of dealing with potential opponents."
"In fact, she invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: delay in responding to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limitations on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could go to the cutting edge, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the Army and Navy.
Putting an end to the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the recent headlines indicates the extent to which deception and lies are omnipresent in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators were accused of perjury for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The member of the New York Congress and famous Internet Anthony Weiner, went for an idiot by quickly emitting denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with violations of the funding of campaigns related to the coverage of an extramarital relationship.
And then, none of the one who has lived the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers have given the test answers to students in order to get a good look at their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are godly lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the aim is to cry out: "I have had you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted a thorough research of such projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been demystified.
The liars look you in the eye.
They don't stutter, blush, or shake all the time.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, the facial micro-expressions, the formation of the question and the response time.
I spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are able to read well others, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "centered on them" while women say more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - than married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a unbeliever, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "setting baseline data."
This helps to provide a reference point for measuring subsequent changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, laughter, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally shakes his feet permanently so as not to make unfair accusations when you see him shake his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of misleading verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, lean towards an exit, change posture significantly or present a relief from "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all difficult questions have passed.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is finished just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson derailed by using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a distant language: "I have not had sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or completely repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the response perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be revoked after the United States threat of late approval
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - raising the anger of trade unions while soothing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the oil pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said on Monday night that it will move the projected pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Capitole du Nebraska.
TransCanada's official, Alex Pourbax, says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval from an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, vast sources of groundwater.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican at Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would likely have pushed back any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied the policy involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the State Department, and expressed his support for it.
The 2.735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the Texas refineries.
In order to do so, it would have to cross six States.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have invested on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But the Nebraska legislators opposed this plan put pressure on a law to force the remoteness of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only pose limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would be a conflict of interest to the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice in its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A family in New York claims that the Diva Disco Patti LaBelle launched in a violent outbreak in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she threw up in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade scared little Geneviève Monk 18 months old, to such an extent that she suffered "personal changes, sleep disturbances" and "the increased fear of strangers," says her family during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down into the hall of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and laid her daughter for a while.
"Someone came behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and I went to get her," she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman with anger.
"She told me with an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter by the door," says Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "What you say or think I'm not interested."
She became angry and began to use vows - the word "" and the word """ of a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying me with the water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who was still holding Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her entourage who drove her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started throwing up, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note requesting an apology from LaBelle, but did not get any answers.
Lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis stated that he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money received to a charity work against cancer for children.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
In the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has decreased and the economy has contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-called of change, which has generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing losses of billions for the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of assignments by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there was damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remainder of 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity has led to a steady increase in unemployment in the State until November, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment of the State during the first three quarters of the year has been observed, as while from January to March 55 thousand and 053 Signanoens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate has become 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average has continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand Signanoens unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multi-factory, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we see is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work to win them, to invest them and to use them in something," he says.
Migration in custody
López Cervantes reported that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state to go to work abroad, in the United States has been limited, first because of the difficulties of entry and second because when they enter they already have a lot of difficulty in finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the labour market in signaroen is worsening considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates between the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the state's shift is the low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecasting.
The average monthly earnings of the workers of Signano were, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
FDI contraction
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction in Direct Foreign Investment over the past 10 years, according to the Economy Secretariat from January to June, State FDI reached $630 thousand,697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to the $5,143,000,312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, mainly recorded by companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
In view of the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State requested in July the approval of a 3 billion pesos loan for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 billion pesos and until November no debt benefits were observed in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the employer sector, Mario López Valdés' first year of government demonstrates a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wishes of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year was really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we had to align the effort of all and above all the good work already synchronized of this new government team, hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as the frosts of the beginning of the year have retained the economy of the state and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level of flow in trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close well below the expectations we had," he says.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said that we want to channel the state to productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important that we detonate the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources," he says.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that better channels the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in the management of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that there has been a lot of work and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still a lot to be done," he said.
Convicted for 8 kilos of marijuana
A person residing in Novolato was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and 100 days' fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic has informed that the small convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for an offence against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for sale.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small dealer was circulating in a white pick-up truck, in which he carried a black bag in the luggage carrier of the vehicle and in the copilot's place a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements were made available to the Second Judge of the District and the convicted person is still in the Judicial Consequences of Crime Execution Centre.
Debts on contributions to works
Social works included in programmes such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 para-migrants may not be completed where serious delays due to lack of economic resources are recorded, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although construction programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He noted that in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so there is a possibility of delay in their completion.
"They have to make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they have given us nothing, even though since July they had to give us a part of it," he says, "and we, in order not to record delays, have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already undergone this in the previous sexnnal period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to operate and this year, in order to have access to these programs, we had to obtain the resources to cover what the State had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the State authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had applied to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management so that the corresponding percentages would arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have given us nothing."
The Court valids "analogue cut" in Mexico in 2015
Substitution of analog signals by digitals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has rejected the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogue cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight necessary votes to invalidate it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was rejected for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft award, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the decree's declaration as non-constitutional, because the regulations on radio and television are a statutory assignment to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero were voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all its actions for the digital transition.
The plenary session of ministers also decided to dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project that Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible for.
In his intervention, the Minister President said that he disagreed with the project's arguments, in that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for public administration to prepare for it.
"I do not consider that it would affect the autonomy of the regulator," he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate to lead the state.
The substitution of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this results in better exploitation of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitisation which implies a decision of public interest that not only has a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "requiring the operation of a whole system establishes, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of attributions that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries from all over the world have already completed the digital transition and have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has in a form invaded the sphere of competence of the Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere the respect of the laws issued by the Legislature, he said.
The possibility of a "vote by vote" account in Michoacán is analysed
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of the "vote by vote" count is a reality with regard to the election process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not approve his Political Constitution, the Electoral Code of State or the Electoral Justice Act, while the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period for this electoral trial to come into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed to publish it within the time limits provided for in the Law of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislature and called it "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state's representative for constitutional reforms, because he does not have the right to "sanction or challenge them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out the partial and total counts of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting in the ballot paper is not found in the president of the ballot; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all ballot boxes may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the supposed candidate winning the respective election and the candidate who obtained the second place in the election is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the party representative and/or coalition who presented the second of the candidates reported.
The total counting of the ballot may also be achieved if, at the end of the joint counting, it results that the difference between the candidate presumed to be winning and the candidate of the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the representative of the political party whose candidate has emerged second, in which case electoral packages which have been the subject of the partial counting will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PRSP, the difference between the first and second places is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
Its ashes will be spread in the Zapalinamé mountain range, confirms the family.
The remains of the driver Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday towards the night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a mass of requiem.
According to his family, the last intention of the lieutenant-colonel was to spread his ashes in the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After receiving the tributes from other people to die in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on the edge of an aircraft of the Mexican Air Forces, the closest ones attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant-colonel arrived at the wake of the Nazario Ortiz Garza boulevard, where the family and friends surrendered.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes to the Technological Institute of Saltillo, organized by his former colleagues of technological baccalaureate and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was part when he was preparing for baccalaureate.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and let his ashes be spread out in the Zapalinamé mountain range, he always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all her dreams, she considers that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and he meant much to his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to register at the College of Air in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some people couldn't believe it, because they said he even had a bad truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His last farewell
With honours it was said goodbye to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, a tribute that led Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Technological Institute of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, alongside the Secretary of Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all of whom were staff members.
The remains of the Batio Cortés pilot born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other parents, students and teachers.
Three abandoned corpses, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had brought before the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes relating to organized crimes.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with the coup d' grace, in an abandoned property of Cadereyta Jiménez municipality, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at kilometre 1.5 of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who went through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has beige color and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, about three metres away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
At a distance there was another person's body with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were spread over the belly.
According to on-site data, the three people had been murdered in another location because no in-situ casings were found.
In the closing of the property there were legends directed by a crime group organized towards the other, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence made the presentation of 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to be related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the information published, in a first act on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony eight people were arrested and managed to save one who had been deprived of liberty.
They were confiscated three buildings and one cell phone; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another fact that took place on November 12 at 06:00 hours, military personnel took a surveillance course in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without registration plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a loader and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13 at 2 p.m. one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are assigned clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the whole Eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in its majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the result of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well drawn," he added.
Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normally, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels impossible to sustain.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Highlighting the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the performance of the Italian bonds BTP at 10 years over 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success have been greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which forced the crisis to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the technocrat majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He'll finish his meeting tour Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should persist until the forthcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement reforms before advancing the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that he should be trained only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have indicated that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spanish is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convened participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, when we compare the 22 countries convened by the two countries for today's amical, at 3:05 p.m., at the Stade National de San José.
While national and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, are counting an extensive register of class A inter-selection games, the Tricolor only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the First League of England maintain intense activity in national league and cup championships and fights in European Cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated playoffs of the European Cup and the World Cup football.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equalled the record of the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will now play against the Tricolor and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, a brain flyer from Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenaries of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the Schalke vanguard, Raúl González, with 102.
Centennial loan is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the Bryan Ruiz barker, with 45.
After that, only five have exceeded the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar only has one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not starting yet.
The historical scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in his turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to occur in this country.
It was that bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-decade work tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
On that day they will present themselves on the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 pm, next to the Los Angeles The X group and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose complete transcription is found in La Nación on the Internet.
For Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are living in?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I only spent the holidays in Costa Rica once; it is such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So we're excited to wear our music there.
I ask you, because there is some sort of devotion to the group, fans live intensely the previous days.
What is your message for your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us for all these years.
It took 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so long it had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the bigger shows we've been offering for the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have offered a two giant shows to Sao Paolo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of surfers friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned, through the people who love surfing.
When you see the tour, you're offering huge shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to do the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is the reason for this?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, which is why it's very difficult to choose which songs to play each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played for a long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved these songs and that we may have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined that we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we did it for over 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together emotions us a lot.
We love each other and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to form part of this group of major groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to form part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden on their tour, so we are lucky to be still friends with all of them and it is an honor for us to form part of that sound of Seattle that has emerged.
It is as strange that a group like yours remains united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much longer than many groups normally last.
Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and this could not be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are here for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect music and what brought it, without thinking about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which does not really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We've been a band for almost three years and we haven't released a record before Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration about the fact that she lasted so little and the most important thing is that we are still very close to Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The Las Robertas national group will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose him for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we liked the most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very distracting.
Why do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There's so much...
Among the first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about bassists that I love.
How did Pearl Jam keep the grunge up despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have emerged at the same time and, if this is relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's a music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney now make the best music ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even though these can sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think that if you grow up and there's trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and those songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even so we can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for loss of muscle strength in his feet, informed his family physician.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various conditions, including language cancer for which he has been operated four times and which is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, told Canal N of television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the remission of sentence for humanitarian reasons, he probably said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
Four times of tongue cancer was performed, there was a weight loss of 18 kg, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreas cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and foot circulation problems, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving detention since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squadron who operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political ties
An official procession, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and bosses, will launch a visit to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans resident in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "appropriate for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its web page.
According to the local media, Mujica tries to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when the French agent, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that led to the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador from that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world's strongest emerging and developed countries, and has in force with the South American country, since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements to emerge from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (FTA) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu plumber passes to the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought, tireless, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the wicked Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at the stores of everyone, was designed from the beginning to exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this support", as so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson argued that despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows a quick and fluid part.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang less skilled users.
Once overcome, the more experts will be able to make a second tour at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an aggressive "D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "successful to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a mobile console, which had not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo takes a look at the saga fans and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the moustachu plumber must go through platforms mined with perils to free Princess Peach.
Even if I play find new features in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom supports Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had given orders for the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of 70 million US dollars.
This concludes the trial so that Guatemala will respond to the request of the northern country that Portillo claimed to try it.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his term "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and he had dealt with all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did presupposes an executive approach after exhausting all judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former agent of the 2004-2004 interval.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and after having guaranteed his human rights.
Portillo was absolute for diversion of funds of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial prior to extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 youth at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The record of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter century.
In addition to this, there is the long centenary of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an act celebrated in a former industrial complex in Fabra i Coats where more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping people who are untrained, without work, with drug problems or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the full electoral season, showed the unitary nature of Trinijove's work.
Alongside the president of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former minister of socialist education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor and current municipal councillor eco-socialist Ricard Goma.
The present Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, were also present in the large hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present one is also, but he added that the work accomplished so far "is a good basis".
The president gave Trinijove as an example of how to fight against the bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-fests, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of number 51 of Rue Balmes lived has ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally occupying at noon yesterday, where they organized micro-fests that were desperating the neighbors, in court order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the lock of the door was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
"From this day on there will be a control of access," said the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took the electrical installation and part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of any kind, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass festivals, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied, her business fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made him unfairly competent, as they sold the glasses at three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreation facility had had to respond to complaints from the neighbors about the noise, while, according to the latter, the problems were not caused by the clients of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbors of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the troubles were so great that it even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since it "forgaves" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from the neighbors about this situation.
Alberto Fernández Díaz, president of the municipal group of the PP of the city hall, had requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the common and civic life problems that it caused the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all apartments and that in some apartments there were also flights.
It is in this sense that he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and be implacable against the antisocial behavior generated in the property".
Yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police moved to 35 Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of convocation beyond controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens again debate on Collserola's role in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), the Administration printed promotional posters for Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of Metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not move on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park otherwise Yellowstone, with straps in the role of Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
A door goes back to the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared on its own: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to the reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.
This is almost a recurring theme of which two members of this former caste of elect speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, have come forward.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the slopes of green houses has not been carried out at the end.
"It is necessary to start from the base that Barcelona's most extensive park is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the architect said, for which the title of "Collserola ports" contains a "lexic trap": one should not think of them as "access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which one must act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanistic world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some perils".
The perils that derive from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience lived in the 1980s and which had in the forum area "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step," that is, its overrun.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP)] can cause genuine disasters."
By sticking more to the question, Modol thinks that, by simplifying, the slope of the region El Valles de Collserola "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by Collserola's Patronage which "should not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the city council offers to its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe-conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("every success," he says) that we had to create: "We, architects, should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because from the bases of the competition there is a total vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 transversal competitions - he says - in the sense of the mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This, at least in this case, has chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project to allow one of the doors to crash in the program and define with that of the architect of the nearby door.
In its opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the band immediately superior to Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal authority of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmails
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the foundation of the legal power of the Casino Red grants him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack at Casino Royale, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay for an economic quota so that the Mayor of Monterrey would allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of Mayor PANiste and on 2 September he was arrested and held in pre-trial detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Prosecutor's Office 3 of Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
He remained there for the following 49 days when a second detention order was issued to him after the Public Prosecutor's Office officer dismissed the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta penal center allegedly for having blackmailed the owners of the Casino Red with a million and a half pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest warrant was issued by the Registrar of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonás' guilt, such as that relating to the 1.5 million pesos cashing of the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for its operation.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself before Judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the mayor's brother of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's Office officer attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who had been granted forgiveness by the gambling partners, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Under case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal was granted legal pardon and subsequently no claim for the trial against him could be made; no compensation for the damages and no punishment would be sought either.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been legally pardoned and his file would be closed.
He will also communicate the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácom gives the details of the air accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results highlighted on the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter struck directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so the unit met the requirements for transporting staff.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact zone do not report the appearance of rooms on the ground.
"In one search it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was presented structurally.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for transporting them.
The soil had a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
For the time being, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Chief Executive Officer of Aeroports and Auxiliary Services assured that the moment of impact, the Presidential Major State helicopter worked at cruising speed and it happened on a soft ground ascending.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal operation cruising at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, TBS incumbent Pérez Jácome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation regulations, the flight was conducted according to visual flight rules, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions for take-off, and as the aircraft advanced to the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were low-level nebulosity layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the conditions of nebulosity the crew sought a lower height area and more visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Localization of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remnants in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has taken place on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The aircraft remains dispersal model suggests that the helicopter struck the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No traces of fire or explosion were detected:
In the location of the disaster there is always no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, with a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disjointed along his journey.
The information provides evidence that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After careful search in a wider area than the surrounding area, around the accident, scattered parts of the aircraft were not found, which supports the presumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance directs an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, called the 'Genetic Protocol of Obesity of Children and Adolescents', which will allow the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the Head of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialty Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation invites the right-wing or non-right-wing population to attend the IMSS participating sports units in Valle de México, where the evidence is made to minors every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Sports Unit Cuauhtémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity takes place in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcoyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Independence Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Sports Morelos Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that of knowing the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and identifying risk factors for children and young Mexicans in order to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of the specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family heritage history of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic levels will be applied to all participants (an attempt is made to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in only six years there has been an increase, for boys, of 77 per cent in obesity and for girls of 47 per cent; for overweight there has also been a dramatic increase,' stressed the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent Indo-American heredity, 30 per cent European and 5 per cent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the full assessment of the children, which allows to detect whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the probability of suffering from metabolic and even pre-diabetes alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, the doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, who are informed of each of the measures and changes in their lifestyle to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - corn meal meat paste wrapped in corn leaves - bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid cassis
Rafael Herrera, researcher at UNAM's Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better yield, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the reports were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair approximately 200 thousand cassis each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous peacock is adequate, the cassis could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on cassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory to which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture having characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalts could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve the yield, and therefore the formation of the cassiums.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the paving its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, at almost 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes broken, he added.
This means that in the streets the asphalt resistance is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City were mostly covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involved asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that forms the layer, he pointed out, is bathed an asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating effort, it allows forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would spread better, thought the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he says, one last layer called rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
Since this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
As the part of the paving that receives and distributes the efforts, the rolling layer also requires that it be of adequate thickness and the material it is made of must be treated.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as they significantly affect asphalt layer performance.
When the soil is wet, the water pours inside the layer is difficult for it to come out, which softens all layers of the pavement and therefore causes the cassis.
In the process of forming a cassis, he said, the first one to be ruined is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of cassies and therefore the thickness of each layer of the paving must always be linked to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent formation of cassies.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair the cassions easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives title number 14 of Princess.
Once again Valle del Cauca has remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with the fact that she was on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that credited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is raised with the crown and sceptre, the department already has 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who found themselves near the crown but have been proclaimed princesses, among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people ask themselves is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of Police and Best Facing Jolie de Vogue, titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to designate her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Martín Murillo Gómez of Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of the candidate from Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Ardour of Blood".
This response did not please first because of the term "culturalization" and secondly not to explain in concrete terms how each book quoted had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony she said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what must happen is happening.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The little prince" is a great book.
Among the assumptions made are that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A Bogota journalist suggested that being the favorite, the ovationite and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (the challenge of gastronomy Oster, the public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she did not flirt on the stage".
And this was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Even though she seemed confident of herself at both shows, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program (Comme en la casa), of the Canal RCN said that the fact that Melina had been appointed princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most prizes during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why two days before the election, the international juror Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before beginning the Competition are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by her defects from her back and the fibrosis that was observed in her abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the body healthier, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Reindeer Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in fact for me had not been too well known, left her points on the last day".
Meanwhile journalist Guido Hoyos, from Cromos magazine, considers that the mistake of the Valle candidate was the surgery she had undergone.
"The surgeries are good, but Valle couldn't do them.
Her body has never been her asset and she has lost because of this aspect."
For this prize, which the National Beauty Competition brings back for the first time, after the swimsuit parade arose a cruel prediction that was carried out last night, it was said that this was a small gift Raymundo made to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that today Melina begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will pass into history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
So was the work of Cali's person who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Cali typewriter went into history like the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4, a typewriter from the Cali ITC passed into history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the Farcs: "Alfonso Cano", comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists working in the local offices of the ITC, this week was the "availability" of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the dead bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in typing, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar had been warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected of being the man who was leading the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the place of the body, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He didn't have a beard, he was dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian wolf, ink, a picker and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the one who confirmed to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the Farcs.
Looking for the fingerprint
For a typologist from Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, typists support investigations into crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher reported that in a case of theft he had to remove part of the wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to get out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the print from all hands and identify the offender who had participated in different flights," he recalls.
Fingerprints may also rule out or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
By means of the investigation, it was determined that a parent could be suspected of the crime and indeed a print on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee that he's the killer, it puts him on the scene of the crime.
A CTI typewriter explained that "the fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents" are extracted.
When they appear, a picker or tape is used to pick them up.
Subsequently, the prints are sent to Asif, the database of the declines, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of undocumented Colombians," said the ITC expert.
He explained that everything is not how it is shown in the CSI television program.
Like everything that shines isn't gold, everything you touch doesn't necessarily become a print.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "indigns" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters roamed in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the population accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to re-enter, through a court order, instead of Manhattan, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park in the Great Apple.
Hundreds of protesters roamed in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access through a court order that allows 'indignant' to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the Occupy Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the 'indigns' to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Justice Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indigns' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some protesters, even though Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, ensuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in as a sign of support to the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favor of them before the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private-owned chamber - remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analysed.
Some protesters who had been displaced to that point were carrying and distributing copies of this court order at that time and even handing it over to the agents who were watching the square, which caused 'some small clashes', Bray said, who denounced the fact that some officials struck the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating the members of Occupy Wall Street or from applying 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or from prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with tents or other properties they used before'.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, as a result of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, but warned that local laws did not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn in Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided because the demonstrators 'violate the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate laws and in some cases, to hurt others", because "some shops had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation of this morning at dawn has been repugnant and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accuses the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
Officials of Occupy Wall Street also indicated that they do not plan to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television program by Noel
Aside from Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a helper in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Canadian television Christmas program.
The private television channel CTV today announced that Anderson, next to the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide dissemination on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting in a nursery a doll that represents Jesus.
On the stage, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian actor who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth," appeared as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Noel program also features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "pute" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Reigns After Earthquake
GDP rose by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ended the fall spiral in early March
Since March the Japanese economy has been paralysed, convalescent even after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country since the Second World War.
The first estimates by the Government of Tokyo have calculated material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have diminished.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September were used to turn the page permanently: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rates.
The second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of increase from January to March 2010.
Recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the post-tsunami earthquake.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of unbroken growth.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that calls for taking advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructure, to use the deficiencies to grow from zero.
Japan woke up mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "security value havens" elected by investors fleeing the Eurozone debt crisis and the United States forecast disturbances, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger divide, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, took responsibility for their poor results between July and September for the yen's contribution.
While markets continue to remain in peripheral EU countries, Yoshihiko Noda's government does not decrease custody.
"We must monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) mentioned that the majority of member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are constrained.
Because it dropped four decimals to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone has even been below the average, which is in level 100, with eight decimal places down to 99.13 points.
Athens again feeds doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to interfere in the maze that leads to the exit from the great crisis of European debt.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels than by a real conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos pointed out yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period established in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his requirement for new elections for the scheduled date, that of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not raise doubts about his position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are not committed to anything else".
The conservative leader has gone a step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the bodies that need to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to carry out the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the vantage of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stresses Spain's "preponderant" place with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a prominent place at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that in the past two decades the country has become the world's second largest donor in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the 2015 United Nations Millennium Goals and, "very specifically, in the one that aims to halve the volume of people living with income under one dollar per day, to which the "poverty threshold" is set.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in every corner of the world, and undertakes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that initiatives and inputs originating during the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "achieved many goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is envisaged not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to push "two basic goals".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that at the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are coming out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impulse in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized Queen Sofia as a "act of justice and recognition due".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she has known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to know her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," said Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought yesterday the qualifier of "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid by the "banking of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In that regard, she explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits imply "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work on solidarity criteria and not let it be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the "excluded" people to whom all closed the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors of the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also President of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme but was imposed in the autumn, especially to satisfy the activists who consider the government's policy too lax with regard to the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The several-minute stand-by that they were entitled to after their speeches, Angela Merkel, and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The idea-master of the Chancellor - and of the motion - holds in a slogan: the answer to the crisis "is no less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come from a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the EU's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but this could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe".
This is, in any case, one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, the inspirator of which is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight each country's weight at the European Central Bank's Executive Board according to the weight of each economy, which was obviously a matter of increasing Germany's weight.
In an effort to calm the climate within her party, the chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but she has also not sought to win her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty prompt to criticize the arrogant Germany.
While the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the middle of nowhere.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud at the time of illness?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launch the disease stop offensive.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a family allowance fund, and to deliver a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less indicative of an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on the sick stops.
Firstly, for the purpose of budget savings: the government plans to impose a fourth day's deficit on employees of the private sector before taking over a work stoppage.
Clearly, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' pay, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could provoke anger, but which would bring back 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic scope: to impose on civil servants a day of non-compensation in the event of a stoppage of work (they do not have until now a period of deprivation, as opposed to three days in the private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also re-launches the issue of fraud, focusing this time on the abuses linked to work stoppages.
"Controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will refund," warned Xavier Bertrand at the RTL microphone on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the advertising effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraud at work.
It has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, most of which have borne fruit.
The French are no more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us focus first on national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% concerned sick leave, or EUR 6.2 billion.
And so 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any sick days.
Another study, this time of Sickness Insurance , states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more inclined than elsewhere to stop work.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) in France ranged between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sickness fraud represents very little in the face of work in the dark.
As for fraud, it only reaches a small extent.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 makes systematic checks on sick leave more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of the 285 000 completed for short-term stops were "unwarranted or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of stops of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% "unadapted or unjustified" cases out of 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, therefore, 169,000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million employees who had had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little, for example, compared to work in the dark.
According to MP UMP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on the issue in June, the latter would represent 9-15 billion euros of tax loss per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than the fraud of the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
This is what the Prime Minister, Lucas Papadémos, said Monday, November 14, in front of Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his union government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue the economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new fiscal adjustment programme," said the head of government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr Papadémos has foreseen that the country's public deficit will be reduced to "about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, gave his support on Monday to the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to an additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary 8 billion euro loan without written assurance from all parties that they would support the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his speech was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says a committee of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to a patient who is deemed competent to make such a decision.
From the outset, experts cite a recent survey of the Economy Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
If Canada has ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we report experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite most Canadians' desire to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
This rate is highest in Quebec overall, with 86% of the deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide assisted by non-competent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, would find more cases of these overflows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
It should be recalled that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it would allow end-of-life people to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of older or disabled people have less value.
As for those who have committed assisted suicide, the respondents estimate that 41% should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or cessation of care to a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors say.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that the Criminal Code should indicate that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect a denial of end-of-life care without fear of criminal prosecution.
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Finally, in terms of palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee asks that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same procedures.
Reservations by other experts
Some health law experts have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described as "extreme" the position of the experts who signed the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill.
"It opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide," said Mr.Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
"In society," he says, "there are signs and constraints."
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the findings of the report, which she described as "pro-euthanasia manifesta".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, challenges in particular the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, either in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Damas denounces a "comlot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry's premises.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on the Syria of Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists and denounces a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League's suspension of Syria, the European Union reinforced its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took a position in favour of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "lose power" in Syria where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces were still killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have resulted in a failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country in which Turkey adopts an increasingly harsh line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces perished in the region of Deraa, in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians perished "when shooting and firing at heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem, however, felt that the country was "directing towards the end of the crisis".
He responded strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said constituted a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not shrink," he added, ensuring that "the horrid plot against Syria will fail".
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from repression of the regime, which he believes is locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities facing the challenge and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, said yesterday that the decision of the Arab League was "incorrect", while China called on Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while refraining from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti takes time to markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has demanded a little time in the markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting with the trade unions and employers today.
It should put in place a relatively limited cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, MP of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the President of the Designated Council.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, probably a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are specific deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying "certainly that markets will be patient and will understand".
Its designation by the President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern resumed particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated Prime Minister should be a team that includes mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "policies".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the next legislative date, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti has committed himself, once he has taken office, to work in the urgency and with the aim that Italy "become a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance objective in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further rigorous measures in particular.
The Italian "patron of bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that does not have growth cannot meet the deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and a "other Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, because Italy must place by April 2012 200 billion euros of state bonds.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, said an American NGO specialized in atomic risk on Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported last week on its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS drawing largely from IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, reportedly worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk, Ural, and was allegedly involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then reportedly cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA mentions "high indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "has been assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but, as a member State informed the Agency, has worked for the most part on this technology within its home country's military nuclear programme".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence at the same time decreased slightly or little progress, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase, compared with a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by race differences and 20% by religion differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," said Human rights organization First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a press release.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the organization's officials, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses," he adds, believing that this could be achieved by improving police reports on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence related to race, skin colour, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter micro-blogging site introduced changes on Monday in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service a little more similar to that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to follow more legibly, live the activity of the other "Twittos", the Internet users who follow the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows you to know if they are following messages, whether they subscribe to new accounts, whether they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter format was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast across the network Monday, told AFP Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend following another user) doing the happiness of the initiates, opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the Facebook and Google+ general public networks.
On the network, users were discussing "tweets" decided on the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too Facebook-like," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter feed," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
Incorporation of a budgetary "golden rule" into the constitution
The government of large-scale social-democratic-Christian coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a budgetary "gold rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid any deterioration by the rating agencies of the sovereign note of Austria (triple A).
It is the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision at the end of a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was lowered by only one cran, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros more interest each year," said Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democrat Minister for Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request by the summit in Brussels from the euro area countries on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian Government is closer to the "German model", Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, starting in 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to increase public debt to 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen strong
Noda threatens a new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in the exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate," Noda explained in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen went up close to the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massive yen against dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just established a new record of vigor since 1945 in front of the green ticket.
But the yen has been regularly raised since, coupled with purchases of investors who regard it as a "value refuge" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar returned Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro descended under the symbolic bar of the 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar stood at around 120 yen and the euro at over 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency undermines the exports of the archipelago as it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of income derived from abroad by Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan has been struggling to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), emphasized Mr. Noda who fears that this increase in the yen will kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The third world economic power revived with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of households driven by disaster.
But the Prime Minister found that the yen's price did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened Tuesday a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (€47 billion) to 55,000 billion yen (€519 billion) the ceiling on the amounts it spends on the purchase of various financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
The rates are rising, the stock exchanges are flinching
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of fragile countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are sinking a little more into negative territory this Tuesday 15 November.
At 10 a.m. in Paris, CAC 40 loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt gives way 0.4% and London 0.1%.
" With new tensions over the yields of borrowing from the euro area states in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains. "
" Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion, " explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed down by 0.7%, suffering in turn from renewed fears from market players about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
" Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a narrowly varied corridor until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized, " says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been evolving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it withdrew after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of the Italian bonds at 10 years reached 6.85%, that of the Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over interest rates in the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the speakers.
The leader of the future Italian government Mario Monti called for time in the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is on the market line, while parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The rate gap ("spread") between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new higher historical level.
Pending growth figures for the euro area
On the statistical side, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
However, the Insee revised the figure for the second quarter downwards, with a 0.1 per cent decline in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it's really the fourth one that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must prevail over dogmas
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or under emotion, it is indeed energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is wise that an election meeting should be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place of nuclear power.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic change will lead to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless we deprive a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, fossil resources will need to be reduced in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a subject that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
This is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
It is not the case either of Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor of Switzerland, which just intends to build only last generation power plants.
In contrast, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States, they, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by restarting the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focused on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts discourse.
The choice of Berlin will result in higher electricity prices, an energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a leap in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal power plants.
In a few months, all these unfortunate effects have already been felt.
The case of Denmark is to be measured.
He is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to wind intermittence; according to which his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average, respectively.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill of 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would lead to a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make the fine declarations on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power illusory.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show any opposition in principle to this energy, the polls show it.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has helped to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Highly exportative, it leads to a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and makes them very creative of non-replaceable jobs.
If France were to decide to get out of nuclear power, it would be to sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the annual €6 billion of French exports of nuclear equipment and services as a painstaking skin.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run sixty years while its manufacturer's decline would be programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miracle electricity production, nor is there any devil.
The development by Areva of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
We have in France a Safety Authority that exercises intransigent and transparent control over existing power plants as well as on the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same safety obsession.
In half a century, the nuclear industry experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two unprecedented natural disasters that have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it had done for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the safety authorities, the operators and the French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a concept that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all the electricians who want to build a power plant, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the free way to seize leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such a crucial debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy conducted under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the involvement of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has been the subject of the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of May 23rd) proclaiming in the passage that France "does not need foreign talent, masons and restaurant servers".
But it is only rarely analysed from the economic angle.
It is that there is a fairly broad consensus on this subject between left and right.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't accommodate the whole misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left as on the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be given to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confines himself to trivialities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be paid electorally; but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book summarizing the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting anemia immigration growth and hindering employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may replace national workers, especially the low-skilled, with downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mainly in occupations in sectors with a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the supply of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country with a shortage of anaesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make immigrants' arrivals have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows leads to an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of real long-term wages.
This does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution (less-expenditure revenue) of EUR 150000 to public budgets on average over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to look for the missing growth points "with teeth".
The teeth in question, used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, has experienced throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some have been able to believe that it would be sufficient, for democracy to triumph definitively of its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way.
It has been known since Napoleon "the Little", that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can even become "an instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, light, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first of all a crisis of politics and democracy.
In this respect, the palinody of the true Greek referendum will have had double revealing value: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now moved, and for many of them Republican soldiers are no longer heading in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in scattered order.
A white-seing to the absolute monarch of Europe or a leap on foot joined in the void of the nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cutlery, but we want a common, rightful, calm and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - there is no way to stop listing - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bends to the diktats of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give the people's sovereignty back the control of the European project.
For it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, except of course leading us to disaster.
After long fighting this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
All right.
But thinking without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The revolution in interests could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe politically, a true European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, we make Europeans.
Smart cards "without contact" are generalised
The world show of smart card opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an increase of 11% in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important segment is that of contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or to pay for your purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards should be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global smart card market (6.925 million cards).
For a long time behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for non-contact payment.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put double bites.
Carrefour has thus issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards without contact this year.
To move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two large French establishments have committed themselves to systematically disseminate to their customers bank cards equipped for the contactless", announced Gérard Nebouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Mobile Payment
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally know a real growth next year."
"We are counting on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Farm Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case allowing the payment without contact.
The OPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, too, said yesterday to prepare the placing on the market of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front spreads
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Suspected for a long time, the links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have revealed the gateways.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French Special Forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the calls made leads to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram and the other to a man who claims to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect has received external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in his operating methods, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices and the same invoice as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, beginning with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illumined, unworthy of interest.
A Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haussa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in north-Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is very successful.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for the sharia while its militants engage in the fight against the ruthless central government.
The latter are aimed first at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army is investing in the city, we have 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, was killed in prison.
Hence the sect will radicalize and leave its northern fiefs.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it was again in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the police's secure HQ during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria is now a matter of concern to all security specialists.
As Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, as al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete for simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe it.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have been multiplying the tonicing statements and short cuts in foreign policy, traditionally a very republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsupported - merge.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and challenge them "for manipulation of their currency", a theme that carries in an America exasperated by the migration of whole loaves from its industry to Asia.
Whether this should involve the outbreak of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former Chinese ambassador and only candidate for a sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost strangled himself in the face of an attitude that "flattens" emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who straddles the depth of the polls, remains inaudible.
Like Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, did he fanfare."
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "tryes to develop nuclear capability" - apparently ignoring the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, said he was ready to engage the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We're far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy-duty foreign policy driver.
The opponents of the current president replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in terms of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the "boys" of Iraq, on his misconceptions in Libya, thus attaching a weak label to it.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The population is rather positive about Obama's national security record, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been wary of military interventions that lead to enslavement.
And, arguing that we need to rebuild America economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
North Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, directly connecting Western Europe to Russia by going to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brilliance.
More than 500 guests of whom four heads of state and government participated on the Baltic coast last Tuesday, between orchestra and fine buffet, at the inauguration of the North Stream, this new pipeline that directly connects Russia to Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte together turned the steering wheel of the valve commanding the entry of Russian gas into the western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe with a first 1,224 km tube linking the St Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube is to be completed by the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third one on the same path.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge construction project looks like victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close their access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of Europe's energy, as the project has created a break between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas-consuming, and whose deposits are declining.
" This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically, " confirmed François Fillon by inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating how political and economic major gas contracts are.
All this explains the wide smiles displayed by Gazprom leaders, present in number in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-coated steel to protect it from anchors of ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the Second World War.
" A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
There was also a need to increase measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts throughout its length: no valve, no maintenance station.
A monitoring platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project officials gave up while the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state-owned company permanently set up off their coasts.
" In case of damage, we stop the gas passage in less than a minute, " says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline is therefore leaked into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have planned the welds for a leak every 100,000 years.
Monitoring the condition of the pipeline is carried out by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by a device circulating inside the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is inserted inside the tube, width of one meter in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters second, it delivers precise information on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo any repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who keeps 51% of the shares.
The German E.ON and BASF (15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each) joined.
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to this company, for twenty years renewable, the full capacity of gas transport.
" Gazprom will pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported, " says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach € 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their costs, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pines.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the exit door of the gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas coming before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has received one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour passing.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand name book.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
He has a scent of adventures, of hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, elastic, broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine Carnet as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design notebook but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin (tupee skin) which means a varnished cotton used to cover banquets, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travellers.
" Moleskine has restored to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century " , says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand at Modo Modo.
The success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a robot portrait of the buyer, as the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, counts almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from Fnac to small downtown shops and has been able to impose her identity.
"We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebooks.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer covers... The brand is available on a wide range of media.
A success that has made us envious: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the SG Capital Europe investment fund, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people opens today.
Despite a voluntary public policy established in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the general population.
Dishearsing?
" No, " says Éric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled. "
" The progress made over the past fifteen years is considerable. "
" At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher. "
" Nevertheless, much remains to be done. "
It has to be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, there are still many obstacles before access to employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the baccalaureate and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to an average of 38%.
In short, so many criteria which make it particularly difficult to return to employment, and which " constitute the node of the problem", according to Christian Grabin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That's for objective brakes.
It remains the unsaid, the attitudes that change, of course, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité association indicated that the managers interviewed have "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual deficits".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set out in a law of... 1987.
The last known figures, which date back to 2008, indicate a ratio of 2.6%.
" We are now around 3%, " says Pierre Blanc, Director General of the Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
" The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, " explains Pierre Blanc. "
" But this improvement also translates into real awareness, especially in large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "Happiness"
Before facing the Blues Tuesday night (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We don't go until we write that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard did indeed make peace.
Five months after the mood of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian breeder has only praises for him.
"I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go ahead," says Lillois.
As for the contrast between his performances in club and in selection, "it is a whole, it is justified."
"In Lille, I am there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Threatened against Romania Friday night in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "briller".
However, without omitting the notion of "pleasing".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supportive," he says.
This must be done in order to further strengthen the "special" character of this meeting.
Especially since in front, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he rapelled.
"We ran into each other earlier."
"To be able to play against them is only happiness!"
With good name, Leekens spoke of the "party."
"Fierty" to fight "a gala game."
"Fierté" also to note - as a "neighbour" - that France is "renewed a very high-level team" a little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a thunder job," he got excited.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be able to share the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are getting big," he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll find out about it in the next games." The one against France included.
Portugal very confident
Portugal of Paulo Bento starts with a lot of optimism its dam back in front of Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, the two teams lacked realism.
" At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country. "
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, whose handles it has been in since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to unload.
In view of the game going (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seemed obvious that the games were not done.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to mark this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
" This is a good result, but it has a certain risk because we have not scored a goal on the outside "
But at home, in their bright stadium of Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there so boiling, even though the part is obviously "very tight", said a bright but lucid Bento.
" We expect a very tight game, but we are quite convinced that we can take over, " said the 42 - year - old Portuguese coach.
" We continue to have a 50% chance of being at the Euro 2012, " nevertheless relativized Carlos Queiroz' successor.
The zero reported Friday of Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A zero can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
" This is a good result, but it has a certain risk because we have not scored a goal on the outside, " regrets Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not give them time to think. "
A good idea, provided it's realistic this time.
