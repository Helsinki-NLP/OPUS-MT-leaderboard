Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law establishing administrative liability for violation of the time and procedure for payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for public and municipal needs.
The Act is intended to address the very acute problem of non-performance by customers in public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs could not receive payment under State and municipal contracts already executed was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation to take special control of the problem.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unfair employers who entered into unfunded contracts, tried to evade their obligations to pay and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, 9,700 submissions have been made by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, as a result of which 4,500 officials have been brought to disciplinary proceedings, 533 administrative officials have been prosecuted, 75 materials have been submitted to the investigative bodies for the conduct of procedural checks, and 46 criminal proceedings have been initiated.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
These huge amounts were not accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion-dollar contracts.
Many, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts have led to massive debts.
Here's the case.
The head of a small company won a competition for several million roubles in social transport services.
The person invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but did not receive the money due on time.
The result is an increasing financial comm of salary, tax, credit debts that would have led to bankruptcy had the entrepreneur not sought assistance from the prosecutor's office.
The problem has now been reduced as much as possible in a number of regions.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt on State and municipal contracts identified by the prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to rise to critical levels, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office operates under a manual crisis management regime.
The Attorney-General personally holds field meetings with local authorities to deal with all violations discovered by prosecutors in a substantive manner and to remedy them immediately.
Such operational meetings have already taken place in Jaroslavla and Yekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of Federal Act No. 189-FZ "On the amendment of the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation with regard to the establishment of administrative liability of the employer's officials for violation of the time and procedure for the payment of goods (work and services) in procurement to meet State and municipal needs", which was signed last week by the President of the Russian Federation, will improve the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law was prepared by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia at the initiative of the Office of the Procurator-General.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences with an article which provides for a fine of between 30,000 and 50,000 roubles for breaching the terms and procedure of payment of goods, works and services by the employer ' s official in State and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been subject to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he or she will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure that these legislative innovations are applied in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Unit has issued a move warning to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to coloured people travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads as follows: "Prevention for travelers of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Population, which is valid until 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, guests and Missouri citizens to be particularly careful and careful in travelling across the state in connection with a number of questionable racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the state and that have been brought here."
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the announcement of a travel warning to the group prompted the recent Missouri law, which made it more difficult for people to win discrimination suits, and that State law enforcement agencies were disproportionately targeting minorities.
"You have people who are being subjected to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of the colour of their skin, beaten and killed," reported the newspaper Kansas City Star, Rod Chapel, President of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population of Missouri.
"We hear complaints more often than ever before."
This is the first such warning announced by the organization to the United States.
The Panel referred to incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at Missouri University and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas on his trip to the state, and the Missouri State Police arrested him without charging him with a crime.
The warning also refers to a recent report from the Missouri State Attorney General's Office that black drivers are 75 per cent more likely to be stopped on the road than white drivers.
"The purpose of the warning is to alert people to the situation and to alert their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be trained in one way or another whether they will take the money for bail or inform their relatives that they are travelling around the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI Hate Crimes Report Program, 100 hate crimes were reported in Missouri in 2015, making the state the sixteenth-largest in the state.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri State Act, which will make it more difficult to prosecute a legal person for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Union for the Defence of Civil Liberties (ACLU) had issued warnings to travelers in Texas and Arizona after the states had enacted new immigration control laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to ACLU, should have increased the number of racial checks.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but more recently, public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people died as a result of shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown men fired on a police patrol in the Egyptian town of Isna, reporting to Reuters with reference to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
Two people, including one policeman, were killed and three were injured during the shooting.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement personnel.
One of the perpetrators was detained, the other managed to escape.
Rostourism supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-refundable air tickets
The head of Ross Tourism, Oleg Safonov, stated in an interview with RBC, that "positive" was the enactment of a law to abolish the free carriage of baggage on non-refundable air tickets.
"It is necessary to create conditions in which a person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage," he stressed (TASS quote).
Mr. Safonov noted, however, that despite citizens ' fears, it would not be necessary to pay for the carriage of upper clothing and a mobile phone in a hand luggage.
"It would be right to calm all our citizens and tourists and say so, say it to the top of our clothes, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the iPad, or even to some computer," said the head of Rostourism.
Russian President Vladimir Putin had previously signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the rule of free baggage on a non-refundable airline ticket.
This means that airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of baggage included in the non-refundable tariff.
Vladimir Putin commissioned the elimination of Baykal pollution
Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting on the protection of Baikal, reported that large areas of the lake had been subject to extreme pollution in recent years.
It mandated the identification of sources of funding, plans and implementers for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin has also commissioned full remediation of contaminated areas.
"There is also a need to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the clean-up facilities of most of them are worn out," quote the President's RIA News.
He also added that the Office of the Procurator-General of Russia should carry out an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
In the lake area, he said, there were problems with the emergence of natural landfills and a number of environmental disturbances by recreational organizers.
"I want to stress this: not all checks must be checked, but there must also be a measure to be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and measures to be taken," he stressed.
In the past, Genprocuratur had reported a decline in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of sites subject to environmental supervision.
Once again, on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, in a direct line, stated the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of a special protection regime.
He was informed of economic problems by the inhabitants of the island of Oljón, which is part of the Baykal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donsk, immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baykal water protection zone, but the Buryatiya Government was reminded that such a change was not sufficient because the restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
Previously, the Ministry of Economic Affairs had proposed a solution to the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
There will be a new temple in the South
In the village of Sociwa, members of the community from the small indigenous peoples of the North, Rakhtyanya, are taking part in the construction of an Orthodox temple in honour of the saint Nikolai Wondermaker, together with the inhabitants of the Berezovsky district.
Its location is the river bank, and the temple will be well seen from afar, so it will serve as a beacon for fishermen.
According to community representatives, construction work will be completed this year, the dome is now in place and church bells are available.
The Fleet's playmates provided a transport escort.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas Wondermaker because he is honored by the Orthodox Church as a patron of travelers, including fishermen.
On the other hand, in the X, fishing gives settlers jobs and feeds them.
The locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it as a local sightseeing in school essays.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why does Singapore respect the law?
I'm talking to local businessman Chang, sitting in an open-air diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, butts carefully store an iron box with him from the office.
After the interview, the businessman goes to the nearest urn -- 100 meters to it -- and throws the bulls there.
A fine for garbage in a public place - $500 local, according to Chang.
You know, I've just had a reflex since I was a kid. You can't throw candy fantasies on a bridge, they're gonna get a fine.
And now there's video cameras everywhere.
Indeed, Singapore's pavements in the center of the city are as clean as a museum.
Chang says three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to whipping.
What?!
Imagine.
He was hit ten times with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
Corporal punishment isn't uncommon at all.
How Singapore combines the highest standards of living with the most severe laws, and has been working on the AIF columnist.
No one here is thinking of abolishing the death penalty," says counsel Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long given no regard to the views of both the EU and the US on this matter.
If a person carries large quantities of drugs or sells them, he has a gallows.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi airport, carrying 400 g of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian premiere, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope.
But the guy was hanged anyway.
Since then, drug couriers have been working hard in our country.
The point is that in Singapore, laws are required to comply with all laws in a row, not just the humble and the unrich.
It doesn't matter who you are - a millionaire, a vice-premier, a famous artist or a European citizen.
There's one option here: if you get half a kilo of cocaine, you hang.
When you're walking around Singapore and you meet a bunch of warning signs, you're just a diva-- how many bans there are in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in drugstores, and it can be purchased strictly according to the prescription (!) of a doctor.
No gum will be taken from a tourist when he arrives, but a fine of $1,000 will be imposed on the subway.
In four days, I've met two people with white plates on their necks, "I've been rubbing."
For throwing an urn past, in addition to a fine, they are often sentenced to a "slip to the janitors" — a week of cleaning up parks and beaches.
Six thousand roubles is paid by the "criminal" who forgot to wash the water in the public toilet, and when trying to fix a small need in the elevator of the house, a special detector is activated, the doors are locked and the police are sent a signal.
Exotic laws include the ban on the feeding of pigeons on the street, the public performance of songs, and even excessive watering of the room plant (!): The abundance of water is thought to attract mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers are not allowed to carry lighters on the subway, otherwise they will be fined S$5,000.
Anyway, there's a thought, no matter how hard you try, you're gonna break something.
That's not true at all - trying to disappoint me, Mohammed Kabir-Kajariyah, the owner of the local travel agency.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last 20 years, I haven't seen anyone get involved for violating them.
Why do they keep them?
To keep the citizens from relaxing.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly observed.
Let's say that if a minor is sold in a cigarette stand, everything will be punished along the chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge sum, the offender himself will be beaten with sticks at the back, and the seller will also be whipped and imprisoned.
It is precisely because of such harsh laws that offences are very rare in Singapore.
Is that justified?
As far back as the 1970s, we had chaos on the roads — motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wished, drunken driving.
After a year's fines, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, after having a drink of whiskey, knows that if they stop, the police officer won't let go for a bribe, he'll be fined the price of the apartment and sent to jail for years.
For many foreigners, the city-state in South-East Asia seems to be a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with Death Penalty", a guest from the United States horrified the general wealth of the people, "a scary clean airport" and "cultivated nature".
I mean, these things are unnatural, they look artificial, and they shouldn't be like that.
First days in Singapore, and you're sure afraid to throw a paper on the sidewalk, you'll get caught when you're on the ice cream subway.
But then you come to Little India, and suddenly you're a model breaker, and there's plastic cups at the bus stop.
"What do you mean?" You're surprised.
That's how the Singapurs laugh.
Things happen.
Not every crime like this will be caught on the spot, but you should know that if you're identified, you won't get away with it, because you broke the law.
Most of the time, it's enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, Singapore's power is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Viet Nam's Ho Chi Minh, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often remove smartphones and cameras from tourists' hands.
The center of Paris is full of dirty hobos and beggars.
Not everyone on our streets is trying to throw trash in the urns either.
Singapore, on the other hand, has become the calmest, cleanest and safest city on Earth through the imposition of draconian fines and ruthless laws (up to the death penalty).
You'll think about it.
It's human nature: remember, and no one in Russia was chained to the wheel until they got a fine.
Although Singapore's focus is not on fines, it is on voluntary compliance.
And we should think that people in Russia would also be happy to have clean streets, no garbage on the subway, and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
Corporal punishment, thank you, don't.
Otherwise, Singapore's laws are at least worth looking into.
Nothing holy?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The surest sign of regime change is when he starts fighting statues.
Americans understand this as well as everyone else - from here, the deliberate demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, a key ideologue of the Trump government, knew no doubt what he was doing when he brought a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a violent dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the President's proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try the statue itself.
Pleasure ship owners and artists who represent the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried to do it.
But he tried her meaning, and especially the meaning attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when Emma Lazarus's poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller groaned at Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that shines light on the world.
The poem you're talking about has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller made the facts right, but as he said, it's not really about history.
It's about the current sound of the amazing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, your crowd, who dream of breathing freely, your poor scum."
Never before have "unhappy scum" been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature, he made it clear that Trump wasn't expecting these people in America.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who fought to put her words on the top of the statue after her death - knew very well that they were doing a very political act.
The sculpture was designed to mark the link between the French and American republics by means of a classic classic figure, the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Expelled.
The combination of poems and images was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack against American nativeism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right ones, though they changed it back.
Rush Limbo, a sort of John the Baptist who proclaimed Trump's arrival in 2010, argued that freedom was not inviting anyone, rather she was an early neoconservator carrying America's flame in the darkness of the world: "Liberation is moving forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch isn't to light the way to the US."
Limbo's habit is a real hit here.
The point of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would be seen by exhausted, unhappy, yet hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue answers with the words of hope and hospitality they wish to hear.
And, of course, that's not a prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to accept.
Their torch is not to illuminate the path, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
The 2017 World Cup: Neil Blake highly appreciates the Scottish members of the UK.
Ailid Doyle remembers a time when there were only two Scots on the UK team.
Neil Blake, the director of the UK Light Athlete Federation, stated that a 16-person Scottish team at the World Cup would make a "significant contribution to the team's game".
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected at the 2017 London Championships, starting on Friday.
Blake thinks that in Scotland, "something special" is born, and the UK's Light Athlete Federation should take that into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand and support it as long as they have potential," Blake said.
"I talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish Athlete Federation thinks that what they've done has to be done.
British Athlete's Federation: What they've done has to be done.
And people on the street think the same thing.
I don't know why the circumstances are like this, but it's absolutely brilliant."
Some of the Scottish athletes claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at 5,000 m distance; and Ailid Doyle chose the team as her captain.
"Ailid is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake says.
"A lot of athletes, whether Scots or not, and from where they live or train, come out of this room, feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eilid put into her were wonderful."
The silver medal winner of the Commonwealth Championship, who at her fifth World Championships runs 400 m with obstacles, says that 16 Scottishs on the British team are "unbelievable".
The previous record for the number of Scottishs at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muir, who specializes in mid-distance running and beat five British and two European records last year, is in the lead.
She's gonna run 1,500 feet and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will compete in the 1500 m race, is another Scotsman who deserves attention: behind his back he has had a good season, winning the British team's selections and annual competitions.
Doyle remembers his first world championship when Lee McConnell was the only Scotsman on the team.
The captain of the team says she's "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots not only joined the team, but in some cases will claim medals and fight for finals.
"The captain of the team is chosen by the other team members, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen is a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scottishs who joined the team.
It shows how much we've accomplished.
And they're all the light athletes who're going to try to get to the pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we're gonna be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to get to his arena and compete, and the atmosphere is gonna be great."
Critic blockage on Facebook: You don't have to run for public office unless you're ready to listen to criticism from voters.
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism, of course, annoyed him.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "It is possible to take away the freedom of speech of us, the deaf and the dumb, as sheep to slaughter."
Now I'm going to go to Governor Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and wiped out at least 450 people who spoke on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that.
The governor's subordinates called the suit null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "so what."
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people will say.
But it's important, too.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He's an amazingly popular Republican governor in a democratic state.
He's second in the approval rating among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan's not a stubborn reactionist.
He has shown a strong hand in State governance and commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook wisely as a primary way of communicating with his constituents and jokingly shows his bald head on his page after chemotherapy.
It is therefore unnecessary and ultimately harmful to block people who come to the governor's page - declared as an official public forum and held by the administration on taxpayers' money.
In an interview with Washington Post, press secretary Amelia Ches defended the Governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was just their modification.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers, and haters on the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls -- teachers, businessmen, pastor, who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, informative and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible as appealing that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramán's lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by his lack of reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary section of the Post article.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same subject, some say immediately that it's a so-called twist, instead of admitting that they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What the governor's subordinates call a "concentrated spam attack" is probably what others would call a "active life stance."
In the Facebook era, it is easy to edit your image simply by blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is much less dusty than it used to be when it required sending people, collecting and burning critical front newspapers or arresting and shutting up protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening now, just in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who were lost on his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge from Alexandria, James C. Casheris, the Chairman of the Laudon County Monitoring Board violated First Amendment by booking a voter in her Facebook account.
In Kentucky, Matt Bevin, the Republican Governor, was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's era of affordable postal spending, the Internet has undergone a similar coup.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew four times, and anonymous letters severely undermined his credibility.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the aliases "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belizearius" and "Porzius" wrote letters to newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington Documents online project, his office was flooded with petitions critical of his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very heart of our nation.
And true leadership means agreeing to that.
Ronan Rafferty is hoping for a place to live at Renaissance.
Former European champion, Ronan Rafferty, hopes to have domestic convenience for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for senior athletes.
The Northern Irelander, who was the leader next door at Archerfield Links, was moving towards the final round last year, until he lost to Paul Ils, was attached to the new place, and was a representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarwadi club.
"I've seen Renaissance build, and we've seen him come to a successful conclusion with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this field at its best moment, it's in great condition.
Jerry did a great job setting this place up.
He is a keen supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It's a great demonstration for this field."
The Englishman Ils looks forward to the first chance to stand for the championship, despite winning both the European Challenge Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a really special feeling," said the Southport player.
"I failed to try to win the "Extremada Open" again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Going back to this corner of the world is magical.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
Last year's memories are coming back, and my wife Sharon and I had a very special impression of winning last year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it."
He returned to the battle on his home land, Gary Orr, who joined the European senior athletes tournament after his 50th birthday earlier this year.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberden Associate Management Open.
"When you play at home, it's always a little more important," said the resident of Helensborough Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you feel the extra burden."
I had great pleasure playing again, and I showed you some good golf.
I'm happy with how things work out so far."
On this trio field will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnem and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrans are two of the six Scottishs on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmüir, and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free of charge, and parking costs £5 an hour if there's one person in the car, and £10 if there's two or more people.
All revenues go to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
The various tunnels above the motorways that can absorb carbon monoxide from cars are already being tested on the UK roads.
According to Autocar, the country ' s transport agency reported positive test results for a 100-metre tunnel installed on a highway in the north.
The 6 m high tunnel is built from some advanced polymeric materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the creation of an entire network of such tunnels is only part of the massive measures that the British authorities are about to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the English intend to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic, increase the use of electric commercial transport and upgrade the heavy truck fleet.
According to official statistics, transport accounts for one quarter of all air pollution, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud changed the sentence of the disabled Mamaev to a fine.
Mosgorsud changed the sentence of the disabled Anton Mamaev, who had been sentenced to a fine of 200,000 rubles for four and a half years in the colony.
TASS reports it.
Previously, the Public Prosecutor's Office had asked the court to change the sentence to a conditional one, explaining that Mamaev's disease "destroys his imprisonment".
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment in a general regime colony for robbery against a former Special Forces combatant.
On 19 July, the court released the man from custody at a retreat in SIZO.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's Golden Land
Bardin Degei doesn't use the stove to make dinner.
She doesn't even use the pot anymore.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County, in the rebel Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually simply places sweet potatoes, which is called a note, right in the middle.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor – she doesn't have any furniture – and that's where she does her homework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from nearby marshes.
The bathroom serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She's the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she wasn't assigned to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late may be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk in the village after 5:00 p.m.," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was attached to Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, raising their hands in public before the occupying forces.
The current movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta Government, which maintained strict control over the region by preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, while the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarothali is a city as remote as an abandoned city; the road includes an hour and a half flight from Jayapura, the provincial administrative center, to Nabira, and then a five-hour shaking in a hired car.
There's no public transport here.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, consists of wooden houses with bamboo fences; roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust into a variety of redish shades.
Few Indonesians have arrived, let alone journalists, and almost none of them are foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, papuas worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," Degei says, showing his bright, hand-picked turban, dark skirt, and bright shirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, 28% of its population lives below the poverty line, and infant mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold land.
The largest gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, located in Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced approximately $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can boast of its 78 billion dollars worth of forest reserves.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for the papois, guaranteeing that the powerful Indonesian armed forces maintain their suffocating presence here.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local troops and units nearly $20 million, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the papois threaten the existence of this gold mine and are ruthlessly repressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 papuas have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, massacres in indigenous highlands in Papua in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose everything," a report published in 2016 by Brisbane diocese contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture – especially frequent, as claimed in another report, rape and electric shocks – and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, who is researching Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Guyks have been protracted as Papua ' s resources have attracted an influx of displaced persons from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million inhabitants are 83% Christian, but demographic indicators change with the arrival of Muslim economic migrants from densely populated Indonesian islands – Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Javan shops, "warungs", sell fried chicken and a mixture of gado-gado vegetables served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to resist the competition.
"Migrates started selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the natives of Papua," explains Abet Yo, a 20-year-old Paniai who moved to Jayapura, the capital of the province, because of her work.
"This has led to the loss of market opportunities for the indigenous people of Papua – mother-mother (women) in Papua."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokovi, vowed to address inequality and rights violations in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, a former carpenter obtained support from 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But there has been little change in Papua, and locals feel loyal.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jocky in 2014, expecting him to fulfil our hopes for justice," says Yo.
In fact, just two months after Jokovi Paniai's inauguration in October, he suffered a tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing their Christmas anthems at the Enarotal fire when two Indonesian soldiers broke out of the dark on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Javette Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and returned with four soldiers some time later.
According to victims and witnesses, soldiers who were drunk pursued children and beat them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, a 16-year-old Julianus Eimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to the nearby government building of the election commission, and the next day, the situation worsened.
About a thousand papois men, women and children gathered in the football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them the ritual hunting onions and performed the whit, the dance of the papois tribe of Mee Pago, running in circles and playing bird singing.
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police station and the military base.
When the situation got tense, the soldiers were given an internal radio order, "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," so it sounded, according to an official document that TIME reporters saw, but which was not published in the local media.
Jeremias Kayama, a 50-year-old head of Koto Koto district in Anarotali, felt threatened and called for calm by asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned around, I suddenly had a bullet in my left wrist," he told the magazine "TIME", standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from outside the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there were many shots," he added.
A local resident of Alfius Iowa was hit three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, says.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said tiME magazine Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only uses one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Yotje Mende, Senior Inspector of Papua Police, told the reporters that his officers were only "defending" their base because she was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," stated Commissioner Pujo Sulistillo of Papua Police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the murders didn't reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapur in which he expressed condolences to the victims' families and vowed to address the historical abuse of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Viranto, said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately the excuses came out.
"A large part of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some occurred in the nineties or at the beginning of the zeros.
The point is, we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures to be followed," he said.
Viranto then retracted his words, speaking with the magazine "TIME" on June 5, in Jakarta, and said that he did not plan to establish a complaints organization in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It's gonna be decided through a court of law."
Viranto, who had been accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people during the bloody vote for East Timor's independence in 1999, said that 11 human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai met such statements with a grim mistrust.
"I've been questioned four times in the last three years, but there has been no change at all," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid I'm gonna get arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'm gonna get shot."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the view that the people of Panama were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten up by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came after me," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in the district of Deiyay neighbouring Paniai.
During the clash between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help take a man unconscious to hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
A 20-year-old man, Ravianus Dove, drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested to the company's construction site office.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the officers who responded with warning shots.
But the locals claim that the mobile team (the Indonesian Special Forces) started shooting at the crowd and killed one man.
"We were in such panic, we are afraid of retaliation," reported the magazine "TIME" to the twenty-nine-year-old Dominggu Badia, who lives near the hospital and saw how quickly the wounded were delivered.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyay Parliament demanded that the officers involved be called to account and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Paniai has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is a cause of discontent among my tribe, the Moni, the dani and the dysal, scattered throughout the green-covered central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Movement for Free Papua (OPR), an rebel army that claims to defend the rights of papois by engaging in sporadic attacks and kidnapping attacks on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military under the pretext of "protection of national independence" in Paniai in recent years.
Some never came back.
Among the people of Papua Paniai, it is considered "a sad, forgotten place".
Poverty exacerbates frustration.
A small portion of the rice sold in Anarotali is too expensive for the locals.
The bread is equally inaccessible.
People here grow everything they eat, mostly a note, as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually save most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten tubers cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities have increased between indigenous papoises and new migrants who have arrived in large numbers since the introduction of new flights to Nabira airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually offered to better educated and wealthy migrants.
The papois rarely have enough money or skills to run their own competitive business.
"You young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no work or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Paniai tribal council.
The isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escuudi and Basil Longshan were deported from Papua for "undercoherence with relevant organizations" despite being given rare permission to film.
According to Felim Keen, Asia's Deputy Director, Human Rights Watch, the promises made during Jokowi's election campaign to lift media restrictions in order to promote transparency and development were not fulfilled.
"The foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, are now facing new dangers: denial of visas and blacklisting," he said in the statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including shooting at Paniai.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arramanath Nassir, turned away from the group's statement, informing journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of episodes of human rights violations".
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Netherlands Ambassador for Human Rights, Kiys Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local residents broke the silence by praying, "We want freedom", according to the source, who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will be held in 2019, but the papois say they're unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokovi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that, apart from living in the shadow of a threat from the greedy army, the people of Paniai are living in poverty, and their education and health care are in poor condition.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like the other papois, consider their vote for Jokowi to be a debt that he must pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on the ground directly opposite the police station and the military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never be served, at least they won't let the guilty forget their crimes.
"We killed a member of our family," says Jacobus, without raising his head.
"What else were we gonna do?"
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper "Fakel"
The fire hit one of the world's highest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to leave the 70-story-storey structure of 337 metres [337 m] of turf.
This is the second fire that hit the high-rise building, which by coincidence is called "Fakel", in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported and no operational news was available on the cause of the fire.
"We slept and woke up from fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said Reuters to a skyscraper resident called George.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Authority, the fire brigades put out a fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide asylum to victims.
The incident could put on the agenda the safety of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the Fakel administration after the fire in 2015 revealed that the most affected were crying, the external panels used for presentation and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, police stated that they believed that the isolation system and the crying panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could have accelerated the spread of the fire that had occurred there in June, killing some 80 people.
The increase in tourist flows to Ida-Virumaa in June proved to be minimal
According to data received from the Statistics Department, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, 125 or 0.6 per cent more than in the same period the previous year, had benefited from the services of the North-East hotel industry in June 2017, according to the reporter of the Rus.err.ee portal.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has decreased and the number of foreign tourists has increased.
In June, for example, the flow of foreign tourists increased by 7.3 per cent (544) to 7,994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The largest increase in the number of Russian tourists in the region was by 8.9 per cent, or 318 per cent, compared with June 2016.
In June 2017, 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed at Ida-Viruma Hotels.
Andrei Malakhov made it clear to his fans who were responsible for his departure.
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his fans at Instagram who were responsible for his departure from Channel One.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors, but today he posted a piece of an article in the newspaper Vedomis on August 1st.
The picture of Malakhov signed the tag "boss of milk."
Article on how to prevent the "burning" of an employee and to pay attention to his condition.
When you recall the many reports that the host was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who had begun to reformulate "Let talk", it became clear what he had so clearly hinted at, writing "KP".
It was reported that the television director, Andrei Malakhov, was currently on leave and had not signed an application for dismissal from Channel One.
The situation regarding dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
Five military personnel were killed in the car explosion in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers died in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, transmitting RIA News.
According to the police, a car bomb exploded the previous night near the military checkpoint in Girishk county.
20 dead are known.
There was a new emergency in Girishka on Friday morning.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver videod the shark that bit his camera.
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal captured a video of a shark that bit his GoPro action camera.
The film was posted on Facebook by a unit of the United States Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, whose staff is Scomal.
The incident took place on 2 August off the Cape Code peninsula in the north-east of the United States, explaining the Necn portal.
The man tried to take the shark off the camera he was holding on a special stick during the diving.
When a man was spotted, an animal more than three metres long came to him.
The shark started biting the camera without trying to attack the scientist.
Scomal explained that the predator had done the same to determine whether the viper was eaten.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also observed that the marine animal's behavior was new to scientists.
The cause of the mass fight at the Ural military center is known.
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military Region arrived at the Elan Training Centre, where a mass fight took place, to investigate the incident.
Some details of the beating have already been made known.
According to Mash's pamphlet on the VKontakte page, the Ural military unit 3, 1612's contractors had a violent fight over an unspoiled bed.
It started out that a private named Sayan had defiantly ignored an officer's order to fill the lying sheet.
The officer was sided by soldiers from Company Six.
Sayana supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young men were knocked down in a bed and sink barracks, knocked out glasses.
More than 10 people were injured in a mass fight.
The CSS denied the information about the stabbing.
The study found that at least one fifth of the passengers in the United States carry prohibited objects into a plane.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried prohibited items on board aircraft through the United States Transportation Security Administration inspection points, including a minimum of 6 per cent of whom boarded the aircraft with prohibited knives or other sharp objects on sight.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., and reaching over 1,000 people, also revealed that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to fly with something that ATB was forbidden, 19.7 per cent were millilenials, compared to less than 15 per cent of Generation X members.
Prudently, the ART staff are most often served with food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they had deliberately carried sharp objects through the search, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted that they had knowingly transported prohibited drugs into the plane.
The company stated that it had studied passengers all over the country to see how many of them had accidentally smuggled through airport searches and how many had knowingly done so.
It is quite expected that most often, consciously or unconsciously, those who fly most often drag smuggling through the search.
According to the company, the ATB's rules are rather complicated and complicated.
People often don't know exactly what liquids they can carry and how much.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what the ATB selects are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that the ATB might be banned from carrying a book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
EPA chapter Pruitt rejects the intention to postpone the Obama emission reduction regulations
The day after the claim by the 15 states, the Head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to postpone the Obama regulations to reduce air-polluting and smog emissions.
Pruitt explained his decision because his agency was now more responsive than in previous administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He did not mention a lawsuit against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute took place around the deadline of 1 October for states to meet the 2015 ozone-level standards at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone compliance for one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "disadvantages to local solutions or obstacles to economic growth".
Pruitt, who was the Attorney-General of Oklahoma before he was appointed President Trump to his current position, was long known as a consistent opponent of environmental standards.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of regulations that have been opposed by the chemical or gas oil industry.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of Pewitt's course of return to the old standards.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of EPA had exceeded his authority by trying to delay the Obama administration's regulation requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakages.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, after changing the course on ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the obligation of EPA to cooperate with states in the integrated process of timely implementation of the new standards.
"The previous EPA administrations often failed to meet the deadline, then waited for claims from groups of activists and others, and discussed deadlines during the settlement of the case," said Pruitt, who had filed more than a dozen lawsuits against EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in the regulation of trials, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We are also serious about our statutes and the authority that they give us."
However, EPA's application states that Pruitt may at some point again use his "delay powers and other statutory powers" to make sure that the rules of "jcyjdfys are on a clear course and on all available information".
Republicans in Congress insist on a broader revision of the ozone rules.
The bill approved by the House of Representatives last month seeks to delay compliance with the 2015 regulations by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on the matter.
The New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against EPA this week, said that the group intended to continue with legal pressure.
"The change in the course of the EPA – after our lawsuits – is an important victory in the struggle for health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans, who have been directly affected by the attack on their cities," said Schneiderman.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C., joined the New York lawsuit.
Ozone at the ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, refineries and chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
This could cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health and environment advocates welcomed the unexpected change in Pruitt's course.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from the man who is responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Bird of the Biodiversity Center.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and protect those who cause air pollution and their special interests."
Congress IAAF extended the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athlete
The Congress of the International Association of Athlete Federations (IAAF) voted in favour of the extension of the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athlete (WFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF Rehabilitation Council, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension be maintained.
A total of 166 people voted in favour of the extension of the suspension, 21 against the suspension, handed over to TASS.
The IAF Board report stated that WFLA had made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the re-election board, but that those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the VFLA at the London World Cup, Russian athletes were forced to perform under the neutral flag.
The team was made up of 19 members of the IAAF team.
WFLA was permanently disqualified by IAF in 2015.
At that time, the report of the independent expert of the World Antidoping Agency (WADA), Dick Pound, was published, highlighting numerous violations of WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the Board's latest report, read the IAAF's "IAF has extended the sanctions against the VFLA".
A Disgusting Defeat
As part of Russia's 3 rounds of Phonbeth first, Newoskovsky's "Chimik" played a field match against the Kaluga FC.
A little over 10 days ago, rivals played among themselves in Russia's Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"Chemical" did not give way to the opponent, but a second of relaxing at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After a recent defeat by the Clausians with an account of 0:3, many pre-empted the easy victory of the masters.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the Novoskovs made themselves count and acted from a position of defence, but from a position of force.
In the first half of the year, the kaluzhans were built up more and had the advantage of owning the ball.
Another very high-quality match was held by Alexey Sirotin, who repeatedly reflected the dangerous blows and gave the partners confidence in his actions.
Unfortunately, the chemical attack lacked the effort and the luck to bust the Kaluga defense and score the first goal at the exit.
After the break, the game began to take place in counter-courses.
The New Yorkers played more actively in the attack.
The alarming calls to our team were defence errors, which allowed the Clausians to create a series of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the chemical meeting, he intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the Clausian experience played its part -- they conducted the ending in a more intelligent and cold-blooded manner, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, "Chemic" moved the ball to a corner, the pitching of which was moved to the gate without resistance by the owners of the field.
Yuri Dubrovin was the author of the goal.
In the reporting meeting, "Chemic" demonstrated a good game, but suffered a disgruntled defeat.
In the lead, our team is waiting for another trip, on 11 August at 7 p.m. in Moscow at the Torpedo Stadium of Edward Streltsov the Newoskovs will fight the favourite of the FK Centre "Ararat", which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexey Rebko.
Come and support "Chemical!"
The venue and time of the meeting of the Newoskovs is 18:30 outside the Magnolia store (East, D.2, Corp.
Composition of "Chemica": Sirotin, Manohin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Homutov, Gogya (Oreshkin), Dudaity, Ryzhov, Saints, Beljanin (Adoevtsev), Andreichenko (Lygin)
The Press Service of the Chemical Club
According to published phone decrypts, Trump was pressuring Mexico about paying the border wall.
The Washington Post published telephone decrypts between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, in a telephone conversation with the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The U.S. president scolded him for publicly speaking against the wall, and according to leaked information, he said, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump started his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore he'd make Mexico pay for the project.
His first telephone conversation with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia was also deciphered in a hot altercation.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the U.S. should receive refugees heading for Australia was "funny", "negative" and "stupid", and insisted that because of the agreement concluded by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot because he intended to stop moving refugees to the U.S.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant conversation of all day."
The bodies of the victims in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Petersburg
The aircraft belonging to the Russian airline, carrying the bodies of Russian women killed in Abkhazia, flew from Sochi time to St. Petersburg at 20:15 p.m. and left Moscow at 20.15 p.m.
The site of the final destination will be met by members of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the City Hall, and told journalists by the Deputy Minister for Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia, Astamir Ahba.
Previously, representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic stated that the Government of Abkhazia had borne all the costs involved in bringing the bodies back to Russia.
In addition, the official Sukhumi intends to compensate the families of the victims in the amount of 500,000 roubles.
According to Ahba, the Abkhaz leadership had expressed its willingness to pay the families of the victims of the bombings to travel and reside in the Republic, but the relatives had only sent to the Republic the power of attorney to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On 2 August, at approximately 4:20 p.m. Moscow time, two explosions occurred at the Ministry of Defence ' s missile-artillery weapons depot in the village of the Primorsk Hudaut district, followed by the detonation of large-calibre shells and other ammunition stored there.
As a result, the warehouse was set on fire and caused uncontrolled projectile explosions of various modifications.
Two Russian citizens, Elena Poliakov, born in 1970 and Elena Timothyev, born in 1962, died as a result of an ER.
Sixty-four persons, including 35 Russian Federation citizens and 29 Abkhaz citizens, were taken to the Republic ' s medical institutions with varying degrees of severity.
There are currently seven people in the hospital, the rest of whom are discharged.
A large jury will study the Russian influence on American elections.
The Special Prosecutor for Russia, Robert Müller, has called a large jury in Washington, D.C., who will study Russia's influence on the presidential election in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to examine witnesses under oath.
The material collected will examine the Special Prosecutor ' s Office and decide whether it is sufficient to bring charges.
The convening of a grand jury gives Müller additional authority to collect evidence.
One of the topics of the jury investigation that began a few weeks ago will be the details of the son's meeting then with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnica, President Donald Trump's candidate.
Müller promised to check the details of the June 2016 meeting.
They've already been investigated by the FBI.
At the end of July, Donald Trump, Jr., was reported to have increased the number of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. had previously said that he had been waiting for a compromise at the headquarters of the Hillary Clinton Democratic candidate from his meeting with Veselnica, but no disclosure documents had been submitted, and the result was adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr. ' s statement of meeting with Veselnica was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House made it clear that the president didn't dictate anything, but simply used his authority to do what any father would do.
Vice Mayor Penza was detained in the workplace.
The deputy head of the Penza administration, Irin Shirshin, was detained for 48 hours at the request of the Investigation Committee at her workplace, reporting to RIA News.
No official reports have yet been received from law enforcement agencies on this matter, but the UK Press Service has assured them that they will soon follow.
There's no comment on what happened at Penza Town Hall yet.
Irina Shirshin is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has been in charge of urban issues and land relations since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as head of the Department of State Construction Inspection in the Penzena Region.
Irina Shirshina is raising three minor children, and it is noteworthy that once again she became a mother a year ago, she refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, Mexico does not have a launch vehicle or a launch vehicle.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bust is a tribute to the first person in space.
Unlike the Soviet monuments that are being demolished in some countries, Gagarin's monuments are, on the contrary, "walking around the planet".
In 2012, the monument was installed in American Houston near NASA's former headquarters.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was installed in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first space flight.
There's a Gagarin monument in Germany in Erfoot, where our astronaut was in 1963.
The memorial in Karlov Wars (Cehia) escaped demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city centre to a square in front of the local airport.
During the 70th anniversary of Gagarin in Riga, a monument to Yurius Gagarins appeared.
That's what the first astronaut's name sounds like in Latvian, and he looks like he's 70 years old.
Morse Ford's murder: activists will lose Lynch's courts on stage to call for justice.
"Ford Mercury" of 1948 passed the audience in the village of Monroe, Georgia, and racing towards the small bridge of Morse Ford.
When the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its way.
The leader, a middle-aged man wearing a thin stripe, took a cigar and looked through the windshield.
Sitting inside was shivering with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" a man buzzed.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screaming screams ripped the silence when a young black man was dragged out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this awful scene, which was played on July 22, is just a stage.
But when Roger's neck was covered with a noose, most of the audience actually held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to lose again that night, when two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and May Murray Dorsey, were lynching in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that no one has been arrested in all these years - although we see them with us; although we know who they are -" says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a rock on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Congress of Georgia who has been fighting for human rights all his life.
To him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to Monroe residents that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want an investigation, we want an end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
"We cannot move on to healing and reconciliation until justice is done."
The coroner covers the body of one of the lynching victims at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records received by Al-B.C. News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of involvement in lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
While the suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights defenders say that in the city, two bound motives of vigilante are always well known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling for the first time allowed black citizens to vote for the primer, which was due to take place that summer.
In about the same election, according to the FBI, a black user, Roger Malcolm, stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, in the fight, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that, according to rumors that hester was sleeping with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the baby she was supposed to have wasn't from her husband.
According to FBI reports, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a major white landowner, paid $600 bail to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of prison and drove to Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison's murder was organized and commanded," this is the conclusion of an FBI report.
"It is also clear that there was collusion between state and city law enforcement agencies, which not only took part in the murders, but also destroyed the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt on electoral rights," he says.
"They were all killed to send a signal to the blacks in the city: if you register and vote, the same will happen to you."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Green has been running an annual play replicating that lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her play is visible, he captures the audience and talks about the profound racism that many would like to believe is no longer in America.
It's hard to see and even harder to turn away, but Green thinks that's what matters.
"We don't want to talk about the Lynch courts because they show us our own uglyness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals of this year's play began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of them black - gathered in the room and listened to a year-long review of the play.
Wade Marbo was the director with Green.
He has played the role of chief member of the clan for several years, but he says the role has never been easier.
"I think I'm dirty because it's not the person I am," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at that time."
In the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, are repeating their roles.
Spectal starts with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said nigga, get out of my house!"
Screams Rascon back.
It's a blow.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) laugh.
Green laughs louder than anyone.
"What's the matter," Asks Ascon.
He's concerned and embarrassed.
Am I overplaying?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think the whites said 'nigga' at the time."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ye
"You're gonna have to pass the hard 'r'."
And the energy in the room is also changing: the discomfort is changing from a sense of partnership.
Everyone has to do the right thing, not just for the play, but for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene starts over.
This time, when Rascona says the "n" word, it gets clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends cruelly and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the actors' bodies and sings the sad song of Billy Holiday "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted through the word.
A hundred yards from it, half a hundred viewers wipe their tears and sweat out of their eyes.
There are almost equal numbers of blacks and whites among the audience.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York to see the show; many live very close.
They had all endured Georgia's heavy perfume for almost eight hours while Brooks took them to a pilgrimage to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Until then, the murders remained only a story, but now that they're standing in the same place where people were lynching, it seems that their ghosts are in the air.
When the last note of the song slows down, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Kids bend over to their heads, touch blood paint and still bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mutters, as if to remind himself of it.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly it's over.
Actors drop ropes off their necks and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main doll-clan.
Nick Rascona hugs two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the play finally hit him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had a reason for that."
Later, the audience sits down for dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta has a lively discussion with the black couple they just met.
Denise Daplinski has difficulty finding words to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to listen to those horrible, creepy words, and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think lynchings are still happening," she adds, "only now it's called what the police are shooting."
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks took a big interest in him, who remembers his work as a human rights defender.
He says he's already started planning next year's show.
"The play inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we've been through, but also teaches us," he says.
'Cause if you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
The court fined naval for violations on "agitation Saturday"
The Simon Court of Moscow fined Alexey Naval 300,000 rubles for disrupting the organization of the rally.
The opposition was found guilty of an administrative offence provided for in article 20.2, paragraph 8, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, "Return violation of the procedure for organizing a meeting".
Previously, Judge Hyzir Mussakaev of the Simon Court of Moscow had completed the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of staff of oppositionist Alexey Nowal, who had been prosecuted under the same article as Naval.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev assessed the distribution of leaflets on the "agitation Saturday" that the Naval supporters had conducted in Moscow on 8 and 9 July.
After seeing the campaign materials, the police officers who followed the participants on Saturday felt that the organizers of the event had deliberately concealed its true nature by public action (for which permission must be sought in advance from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers, Ivan Jdanov and Alexander Pomazuev, requested that the administrative proceedings should be discontinued because of the absence of the elements of the offence and indicated that the police had made some mistakes in the drafting of the report.
Volkov was not detained on the "agitation Saturday" itself, but he received a summons requiring him to report to the police station to report on an event he had actively participated in.
The same subpoenas were received by the Naval and another opponent, Nikolai Laskin.
In Mordova, the bride who shot and three wedding guests were arrested.
The court in Mordova arrested a local man who shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported to the Republican Office of the Investigation Committee.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 July.
During the fight, a 42-year-old citizen of Saranska shot at the guests of the event, who came to the village pond to bathe.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), of the Criminal Code (Huliganism), article 30, paragraph 3, and article 105, paragraph 2 (a), (e), (a) and (b) of the Criminal Code (attempted murder of two or more persons committed in a generally dangerous manner for hooligan motives).
According to Interfax, the local media reported that the man had opened fire because the wedding guests had decided to bathe in the area of his precinct to the watershed.
Minergo will increase requirements for turbine suppliers for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines, HPP turbines, oil pumping facilities and oil production facilities are launched, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share access data with Minenergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft Government Regulation has already been prepared and submitted for public consultation.
The new requirements will concern only "critically important energy equipment" supplied to Russia.
The potential threats identified in the document include obtaining information and access to the management of the facility by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and entities, abusive partners and hackers.
The EU expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
On 4 August, the European Union press service stated that the anti-Russian sanctions had been extended due to a scandal surrounding the supply of Siemens production turbines in Crimea.
This was previously reported by the "Arguments of the Week".
The EU Council Press Service stated that the sanctions against the Russian Federation had been extended due to the Siemens scandal, which allegedly had been taken to Crimea, bypassing the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
Previously, it had been reported that a final decision would be taken before the end of the day, and the decision had been taken, and the sanctions against Russia had been extended.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life.
On Friday, the British Pearson Education Group announced that it would cut 3,000 more jobs and reduce the amount of the provisional dividend by 72 per cent as a result of the start of another restructuring programme aimed at addressing the challenges facing their businesses.
These job cuts, which, according to John Fallon's head, will mostly take place at the end of 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut down during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it was planning to cut spending by an additional £300 million ($394 million) in May during the third cost-cutting programme to try to bring back to life a business that had been hit by a rapid transition to digital learning.
The company that agreed last month to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said that its projections for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 per cent increase in sales of the main product in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: Nato soldier killed in a suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, as stated in NATO ' s report.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the city of Karabakh.
This explosion is the last of the massacres that struck Afghanistan this month: on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion on Thursday evening occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by a "human-borne improvised explosive device".
All the wounded are reported to be in stable condition and to receive treatment at the American military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Respondents report that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed nearby in Bagram.
According to United Nations reports, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, and about 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bombing in a car caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed they attacked.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed in a massive explosion in the city centre, the most serious human-related terrorist attack in the country since United States-led troops suspended the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence highlights the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is assessing whether there is a need to increase the number of U.S. military forces assisting the country's troops and police.
According to correspondents, the attacks in Kabul over the past weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency, following court actions, has reversed the decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed the decision to postpone the Obama-era law that states should limit air pollution emissions one day after 15 states sued the agency because of that move.
On the evening of Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called ozone measurements 2015, stressing that this step demonstrated the agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with and responsiveness to our state partners," said the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency ' s intention to postpone ozone measurements, in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter air purity standards for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, filed a lawsuit with the Federal District of Colombia alleging that the intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to reverse the wide range of environmental regulations introduced by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader programme aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has generated resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency's website states that the use of ozone-containing air for breathing "can worsen the function of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
The European Business Association opposed new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and employment.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, so free trade cannot be restricted.
The European business comprises more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of State and Government of the EU, the US and Russia to work out a new course of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and harmony.
The deputies ask the police to restrict traffic on the waterfront in Pskov.
The Pskov People ' s Electors addressed a message to the UMAD Head of the City of Sergei Surine regarding the problem of movement along the Great River.
The deputies of the proud Constantin Bolotin, Grigory of the Party and Valerius Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, driver control would help to make the area safer and safer.
The problem is that violators ignore the signs of the footpath and travel freely along the coast.
It appears that major repairs and improvements have been for nothing.
Sports and children's playgrounds become uncomfortable with cars.
As noted by the Pskov Information Agency, the central riverside patrol is conducted in the evenings by members of the PPP mobile patrol and by friends.
As a result, the number of passing vehicles is becoming smaller, but the traffic is not completely cut off.
Putin asked the investigating authorities not to remove the hard drives.
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed that investigative authorities should be prohibited from removing servers and hard drives from work computers in businesses.
The Head of State said that at the meeting on investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, there is a need to "delete the application for investigation of measures leading to the suspension of business activities, including the removal of hard disks from work computers and servers".
Putin noted that if investigators had such a need, "it is sufficient to remove copies, assure them and use them in the course of the investigation".
The Head of State added that it was not possible "to create conditions preventing the continuation of the business until tax cannot be paid".

British actor Robert Hardy died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played Cornelius Faj's magic minister in the filming of the Harry Potter series, died in '92.
This was reported by the Independent on Thursday.

Something rotted in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean Andre, Count de Laborde, refused to be buried with his venomous wife, Queen Margaret.
Four of us have a golden wedding this year, but the couple's agenda isn't about preparing for the celebrations, it's about a tempting argument.
His Highness gave up the title of Prince Consort, and he told the Queen that she had never claimed the title of King Consort.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains the official wife of the Queen.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on Washington to stop molesting Moscow.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to Mike Pens' remarks accusing Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Balkans.
The foreign policy agency circulated the statement some time ago.
In its comments, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that the United States was increasingly using cold war stamps that were inadequate to present-day realities.
In addition, Russian diplomats have called on the United States authorities to stop molesting the Russian Federation.
According to "Arguments of the Week" the previous day, US Vice-President Mike Pence accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing a failed coup d'état in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko are meeting for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive fight.
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to be steadily moving towards the most exciting boxing match of up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of ESPN in Los Angeles until Garcia, an undefeated World Boxing Council champion, walked down the corridor to greet Lomachenko, World Boxing Organization champion in the second halfweight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over the world's former four-weight champion, Erian Broner, on Saturday's Showtime, both boxers enter the top five, regardless of the weight categories.
Garcia reached out to his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Climas, noticed that a potential decisive fight between them would be perfect.
"I used to be half-weighted," Garcia reminded me.
"I'm in the category for Broner [up to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm not enough for 140.
I want to go down to the middle of nowhere.
And he's gonna have to get up to half easy, and then we're gonna have a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's make it happen to them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Box needs this fight."
Climas asked if the fight should be broadcast through PPV as part of the strategy he is pursuing for Lomachenko to carry out his 135-weight debut later this year to set up a meeting next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), which is also interested in fighting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their battle for the World Lightweight Championship in the Forum on 23 September.
"The fight may be at PPV because all the fans asked for it," said Garcia, expressing later his willingness to fight on the channel that would offer the best financial terms.
"We are the main names.
No other name would be of such interest.
As soon as they're ready..."
Garcia said he thought Lomachenko was an amazing boxer and might visit his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately compliment Garcia and said that he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... you were knocked out.
Garcia said he was focusing on showing the force of impact and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension rising in front of their own fight.
"This fight must take place.
No other battle is so exciting and interesting.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for one of the top-down boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
This is gonna be a great fight."

New results of tests for assessing the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden have been published
Recent tests of asylum-seekers in Sweden, who had been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of age, showed that more than 80 per cent of those tested had been assessed as over 18 years of age, but not all trusted the accuracy of those results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicalverket) began testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the assessment of age in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationverket) was criticized for not being able to determine the real age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
So far, Migrationverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of the testees were assessed as 18 years or older, and in another 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency estimated that the tester was "probably 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that a person was "probably under 18".
Tests are conducted only when the age of the person is in doubt.
According to Johan Gueranson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with those of the past months.
"We don't see much difference with the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate," he said to The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people had been assessed as 18 years of age did not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers had lied about their age.
In May, the agency released 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases "probably the age of the test is 18 years or more".
However, after examining 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that 243 people had openly declared that they were 18 years old.
The method of conducting a medical assessment of age, consisting of an X-ray of wisdom teeth and a C.T. of knee joints for examination to dentists and X-rays, has also been criticized in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Carolyn Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to determine whether they have passed through puberty before or after normal maturity.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think we should use the measurement methods that are being used now.
The biological age is thus very inaccurate.
If we can't identify him with certainty, we shouldn't pretend we can," he said to Metro.
Heranssen, however, of the Forensic Medicine Agency, argued in favour of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, the risk of mistaking a child for an adult is small.
We face the greatest risk when a person is about 18, in which case he is about 10 per cent."
I'll see if I can run for president.
On a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was willing to think whether to run for President of Russia in the 2018 elections, he would hand over the Interfax.
This statement was a response to a request from the village of Cheremskki of Buryat province.
During the videoconference on the elimination of the fire in Buryatiya and Irkutsk region, the interviewee addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimír Vladimirović, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election comes, we all ask you to run again for the post."
"Okay, I'll think about it, thank you," said the president.
On 28 July, Russian President Dmitry Peskov's press secretary commented on some media reports that Vladimir Putin's electoral headquarters would be headed by President Anton Weino, Chief Executive Officer of the Russian Federation.
Peskov called these assumptions "nothing based on hypothetical reasoning."
"As long as there's no headquarters, there's no headquarters, there's no headquarters, there's no campaign," said Peskov.
"Until it's on the agenda," said Peskov.
The Governor of West Virginia stated that he was moving to another party
The Governor of West Virginia, Democratic Party representative Jim Justis, announced on Thursday at a rally with President Trump, which is moving to another party.
"Would you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me," said Governor Justis.
"Today I speak to you with many prayers and many reflections... today I tell you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of use to you as a Democratic Governor."
Mything blew up with applause.
"So tomorrow I'm gonna change my registration to a Republican," Justis added.
"As a coach, I would tell you that time is different to play."
Trump previously promised that an important statement would be made at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia at 42 percent, and Justis did not support the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justis, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited the coal business from his father.
His condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night that "the transfer of Governor Justis to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is preventing rather than working to make our country great again".
"In view of the 15 governors and the control over the smallest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justis's statement is just another rejection of a party that has no leadership from the top to the bottom and is unable to find positive, unifying messages," reported the CBS News representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronna McDaniel.
Mr. Beauty found a house thanks to social media.
Pittsborough, North Carolina, U.S.A., built a cat named Mr. Beauty, weighing more than 14 kilos after he became famous thanks to the Internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a photo of a cat asking to find its owner was posted on a home account on Facebook because "someone had been feeding it before".
In the comments, users noted that the expression of an animal's face could become a new meme.
The publication received more than 3.2 thousand likes and 15,000 comments.
In their comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to take Mr. Beauty into their care.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to do overweight.
In an interview with WNCN, an American woman said that she had already had this experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilos, and now it weighs just over five pounds.
In July, Reddit's users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long legs.
An animal photo post collected more than 68,000 views.
Commentators noted that she might well have made a career in modeling.
Coe praised Russia's "honest" apology for the doping scandal.
International athletics expert Sebastian Coe praised on Thursday what he called Russia's sincere apologies for the doping scandal, but reiterated that this is not the time to allow the country to participate again in sports competitions.
The Russian representative of the Athlete Federation, Dmitry Schlakhtin, reported at the congress of the International Association of Athlete Federations, which took place the day before the World Athletics Championships, that the removal of his country from sports competition was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all athletes whose gold and silver medals were stolen from the competitions".
Despite his comments, Congress of the International Association of Athlete Federations voted in favour of retaining the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of publicly funded doping.
"It seemed to me that today's answer, today's report was very sincere," said the president of the International Association of Athlete Federations Coe.
"All the council and the entire congress loved... that the Russian Federation itself acknowledged that it had been through extremely hot times and was now doing everything in its power to take care of the restructuring of the federation."
Coe said that he also "liked" that Russia had accepted the criteria for its recovery.
"I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that this is not the time to restore Russia's rights," said Coe.
"In the next few months, we must do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from a stained system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athlete Federations will participate under the neutral flag in the World Athlete Championships, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athlete Federations, Rune Andersen, stated on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met in order to rebuild Russia.
As he told reporters in London after a presentation on the Board of the International Association of Athlete Federations, drug testing is still not done in sufficient quantities, and the suspended coaches are still doing their work in peace.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason.
A journalist, Vasily Muravitzki, detained by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU), was sent to be arrested for two months and handed over to the SBU.
A member of the Jitomira Journal online is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and violating Ukraine's territorial integrity.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against a journalist, considering this to be a "warrior policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to undertake a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
The patrol ship Commandante Borcini entered Libya's territorial waters in order to stop the influx of illegal migrants, together with the Navy of that country.
The decision to launch the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome has agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which does not, however, control most of the country ' s territory.
The opposing Cabinet and the Libyan Parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of violating Libya ' s sovereignty.
And the Commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they did not believe these threats and intended to send another warship to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in negotiations between Italian premier Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the Europeanly recognized Libyan Cabinet, Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities had established a maritime mission to combat illegal migration following the publication in July of statistics on the number of illegal arrivals from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that the resources to receive migrants had been exhausted.
Large-scale malfunction occurred in Skype
The global disruption of the Skype service has now been observed in several countries around the world.
On Thursday, 3 August, users began to send mass complaints to programme developers.
Microsoft stressed that specialists are already actively working to address the problems faced by the people of Europe and North America, explaining RIA News.
In June of this year, Skype's work also failed.
Users could not receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of the Ukrainian Light Athlete Team were suspended from participating in the FM
Olga Earthk and Olesia Povh, specializing in the short run, are excluded from Ukraine's World Championship 2017 in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Athletes of the Country (FLAU).
This decision was taken by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings by the International Association of Athlete Federations (IAAF) against lightly athletes.
Coach Earthk Sergei Basenko is also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, IAF suspects athlete to use doping.
Poach is the bronze winner of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Cup, the 2010 European champion of the 4-100-metre relay, and the 2012 European winner of the 4-400-metre relay.
The World Athlete Championships in London will take place from August 4 to August 13.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neimar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs would not interfere with the world record of Neimar's transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Pari Saint-Germain.
Any consequences could follow the chain, for Pari Saint-Germain of UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, in whose authority the teams are prohibited from participating in the prestigious League of Champions tournament.
The financial "fireplay" rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 show that PFP will eventually have to show that Neimar's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to free a Brazilian from the contract, and Neimar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neimar's move to France.
The PSC could certainly pay off to hire Neimar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFP introduced Michelle Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
A former French football player believed that clubs that were heavily indebted in their quest for success were, in fact, cheated and risked ruin if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on the debts of clubs and moved instead to track their losses.
As a result of this change in the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential, and then to spend a lot of money to improve the team and create a world brand – has become a difficult plan.
During the current three-year evaluation period, which covers 2018, clubs may suffer losses of Euro30 million.
And despite the disgraceful removal of Platini from his presidential post in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive spending.
"It's gonna be possible that FFP is alive, and we're gonna push the rules forward," said Andrea Traverso's Associated Press agency, which controls FFP at UEFA last week.
Although PSC will pay a one-time buyout to Neimar's contract, it can report this amount over the entire duration of his contract.
Neimar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual report as an expense of Euro44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were imposed on FFP as well as on Abu Dhabi's Manchester City.
PWP was fined Euro60 million (at a rate of $82 million), which was later reduced to Euro20 million, and was ordered to limit its team in the Champion League during the 2014–1015 season to 21 players instead of the regular 25.
UEFA tracks clubs that may try to outsmart its financial inspections by poking up their revenues at the expense of companies linked to the owners of the club.
Although a Qatari company could sponsor PSC, if the amount of funding was considered to be above standard market prices, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legal income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that the funding of the PFP from Qatar's Tourism Authority had been raised.
It has been reported that part of Neimar's earnings to PSC could have come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSC and Qatar 2022 deny that Neimar will be the ambassador to the World Cup, and such a manipulation could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on PSC mean that UEFA will be even more careful to monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, persons familiar with the situation reported that UEFA did not engage in preliminary discussions with PFP about the Neimar transfer.
They spoke to Associated Press on anonymous terms, as they were not allowed to discuss the position of PSC.
According to the most recent report published, in 2015-1016, PSC received more than 10 million euros in revenue, with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have not yet been published.
PSC expects that the arrival of Neimar will be a favourable ground for sponsorship transactions, the sale of attributes, and team logo T-shirts.
At the club, turnover is expected to grow by at least 30 percent as a result of hiring a new player.
Unquestionably angry with the departure of one of the best football players, the Spanish league tried to prevent Neimar's transfer, claiming that PRS would violate the financial "fireplay".
"This is an obvious case of "financial doping," with the club and the state," said the Spanish newspaper "AS", President La League Javier Tebas, with the intention that Qatar is the ultimate owner of the "PCW".
Arsenala coach Arsenala, Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La League's doubts about the funding of the club by the state.
"It's all the consequences of sharing, and it's completely changed the football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It is becoming very difficult to follow a financial fireplay because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The President will determine the manner and place of the oath.
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation, the President will determine such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law have been drawn up by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State-building.
A week ago, the deputies were planning to directly determine the procedure for swearing in the law.
Children up to 18 years of age, as well as those who are incompetent, will be exempted from the solemn oath, as follows from the amended text of the draft law "On Russian citizenship" (available in the Gazette), which the committee will consider before its second reading at its meeting on 11 July.
On 6 June, in a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of taking an oath to become a citizen of the Russian Federation instead of formally signing documents.
The deputies formulated this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the draft law, which provides for the annulment of the decision to grant citizenship to those who have subsequently been convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist offences: for example, for public incitement to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (art. 205.2, para. 2, of the Criminal Code), as well as for the hijacking of aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is linked to terrorism (art. 211, para. 4 of the Criminal Code).
According to the draft law, his logic was: by issuing citizenship documents, a person signed up to a promise to comply with Russian law - to set himself on the path of extremism - he violated that promise.
In April, the leaders of the Doum's factions, Vladimir Vasiliev (one Russia), Gennady Zyganov (KPRF), Vladimir Girinowski (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (just Russia), and the Speaker of DG Vyacheslav Volodin, submitted a bill to the State.
On 19 May, the deputies accepted it on first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Building and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but it has now been revised.
It now states that the President of the Russian Federation will establish the procedure for taking the oath.
Previously, parliamentarians had intended to describe the procedure directly in the Law on Citizenship of the Russian Federation, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the State crest and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the draft law where such an event was to take place - a list of places where the country ' s coat of arms could be located - was regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, heads of State, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive, etc.
Most likely, it could be a registry.
A solemn oath will be made by those wishing to acquire Russian citizenship after the officials have checked their documents.
But the Russian passport of a person will only be obtained after he has sworn in the final text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should be preceded by the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn in from the age of 18, not from the age of 14.
A rule has been maintained whereby the oaths will be discharged from those who are incapable or of limited capacity, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the oath themselves.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and "other persons",
The updated bill also sets out a special procedure for the admission of Ukrainian citizens who are considered to be Russian speakers.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting an application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will have to be handed over to Russian officials.
Waiver of "other" nationality, as it is now, will not be required if this is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible "for reasons beyond the control of the person".
An amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the First Vice Speaker of DG Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krascheninnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all of whom are "One Russia").
I think a lot of you know it's impossible to get a certificate from Ukraine, just impossible.
Accordingly, a great number of people are awaiting a decision on their fate regarding the citizenship of the Russian Federation, explained the previous day to Pavel Krascheninnikov, head of the Duma Committee on State Building and Legislation.
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on the employment of certain posts for foreigners would not apply to those who had renounced "other" citizenship in writing and had handed over their previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but that "for reasons beyond its control", he had not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited from holding municipal posts, from being employed in facilities and organizations whose activities are related to Russia ' s security.
Also, a person with a dual nationality or residence permit from another country cannot become a member of the State Duma or a member of the Council of the Federation.
It is planned that the law will enter into force on 1 September 2017, by which time the necessary by-laws will have to be in place.
Nostalgia is becoming a niche in "The Hot American Summer" and "The Comrade of Detectives."
The present iteration of the story is nostalgicly reminiscent of both the glorious days of the characters in the 1980s; the age of grunge in the 1990s (about the time when outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Schwalter made the sketche of the State for MTV); and themselves - that is, the year 2001, before her stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Paul and Paul Ruddd, turned to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is both the rise and the implementation of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, she seems anachronism.
The first day of the camp was surprisingly good, not only because of absurd humor (including the original story of H. John Benjamin's talking vegetable can).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have only just reached the age of majority; thus the inability to return to the joke becomes part of the joke.
"Ten years later, where adults have already played adults, has less emotional roots, and its parody is more unsystematic and includes riffs from the Stalker films of the 1990s, such as "Rooks Rolling the cradle".
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheel roller skates, and "a bunch of other things from 1991.
Lots of plotting moves are the same.
Good-natured Coop (Showalter), now a writer, has not yet achieved reciprocity from Katie (Margerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't broken up with virginity.
And then there's this crazy and sneaky conspiracy that Ronald Reagan (also Shawalter) is involved in, which is now being provoked by George Bush the Sr. (the tested parody of Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the retreat from it.
It's particularly funny to see a always young Rudd who sings Matt Dillon's song from Lonely, whose character, a former big man Andy, now looks old.
This franchise could have been successful with random insanity like the recursive series "Seven Up" until it reaches what I think would have been its logical conclusion: "A hot American summer: 20 years later", where in the last scene, the whole company would have gone to the movies for the premiere of the film "A hot American summer".
The Comrade Detective in the Amazon is turning to another type of nostalgia: the memories of the cold war from the Americans, the explosive blonde, or even the Blossom with its images of East-West struggle.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Riz Thomas, depicts a television film: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninian route.
The main roles - Gregor and the idealist Joseph - were played by Florine Pierresik Jr. and Cornelia Uchik, and their dialogues in English, Channing Tatum (he is also the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon Levit.
That's a brilliant idea.
But just an idea.
There are some visual jokes (the police spend time watching a game of chess, how Americans could watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the frame -- among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevinya -- makes it interesting to play "guess the voice."
But the Comrade Detective is holding onto the truth of clumsy propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask -- which often looks like her.
Six long episodes are long, and it's funny not very often.
If it were made shorter, "Comrade Detective" could better handle its agitpropa satira; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph came to the American embassy, there were two fat people in the lobby, eating a bunch of hamburgers.
This image tells an imaginary Communist viewer that Western culture can make fat out of anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The Russian Super Bowl basketball fund between Spartacus and Locomotive is about 30 million rubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Prime League (RPFL), Sergei Purkin, at a press conference.
According to the head of EMPL, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, reporting to RT.
He also added that there were almost no tickets to the match to date.
The Spartacus-Lokomotiv match will take place on Friday, 14 July, at 9:30.
According to TASS, Spartacus is the Russian champion-in-chief and Locomotive is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young Oofims cleaned the furniture shop for 200,000 rubles.
The other day, a 37-year-old UP who had a furniture firm approached the police.
The man claimed to have stolen expensive tools from the shop, causing serious damage to his production.
The prey of thieves has become instruments worth almost 200,000 rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulics, and a winch.
The guards began to search for the perpetrators and soon came to the inhabitants of the Bashkortostan region, friends of 23 and 24 years of age.
According to the press services of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the accomplices entered the premises of the company, broke into the front door and took out the instruments.
Right after that, the guys sold the stolen machinery to the first car service they got.
They had already been prosecuted for theft, and law enforcement officers had been able to return only part of the stolen instruments to the legitimate owner.
The State Department commented on what he said about the relationship between the Russian Federation and the United States.
The US and Russia should be able to work with each other.
Such a statement was made by the official representative of the State Department, Heather Nowert, in response to the remarks by the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitrimedev, on the relations between the two States.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government stated that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the US had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nowert acknowledged that Russian-American relations were at a "low level", but noted that "areas for interaction" should be sought.
"Look at the truce in southwest Syria, which has been in place for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," quoted the diplomat RIA News.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the Russian Prime Minister ' s statement that sanctions were tantamount to a trade war.
The new sanctions bill against Russia, Iran, and the DPRK was signed by US President Donald Trump on the previous Wednesday.
He acknowledged, however, that the document had failed and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "grew" roses from amethysts and quartz
The French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - is a jewellery unit that has been added to the Rose Dior Bagatele and Bois de Rose collections.
They have five new rings and three velvet band necklaces.
The Rose Dior Pre Catelan line produced two new amethyst rings and necklaces, pink quartz and diamonds, performed in gliptics (man-made stone thread) and pavagia, dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoire de Castellan was inspired by the roses that he had grown in his estate in Granville, the modeler Christian Dior, and the Paris gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found the perpetrators of the deterioration of relations with Russia
President Donald Trump of the United States made a sharp criticism of the members of the Congress.
In the view of the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, the same people can't even give us medicine," wrote the president on Twitter.
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and the DPRK.
In particular, Russian banks and energy companies will be affected.
Subsequently, the White House issued a presidential statement in which it stated that the law would prevent the US from entering into profitable deals and would bring Russia, China, and North Korea closer together.
The Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank.
The Belarusian entrepreneur Victor Prokopeny withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBA) for purchase of Sberbank ' s subsidiary unit.
The decision of the businessman explained to RBC the intention "to concentrate on other of our planned investments and projects we are working on".
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a move would be "the best investment of time," despite the investment attraction of buying Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenja became the main applicant for purchase of a unit of the Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of NorvikBank Consortium Grigoriya Güselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Guzeriyev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the President of the country, Peter Poroshenko, imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One such financial organization, besides the VTB and the Vnesheconombank, was Sberbank.
Novak called the reason for the blackout in Crimea.
At the Russian Ministry of Energy, they named the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Nowak, made a statement explaining what had happened.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to an accident in the territory of Krasnodar province.
The truck hit the transmission lines, shutting down the Cuban and associated Crimean networks.
The power outages of the major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The experts corrected the problems within a few hours.
It was initially reported that the blackout could have been caused by an abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have made rumours of a possible increase clear.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain slow, leaving interest rates unchanged among the growing pressures on family incomes.
The members of the Bank ' s Monetary Policy Committee (MCC) voted with 6 against 2 in favour of maintaining a rate of 0.25 per cent, with a smaller number of members this month advocating an increase in the rate because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly report on inflation, the bank limited its projections to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, and warned that the pressure on family income would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in the fall.
However, the bank warned that higher rates in the next few years would be needed to control brace inflation, and stated that borrowing costs would probably have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
The members of the committee also voted in favour of abandoning part of the huge economic development package launched a year ago as a result of the bracet.
Starting next February, the bank will close the emergency financing plan, under which it provides low-cost loans to banks, although it has reported that it is now to provide an additional Pound15 billion – up to Pound115 billion – under the plan.
In the decision-making protocol, the bank said, "According to the MPC's main projections, gross domestic product (GDP) growth remains slow in the near future, while pressures on real household income continue to affect consumption."
On the question of rates, he reiterated that the suspension of inflation would require "some tightening of financial policy" in a "slightly larger" size than markets expected.
Today, markets predict the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be "phased" and "limited".
Bank projections for this and next year are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank kept its forecast at 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After the news, the sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent disappointing growth rate weakened the increase; GDP then rose by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the bank's representative, growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest report on inflation gave little cause for joy to households, which were hit by high inflation and very small wage increases: the bank said that pressure would increase before it fell.
The Bank added that financial policy "can't prevent" profit-making in the next few years, but expects that wages "significantly" will be restored by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also driven by growing demand for British products, which is driven by a low pound, which offsets part of the reduced consumer spending.
The decision was made one year after last August, the rates were reduced to 0.25 per cent after the shocking results of the EU withdrawal referendum, which led to the fall of the pound.
The bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last decision on the rates, there was an increase in the noise surrounding the anticipated rate increase, as inflation was increasingly pushing already under pressure on the already heavily under-exposed households: three experts on the committee requested an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6 per cent last month, from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that the fall was expected and compensated again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate than the planned 2 per cent was entirely the result of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent fall in swaps, it seems that the mortgage market will become even more competitive again, as creditors require business opportunities and expect a good end of the year.
The market is particularly favourable for those approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing of loans, often with the possibility of a commission being absent and with a low rate of interest, is becoming more popular than ever."
The public health service will issue a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a "revolutionary" HIV-prevention drug after the battle at the High Court to finance the drug from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposure HIV prevention (PREP), a pre-sex pill that has been proven to reduce the risk of infection in persons at risk by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the Health Service for an initial three-year probation period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld last year's High Court ruling, which stated that the National Health Service had an opportunity to pay for the PRE despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
This move, announced on Thursday, was called "the most important innovation" by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it "a turning point".
Prior to the full launch of the program throughout England by April 2018, the veneer dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and more will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PREP) is a pre-sex course for HIV drugs to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Research has shown that PEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When you take a PREP before you have sex in your body, there's enough drugs to prevent you from contracting HIV.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-positive and who do not receive successful treatment.
Dispersors will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and people whose partners are unknown, whether their HIV status is contained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereal clinic participating in the program.
The program will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England signed a drug deal this week after an international tender.
The study is designed to assess the full potential of PREP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its yield and its use on a large scale.
"This critical innovation should complement and reinforce the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the greatest threats to human health.
The President of NAT (National AIDS Control Agency) stated: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PEP, if well targeted to people in need and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk of HIV will be able to access a new tool, which is being developed by the National Health Service in England, and which can be controlled by a person without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news."
Jan Greene, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The first thing to do is to make sure that the test is done quickly across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is forgotten.
Now that we've been provided with an experimental PEC drug, we're going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV."
Shadow Minister of People's Health Sharon Hodgson said, "We very much welcome the beginning of the PEC test, it's very late because of months of delays and delays on the part of the government."
Data show how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and halting the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PEP.
It is now important that the test be deployed as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people at risk of HIV and to move us a step further towards halting the spread of HIV in society.
The Tatar World Congress adopted a resolution on support for the Treaty between Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the Tatar World Congress (WCC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of retaining the presidency in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "an established form of organization of the highest State authority in the Republic and expresses the national interests of the entire Tatar people".
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the delimitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "has played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole".
Once again, since 24 July 2007, a treaty between Moscow and Kazanja has been concluded for 10 years.
On 11 July, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and to retain the title of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only federal entity that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "President".
In Russia, difficulties arose in obtaining international driving permits.
HYDD units lack international driving permits (IDPs).
In order to obtain such rights, it takes several weeks to wait in line, which has become a real problem for vacationers wishing to take a vacation abroad in their own car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with regard to international driving permits remains contradictory.
The IDP has been introduced to make it easier for foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, since the information is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are set out in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized.
In fact, however, it depends on specific police or rental offices: some require IDPs and others have sufficient national rights.
In order to protect themselves, drivers still receive international rights, but it is worth bearing in mind that in countries that have not ratified the Convention (e.g. the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or IDPs.
There is now a problem with the forms in almost all units of GIDD, reports Commersant, conducting a study in a number of regions.
In Moscow, for example, the OIGED units simply do not issue stamps, and the forms have been missing for four months.
You can make an appointment on the public services website, but it's already extended until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, IDPs cannot be obtained "for technical reasons" without going into detail, but in the Samara region it is honestly said that there are no forms similar to the situation in other cities.
Many Moscows have already faced the problem, and social media are increasingly reporting:
Irina Burmistrov: "Guess why international rights can't be obtained in Moscow."
That's right, 'cause all the HYDD's offices are out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "The Question to Knowers!"
We need to get international rights very urgently.
In Moscow, it's always a long way ahead, and they don't even give tickets at all. (The button is eating, but the ticket can't give.)
I think the public service portal shows that Spb has a lot of free time.
Did anyone try to get it in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the requirements for the forms of international driving permits have changed, so new forms are being delivered to the units of the State Motor Inspectorate.
This may be due to a deficit, but it is not clear what changes are in question, but it has not been reported previously.
The Blanki procures the Special Purpose Centre for Road Safety (STDS) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and then supplies them to the units of the GIBDD.
In recent years, all contracts have been awarded to the Goznak AO: nearly 200,000 IDP forms were produced in 2014-2015, 15,000 were purchased in 2016 and 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract was concluded on 18 July with the First Printing Court OS for the production of 70,000 forms.
There's a theory that the CSN just didn't get in time for the tender, which is why there's been a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people have started travelling on their own, not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand, and so on.
It is not clear what rights are taken there, and that is why people are being re-insured, and that is why the demand for international "scarces" has become so glamorous.
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to pass the certification test.
The proposal was made by the Mintrans.
The new international driving permit (IDP) has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Ukrainian Minister of Justice refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
Ukrainian Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko stated that he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said that in an interview with the Monitor.
No self-respecting international company would even put a bolt or a barrel in it because it risked losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan, in countries that had joined sanctions against Russia against Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, there is virtually no prospect for this project," Petrenko said.
He added that Russia considered that it was unable to carry out a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller objects as well.
I know that after the Sochi Olympics, whole stadiums started to collapse.
"I therefore believe that the best instrument in this situation - sanctions against companies that proved to be short-sighted enough to join this project -" the official noted.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kerchen Bank, a major assembly of the Crimean Bridge ' s road arch has been completed: it is closed at a height of 45 metres from the base of the structure.
"One time bridge builders prepared a rail arch for installation on the fairway pillars", said the project's information centre.
In April, the head of Mintrans, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the site was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Ridge.
In Spain, an official who hadn't gone to work for 10 years had been fired.
What kind of patience (or total indifference to public service) should the head of Spanish official Carles Recio have?
The permanent walk lasted 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was still dismissed.
But not his direct superior.
The only thing that doesn't happen in the bureaucrats world.
The commoners seem to be used to all the naughty people.
And yet, officials are always able to surprise those whose taxes they live well.
This time, "sensation" came from Spain.
There, a staff member of Valencia Carles Recio's archives managed to stay away from work for ten years.
He received regular salaries.
All the solids are 50,000 euros a year.
Mr. Recio's "funny times" are over.
He was fired by a decision of the Valencian Legislative Assembly.
The investigation revealed that a hard-on walker came to the office every working morning at 0700 hours to check in with the electronic system.
And then he went home.
Once again, he appeared at the workplace at 4 p.m. to report back to the system that he had left.
It's been 10 years.
It was also reported that the skipper spent all his free time drawing comic books at home.
The members of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia are now thinking about how to punish Mr. Recio's immediate superior, who could not have failed to know how to "actively work" his subordinate in his workplace.
Judges are asked to protect themselves from presidents.
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (CHR), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes that the powers of the presidents of the courts be limited and that their election be established.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the Human Rights Council wishes to introduce special districts that will not be attached to the administrative and territorial branch of the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit proposals in the context of the presidential commission.
The HRC has finalized proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the HRC on behalf of Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, which was given by the President after a meeting with the members of the Council.
At a meeting with members of the Council on 8 December 2016, some cases of judicial arbitrariness were discussed, as well as the problems of public control in places of detention (see JO of 9 December).
The outcome of the HRC ' s work was 25 proposals, both concerning the independence of the judiciary and the detection of miscarriages of justice, as well as the financing of the courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presiding officers of the courts in order to enhance the independence of the remaining judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge has successfully passed the competition and has received the support of the judicial community, the President of the Court, in the opinion of the HRC, should present him for appointment without the right to refuse, as the law now permits.
It is also proposed that the President be denied the right to allocate cases to judges.
This is something that experts allow to do, a specially written computer program can do.
The HRC also considers that the President is not entitled to "predict the judge's qualifications, initiate disciplinary action against him or her, and decide on additional material payments".
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to "the election of the Presidents of the Courts by the judges themselves" and "to give them powers for a relatively short period of time, with mandatory rotation".
All presidents of the courts (from republican to district) are now appointed by the President for a period of six years, on the proposal of the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressure from the regional administrations, the HRC proposes to re-organize appeals and cassation in the ordinary courts.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC states that "it is necessary to ensure that individual courts of appeal and cassation are organized not at the level of the regional judicial bodies in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts".
Experts take as a basis the practice of arbitral tribunals.
They have "judicial districts" that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but which thus guarantee greater independence from regional officials, who are hampered by the use of "telephone law".
HRC justices of the peace propose that the people's jurors be strengthened to deal with certain "civil and administrative cases" with their participation.
For example, deprivation of parental rights, reinstatement, protection of honour and dignity, deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"It's just our proposals," explained the JO member of the HRC, a judge of the Constitutional Court retired Tamar Morshakov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate applied not only to the HRC but also to the Supreme Court (SC), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the Armed Forces to carry out the task (the co-perpetrators are the Gender Procurator and the Human Rights Commissioner in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin on the effectiveness of the Russian Federation ' s independence of justice, the Chairman of the Armed Forces of Vyacheslav Lebedev is due before 1 September.
Living a tall life: semi-elegance and clever designers turned this little apartment in Earl's Court into a spacious home.
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, moved from a spacious house in Nightsbridge to an apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a nice, modeled Anna-style house, and the new design says that Joan didn't pack her things and move again.
"I used to live with my ex in Nightsbridge in a much larger area," Joan says.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earl's Court, and there were just as high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered a price on the same day."
Since the first review, a 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Initially, it was an apartment with one bedroom of complex planning – to get into the bedroom, it had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add space to store things and semi-estate to squeeze the maximum benefit from the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands," she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill architectural design studio "Duck & Shed" to use the 12.5-foot ceiling and create a housing that would not only be a successful project but would be good for Joan.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two rooms one above the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-estate where one could stand at full growth.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the briff.
"The work with steel structures is very complicated," he explains.
"We had to set up rooms so that they could be placed above each other, and we didn't have to bend.
It was not just necessary to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they were at the right height and allow the use of the spaces from above and from below."
This decision allowed Erfan to have two full-sized rooms one above the other in the space to be occupied – and a lot more interesting.
From the semi-ethage through the vintage copper light window of "Retrouvius", a view of the gorgeous living room below is opened.
Mirror furniture with gold trim, silver accents, and vintage lighting devices from Serge Mui are setting up the design style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding sight, spaciousness, and light.
The short corridor is covered with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror panel looks like a window to another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinets serve to store all of Joan's dishes.
In order to create a sense of greater luxury, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the emerging kitchens.
The unique thing about this kitchen is that it's a moving door upstairs, like in a garage.
"The art of engineering was involved here," Ehrfan tells us about a reinforced steel wood-fibre shield door.
"It's equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily."
Thanks to the prudent use of space and storage areas, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom, and an improved layout.
"In the end, the floor area is exactly what you're going to sell, that is, what your real estate is valued on," says Erfan.
"Breakingly speaking, the real estate agent will come in and make calculations based on the floor area."
Here, they were able to increase the floor area by using quality materials that gave luxury space.
"The materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection to the house," says Erfan.
"No one falls in love with the wiring in the walls.
It is important, but it does not touch the strings of our hearts."
It's a sign that, at the expense of a good design and an enlarged meter, an apartment can turn from something normal to something amazing.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a cultural policy commission
The Russian Government has approved the establishment of a commission on State cultural policy.
The relevant decree has been published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to formulate and adjust strategic approaches to cultural policy implementation.
The Commission will also draft a cultural policy strategy, clarify tasks and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The head of the Commission has been appointed Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, approved in 2016 a plan for the implementation of the State cultural policy strategy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 measures and measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and will contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries decreased to eight years minimum
The rise in consumer prices in G20 countries has fallen to the lowest in eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal with reference to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
OECD estimates that inflation in June 2016 was 2 per cent - lower in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7 per cent.
Rosstat previously reported a 0.1 per cent decline in the consumer price index in Russia.
The agency thus recorded the first week of deflation in 2017.
The inflation rate in Russia is estimated by the Ministry of Finance at 4.1 per cent.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target has already been achieved, according to the agency ' s version, at 4 per cent.
Putin warned against the illegal removal of the Baikal Taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned at a meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baykal territory against the illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donsk, noted that a bill had been drafted earlier.
It allows logging during fire disposal, and the Government plans to accept it as early as the fall.
In turn, the President stated that the project should be monitored to ensure that the cut-off process "didn't knock everything out."
Donsk noted that the draft law involved monitoring by the MES and the supervisory agencies.
Media: U.S.A. fighters, in secret from command, negotiate with the Donbas militia
There is a regular telephone service in the Donbass armed confrontation line.
Fighters of the warring parties are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known at headquarters.
The U.S.S.A. and Donbas militia have established cellphone communication in secret from their high command.
On 4 August, Stern.ua reported this with reference to members of the military operation in Donbas.
According to the publication, unit commanders are well aware of the names of their counterparts on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on a daily basis.
Communication is not at all common: commanders are trying to reach some kind of "tactical agreement."
The results of these conversations often lead to a truce on a particular front.
Journalists have learned of cases in which an officer received congratulations on his birthday from behind the front line, from his official enemy.
The U.S.A. and the DNR and LND militia have been sitting in the trenches on the line of distinction since spring 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against Donbas.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was outraged by the blocking of United Nations Security Forces reports of attacks on the Russian Embassy
In the Russian foreign policy department, they are outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives, who block statements by the United Nations Sovbeca in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The agency recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on 2 August was the third time in a month that a mortar shell had been fired by the terrorists of the Heyat Tahrir Al-Sham groups (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, prohibited in the Russian Federation) and Failak Al-Rahman.
Bearing in mind that the international community is unanimous in the qualification of Nusra as a terrorist organization and the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council call for opposition to this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation stated that "it would seem self-evident that the attacks of Nusrah must be condemned by all without conditions and with determination, and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions".
However, as the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council have stressed in the literature, "for the third time in a month, they have blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft statement to the press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital, as they have been tossed into the tone of objections".
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the conscience of those delegations.
"The most disturbing thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to engage in further provocations and acts of terrorism, gives them a sense of impunity," said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and added that "it would not be desirable for these barbarians to have the impression that someone in the Security Council is working with them."
Vladimir Putin advocated limiting the number of exceptional business audits
Russian President Vladimir Putin, during the investment project meeting in the Far East, stated that the number of unplanned inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the number planned, and that the time limit for inspections should be limited to 10 days.
"Unscheduled inspections are generally carried out without appropriate coordination with the Public Prosecutor's Office; only 2-3 per cent are coordinated with the Public Prosecutor's Office; the rest is done on its own", quoted the President of TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should not be allowed to seize servers and hard drives in businesses.
In addition, in the President ' s view, business associations should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"It is hoped that this will give some positive consideration to business-related cases or to violations of the law in the area of business," said the Head of State.
As reported by JO, the moratorium on scheduled inspections is increasing the number of other types of business inspections.
In May, at the request of the Russian President Boris Titov, a business ombudsman was asked to conduct a survey that revealed that there had actually been a replacement of routine checks with non-scheduled ones (the proportion of those who had encountered them had risen from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016, prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), raiders (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), as well as checks on citizens ' applications (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
More details about the background checks on the JO's Small Business came from the other side.
The brothers are fighting for a real estate empire worth more than $500 million.
Two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former director of Carlton's football club and developer Colin de Lutes live in Turak Palace three doors from his younger brother Paul, who sued him in the Supreme Court for the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still in a violent dispute about divorce.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since their family bought a shop on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family's property list includes office buildings today, building sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Golden Bank and Mount Buller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
In agreement with Colin's late father, whom Paul describes as "the main driving force and dominant person" of the De Lutes family, he owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one third.
According to the court, Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's 176 million.
The division of property and money has become a stumbling block for Paul.
"The division offered by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful reconciliation attempts, the first hearings of the Supreme Court were held.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - from which Paul believes Colin has ruled it out.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of certain objects.
In Colin's testimony at the beginning of the trial, he says he looks forward to a resolution of the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider my family a top priority," he wrote.
Court costs are rising as a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Kramer have been added to the case; both parties have engaged the best-known lawyers, including King's Counsel Allan Meyers, and the best cooks.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late wife Luigi were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they had run dairy bars and gastronoms, and in the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last grade of school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, were hoping to transfer their possessions to their sons without conflict.
"Louigi often told me he didn't want his brothers to go to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis' group of companies; Colina says that Mark got 10 million when he left the business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "displeased with the financial conditions of their office".
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL board of directors and, according to Eddie McGir's 2015 biography, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, a text message stating that, since the case had not yet been tried, "I really have nothing to say".
"I'm very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and talk in court about our family's name," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin testified that he was trying to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want to see Paul and I arguing in court," he said, adding that "we still hope to resolve the conflict."
Friday, that hope seems to have been dispelled.
"Our case will soon be decided by a court of law," said Colin.
The new head of Trump's office is planning to limit the flow of information to the President.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
Then he'll be the first.
Politicalo reports that the new head of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the Chief calm.
That's what reporter Josh Dawsey says.
"At a meeting held by the new Chief of the White House, John F. Kelly, with the management of the apparatus on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: bad channels of information to the President."
Kelly told the staff that the information had to go through it -- paper or briefings -- because the president would be better off making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is completely correct, but others have already failed in their attempt to subdue Trump by tracking the flow of information to him.
President Trump's relationship with television began decades ago - and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, resented the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he had received fair coverage in publications that could have been re-converted," said Sam Nanberg, a former adviser to the electoral staff in February.
Tara Palmery then wrote in "Policio" that "in the words of six former electoral staff members, in order to control Trump's habit of tweeting, it was necessary to make sure that the information received in person contained a constant stream of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's habit of tweeting has ever been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe these election staff members know something we don't know -- for example, if it weren't for them, Trump's tweet would have been even more provocative.
We may never find out about the tweets Trump hasn't published.
If his staff kept him out of trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has ever been able to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to push their subpoena by giving Trump material - reliable or not - that confirms their views.
"Politico"--this is exactly the story-- wrote in May about the counselor's tendency to constantly give the president questionable information.
Here's an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"The current and former Trump employees say Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone printed out an article from GotNews.com to the president, Charles C. Johnson's Internet proprietor's website, where Katie Welsch's deputy chief of staff was accused of being behind the leaks in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson's been forever booked on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he hasn't presented specific facts, or that in the past he's launched false accusations and then abandoned them.
Trump read the article and started asking staff about Welch."
Goldmacher adds that then Chief of Staff Rains Pribus and Secretary of the Rob Porter machine "tryed to build a system to manage and document the flow of the paper that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has impulsive nature, and his associates are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
The Tumen Prosecutor ' s Office is fighting an HIV dissident.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the decision of the Kalinin Ra ' isud Tümeni, who had dropped the criminal case against a local woman whose daughter had died of HIV.
As a result, the child is said to have died because the mother is an HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court relieved her of her responsibility for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished without setting a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a woman resident of Tümena was brought under article 109, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (causing death by negligence) in April, after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV did not exist," explained in the Prosecutor's Office of the Tumen Region.
The criminal case was brought to Kalininsk Raisud Tümeni, who decided on 25 July to discontinue it.
The father of the girl who died made a request to do so, explaining that "he has asked his wife, has no claims against her, has made amends and has apologized".
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office did not agree with the court ' s decision and appealed, demanding that the decision to dismiss the case be reversed and referred to a new hearing.
The girl died, and it's impossible to make amends for the crime.
The HIV-positive mother refused to examine the baby and treat her with a dangerous infection, as recommended by the doctors," reported to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In the view of the oversight body, she should be punished, otherwise her example would be followed by other HIV-dissidents.
According to the Tumen AIDS Centre, there are now about 12 HIV-positive children in Tumen province who are not receiving medical care because of their parents' refusal.
"This situation has already improved - during the year of the work of the special group, half of the parents who have categorically refused to treat children for HIV, changed their minds - allowed for diagnosis, started taking medications," said Elena Losewa, spokesperson of the AIDS Centre.
According to her, it was impossible to influence parents by law and not all HIV-positive children could be identified - mothers were not allowed to examine them, were hiding, and were running away with children from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV dissidents?
At the end of last year, Peterburg social scientists presented the results of Russia's first study of the so-called HIV dissident movement.
HIV dissidents are called people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Health professionals and AIDS service activists in the NPOs call such views anti-medical, and they see their dissemination as a serious threat.
The terrible photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the Grechana railway station in Hmelnitsky.
A hilarious company of drunk young people walked the bridge over the railway tracks, where a freight train was just standing.
One of the friends had the idea of making a glamorous selfie on the roof of the car, and they told FACTAM in the police communications sector in Khmelnitsky province.
The guy started coming down from the bridge to the train, but due to his lack of care, he hooked up to the power line and immediately got electrocuted.
Fortunately, this case was reported to the station's dispatcher, who immediately called the emergency room.
Prior to the arrival of the doctors, the victim was transferred to a safe location and then hospitalized in the burning section of the Khmelnitsky Regional Clinical Hospital.
The male was diagnosed with torso burns from 1 to 2 degrees.
His condition is now assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcement officials recall that, recently, extreme selfies on the rooftops of multi-purposes, bridges, and transportation are becoming increasingly popular.
The police call on people to be vigilant and to avoid such photographs, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the oceans to exist on ancient Venus
On ancient Venus, there could have been oceans.
French scientists made this suggestion.
The experts created a computer model that demonstrated the formation of water on the planet's surface, writing Science News.
It turns out that at the beginning of Venus' history, there were oceans with 10% more water in them than they are now on Earth.
Previously, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that, according to the theory of scientists, the ocean could have existed on Mars four billion years ago.
Foreign experts concluded in their research that the water object was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured in the San Francisco park shooting
In San Francisco, three people were injured as a result of the shooting, passing on the Associated Press.
The incident took place in Dolores Park, where a large number of visitors were present.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge started shouting threats.
One of them grabbed a gun and started shooting people.
The appearance of the perpetrators could not be seen because they had everything but eyes closed.
Another was treated and released.
The third victim is a minor, no details of his condition.
Dolores Park, located on the hill, is a popular place for local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured in a night club shooting in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured trying to leave the premises.
The Luna rock band will present a new album in Barnaul.
The Luna rock band's concert will take place in Barnaul on 17 October.
The musicians will present their new album, "The New World of Beautiful", which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The group is preparing a conceptual show that will be the most vivid in the band's concert history.
"A Beautiful New World" is the fourth album by Russian rock band Louna.
His name is related to the famous O. Huxley novel "O Amazing New World."
New songs don't tell the book, but talk about a society that lives by the law of antitopia, "blinding its faith in propaganda and imposed values."
The band was helped to raise money for the album: more than 1,200 people supported the project on Planet.ru.
Luna released her first album, "Make Thunder!" in 2010.
Two years later, musicians presented the album "Time X", and in 2013, they recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the autumn of 2015, Luna performed a symphony orchestra at the Crocus City Hall with a program called "Songs of Peace".
In the group Lusine Gevorkian (vocal), Vitaly Demidenko (bas guitar), Ruben Kazarian (guitar), Sergei Ponkratiev (guitar), and Leonid Kinsbourski (drums).
The concert will take place at the Barnaul Club Faraon on 17 October at 7 p.m.
Price of tickets: 1,200 to 2,600 roubles.
Louna is one of the groups on the Russian rock scene.
The collection was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The band has won a number of awards in the bloody Dozen's hit parade several times.
The Gypsies crossed the moat and returned to the "millionaire street"
Some of West Midland ' s richest homeowners are again in conflict with the determined Roma who have overcome the moat dug by the municipal authorities in order to re-enter the field near their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihalla Street, which is known as "millionaire Street" in a funny way.
When they brought their horses, babies, and many houses on wheels, they returned after they had been kicked out just in May, and they were not prevented by a moat dug up by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactful company found a rift in the defensive structures and squeezed its vehicles through a section that was left unguarded to leave room for the path.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solikhall, saying that he was "unable to solve the problem".
An anonymous local woman said, "They came here Monday night after they were chased out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by."
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act because they are completely incapable of solving the problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were kicked out, and now they're back.
More gypsies arrived last night, and perhaps even more today.
"The city of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like that I keep paying the municipal tax, and the municipality can't even put an end to it."
A local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said, "It's funny, we just saw these gypsies leaving the previous time, and here we go.
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse on the meadow."
The representative of the municipality of Solichalla stated: "We know about the illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and we are cooperating with the Solihall police; we are taking the necessary legal action to get them out as soon as possible."
To help us gather evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police on phone 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea is sanctioned by the Champagne Wine Plant of the New World.
The Crimea State Department of the Republic of Crimea, the "New Light Champagne Wine Plant", has decided to authorize the transformation into the "New Light Champagne Wine Plant" of the UAO, as ordered by the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anyuhin.
100% of the shares of the enterprise will remain in the State of Crimea.
The fixed capital of the joint-stock company will be 595.5 million roubles and will consist of 5.955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 roubles each.
The Crimea Ministry of Agriculture has stated that if funds are not available for the renovation of the plant within the next three years, the plant will be at risk of being shut down.
The cost of the plant's fixed assets is between 60 and 70 per cent.
It requires 1.2 billion rubles for the modernization of the enterprise and is required to pay 50 per cent of the revenue to the budget because of the organizational and legal nature of the enterprise.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"To get money from the owner is problematic, it's difficult to talk about borrowing money from large credit organizations," said the minselkhoz of Crimea, Sergei Petelin, in April this year.
The Crimea Parliament included the enterprise in the privatization plan for 2017.
It was suggested that it be auctioned and tendered.
Interfax's source in the Crimea authorities estimated the possible cost of selling the business at $40 million, the investor's investment in modernization at $30 million.
The New Light increased the production of game wines by 2.8 per cent in 2016 compared to the 2015 level of 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World intended to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lv Golitsin as a factory for the production of playful wine in his acquired New World estate.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
The lower-city third-graders destroyed more than 40 gravestones
The Ministry ' s internal affairs officers in the Nizhgorod region have identified the citizens who destroyed 46 gravestones in the town of Lyskovo.
The perpetrators were third-class students.
The first allegation that the tombstones were damaged by unknown persons came to Russia's MDVD in the Lyskov district on 27 June.
A total of 24 people contacted the police on this matter.
As a result, criminal proceedings were initiated under article 244 of the Criminal Code, "Destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites".
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects and two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in watching monuments fall, which prompted them to act hooliganally.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone towards the ships of NGOs that rescue migrants.
Italy warned NGOs belonging to rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue working unless they complied with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," said the Minister of the Interior, Mario Minniti, in an interview with the Tour daily Stampa.
Minnity's warning came the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which had been working for only one year, had refused to comment on the substance of the detailed allegations made against it by the Italian prosecutor, Ambrojo Cartozio.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we very much regret that we cannot continue to operate in the search and rescue zone," says the organization's social media statement.
"We'll be able to evaluate all the charges now, only after we get all the information and we can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juvend Rettet vessel since October.
His crew is suspected of taking on migrants by lifeboats who were sent directly by traffickers to them and allowing smugglers to leave with boats that they could re-use.
At least one such meeting was believed to have taken place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as alleged in the prosecution case file, the content of which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the Italian coastal authorities ' regulations, which control rescue operations in the area, more from humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct essentially implies that the "Juventa" vessels will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Open hugs from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that she considered the new rules to be unnecessary but acceptable provided that they did not cause any "significant changes or interference" in her rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins sans frontières (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minnity said that the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In the last few days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict."
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently stepped up their policies on the Libyan track and, with visits to Moscow, delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have been frequent.
The head of the Russian contact group on the internal Libyan settlement under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, the assistant head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Deng, told the "YO" what the objectives of Moscow were in the region and who he was betting on.
The contact group on Libya that you are chairing is hardly known.
Let's say the contact group on Ukraine knows about it.
And there's a veil of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The Contact Group was established on the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Her activities are supervised by Deputy Foreign Minister Michael Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov.
The latter is authorized to work in a Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
The start of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker Mechanic Chebotarev (in September 2015, there were 11 persons on board.
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, was established, and our work was supported by the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.
How come you're the one who led her?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been invited to chair the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of seafarers from "Chebotarev Mechanics".
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major factions opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and on the part of Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government is based, led by Faiz Saraj. - JO), and with Tobruk (the Parliament's seat, which opposes the Government and supports Marshal Khaliph Haftar, who controls eastern Libya.
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (the Libya-YO Vice-Premier), we were able to agree quickly on the release of Russian seafarers.
It was then agreed that a contact group should be established to make better use of those contacts.
Its mission is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, and engage in dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to associate ourselves with any of the parties to the conflict; we are engaged in dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group, and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
The contact group is now composed of five persons.
These include people with experience in the security forces, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to include in the regional team representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of RAN.
There are no staff members in Libya on a permanent basis, and this is not yet necessary.
Whether there are now Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group has former military members...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
Like when we go to hot spots.
Or such closed cities as Misurata (where militias are based, which played a role in overthrowing Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi in 2011 and have been markedly intensified in the years to come.
We arrived in Misrata in January this year.
We were scared, they said it was all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there ourselves, to analyse the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why the rumors are going on, what is actually the role of Islamists there.
In Misrata, we met with all the members of the militia who were involved in the destruction of the IG in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was taken away from the Russian-licensed "Islamic State"-YO).
We wanted to see them, get to know these people, check out information that they were the ones who played a decisive role in the destruction of the IG in Libya, not the Khalifa Haftar who attributed that credit to himself.
So what's your conclusion?
The Islamic State in Libya didn't win Haftar?
He didn't do it.
Haftar was conducting operations on another front in Benghazi.
And the IG in Sirte was fought by the structures that were subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we've invited the men who conducted this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they came - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April of this year, and the Libyan delegation was admitted to the Federation Council, the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Rosguardia.
We understand that you are present in all Libyan regions, and you are probably imagining the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire arrangements, the elections that were reached at the end of July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or, again, as has happened on several occasions in the past, agreements will be broken, fighting will resume, and the parties will attempt to take power alone?
The fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting was a good signal to us, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, the two leaders have been very negative about each other.
And as for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, and many believe so.
We faced this situation when we were in Misrata, and Haftar boarded the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznets on that day.
It was a coincidence.
But Misrata didn't believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people to come to us today."
But our challenge is to show that we do not support Haftara alone, we are engaged in dialogue with all key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar were in touch.
Does understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level make it easier for him to study twice in the USSR?
And by the way, does Haftar speak Russian?
He's Russian if he knows, he's very relative.
But the fact that he learned from us, of course, makes dialogue with him easier.
And by the way, it's not just him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misrat, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And now they're very good at speaking Russian.
And reaching for Russia, to some extent nostalgic about it.
Do you consider an immediate lifting of the arms embargo imposed on Libya likely?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in supplying Russian weapons?
Of course they are, but as I said, we do not take sides in this conflict or want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like to see everyone in a similar position.
With regard to the arms embargo, there are constant calls by Libyans for Russia to contribute to its withdrawal.
The process of drafting a constitution is now well under way in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and achieve internal consensus.
Then there's the election, which was also discussed at the meeting between Saraj and Haftar.
If the elections are held and the legitimate authority is finally elected (and now none of the parties has such status), the question of lifting the arms embargo can be raised in the United Nations Council.
It is pointless and dangerous to raise this issue now, which will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees swimming from Libya, felt abandoned by EU allies.
Could Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using its ties with Libyans?
How realistic is it, for example, that Haftar troops will take control of the coast and put an end to the smuggling of immigrants to Europe?
It's a very timely question.
We're actively working on it.
The Italians need Russia's support because Moscow has a dialogue with Haftar, Saraj, Misrata and the south of the country.
In this regard, tribes in southern Libya play a major role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it a question of southerners stopping the flow of migrants on long-distance approaches?
So, conditionally speaking, were the buses that Nigerian migrants were driving back?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in continuing these flows.
We hope to contribute to bringing southerners together in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But first, we would like to see a consensus on this issue between Haftar and Sarage.
The head of Government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of sharia law in the country.
How radical is he?
Wouldn't that be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I'll give you my personal opinion of him.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but it is his own position that Libya must be a perfectly normal country - a moderate Islamic, open world.
And he's also actively fighting terrorists.
Where did he get that reputation from?
It is created by countries that have no interest in Russia's communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is a capital, where the legislature, the executive and the judiciary are located.
There's a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us out of it.
And we mixed them all up, and we started to communicate actively with Tripoli and Tobrook.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded a cooperation agreement with the Libyan State Oil Company, NOC.
The NOC director, Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosnefty Igor Sechin made a deal, himself came directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I'm guessing it's a resell.
What other economic interests does Russia have in Libya?
Plans to re-sign contracts under Muammar Qadhafi.
These include old transport arrangements (rail construction), energy (electrication) and a number of others.
Is there anything to pay the Libyans?
Well, they have oil.
So, as with Iran, we're talking about a "oil for services" scheme?
I don't know what the scheme is, I don't deal with these issues directly.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not a big deal.
We are in fact engaged in peacekeeping work there.
What is most important for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans to agree among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya can no longer be a conducive environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task to help the Libyan people and expel terrorists.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical fighters from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that, to date, no Russians or other countries of the former USSR were there.
He said that he had about 50,000 telephone records of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - EO) and no Russian speech there.
What kind of States are these fighters from?
I wouldn't want to go into those details.
Then we'll put it another way.
How many Islamic fighters in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are practically no Libyans among them, no more than 5% of them.
The rest of you are from here.
Could Moscow hold intra-Libian talks like Paris?
That's the plan.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and we have indicated our willingness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
Several visits have yet to take place, and I hope that the time and place of the negotiations will be clear.
At the Czech Museum, the benefactors raised money for an expensive gift to a sick boy.
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Matsola, who has a CDC, brain hydrocephalus and complete blindness, will receive a special treadmill as a gift on August 5.
A useful presentation will be given by Sasha, Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region of Oksana Kosarev, and the director of the Konstantin Bobkov Museum.
The money for the gym was collected during a charity marathon called "Don't Be Tired to Do Good", which took place in Melichov on July 15 on Chekov Memorial Day.
On the eve of the marathon at the museum, Sasha, who lived in the village of Manshkino Chekhov district, received a letter: "I can't see my eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I'd really like to have a treadmill as a gift to make my legs strong, and I'd learn to walk a little bit."
And then Sasha's dream came true!
After serving at the museum, there will be a "Post-Script Concert", a famous pianist and well-deserved Russian artist Alexander Gindin will perform a purry from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melihov, choirs of the Voznesen Davivda Desert, callers of Ilya Drozdikhin's workshop, students of the Moscow Conservatory of P. I. Chaikovsky and the Russian Academy of Gnesin, artists of the Melihov Theatre "Chekhov Studio".
An auction was held for visitors, a book fair was organized, and souvenir products with a marathon logo were sold.
The Melikhovo Museum took the initiative to make Chekov Memorial Day a single day of charity in all the Museum of Podmoskovya on July 15.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk, Gitomir region, near the local football stadium, fired several shots at the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was pissed off by the noise and was told by FACTAM in the police communications department of the Zhitomir region.
The man then entered a cafe nearby.
He had a conflict in the building in which a man used a rubber bullet to fire a rubber bullet, injuring a visitor.
A 34-year-old victim has been provided with the necessary medical care and no threat to his life.
The police and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled by that time.
The law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
The man couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a rubber-bullet device that's been sent out for forensics.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 296 (bullying) of the Criminal Code.
The detainee is liable to 3 to 7 years ' imprisonment.
On the night of 28 July, a shooting attack took place in Kiev on Lukyanovska in the vicinity of the street of Tatarsk.
Michelle Carter's conviction for messages that prompted Conrad Roy's suicide.
Ms. Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months of his sentence behind bars and another five years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who killed himself on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers claimed that both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, wearing red pants and cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing by, squeezed her hands and her eyes down.
"In her actions, she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She didn't admit responsibility," she said.
"She hasn't shown remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a tragic case she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that in his opinion, her "age, maturity or even mental illness did not have a noticeable effect on her actions".
The Prosecutor read out the statements of Roy Lynn Roy's mother saying: "It has not been a day since I mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I do it - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Sister Roy Kamdin Roy said that she was obsessed with the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunt.
"The man who's been with me ever since I was born is the pain that stays with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case is likely to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that provides for responsibility for advising a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with carbon monoxide poisoning symptoms, Carter was 17 years old.
The case drew the attention of the entire country when it became known that he had been pushed into Carter's suicide message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don't know, there are many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before he died while he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and, "You just have to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said Carter wanted attention with Roy's death, and he banned her from talking to the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The legal opinion on this matter was divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British apartmentmate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
30-year-old Knox published his dissenting opinion in the Los Angeles Times, stating, "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Eugene Boggenchev: "I let Langford go like a high-flying bird."
A 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNICS.
The departure of the U.S. Protector of Izvestami was commented on by the President of UNICS Evgeny Bogchev.
Keith made this decision on the basis of family circumstances, says Evgenius Bogachchev.
He's got a little kid, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played three seasons at the UNICS, and in each match he showed a high level, 100 percent.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and his game career.
Keith Langford played at the Kazakh club for three years, winning the silver of the United League 2015/16.
In the 2016–17 season, he won the Euroleague's most successful player.
He scored 21.75 points on average for the match.
This result is the second since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who won the award also in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague history to win the award more than once.
Langford is about to sign a contract with Shenzhen, informing Eurohops.
The American is expected to conclude a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second Euroleague star to go to the Chinese Championship in July.
Previously, Jannis Bourusis, an ex-centre of Panatinaikos, moved to Chinese CBA.
A sun-burned tourist from Underwater was evacuated by a helicopter in Adigea
Today, the Adigean rescue workers evacuated from the Republic ' s mountain area a sub-species tourist who received severe sunburns.
The man was resting at the Fish Shelter, located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand metres.
A 27-year-old tourist had increased his pressure and had difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescue workers were approached by the head of the tournament, who told them that the man had been burned on a camping trip.
Audi to be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW announced that it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman stated that the company believed that "there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions", referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – that were considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Thursday that he was modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called their move a recall.
European car manufacturers actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to promote compliance with carbon dioxide emission regulations.
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of diesel exhaust neutralizing equipment is also increasing for car manufacturers, and it is becoming difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German car manufacturers are under close scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of subduing powerful car manufacturers and ignoring signs of trouble.
Companies try not to repeat Volkswagen's mistakes, which conceal the use of the so-called defeat device, which, during testing, could adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules and, under normal driving conditions, shut down.
In the United States, several Volkswagen leaders have been convicted, while the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany, a former head of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development team was arrested.
Former manager, Zackeo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, is therefore not protected from extradition and may be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, "Audi" came under a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused "Audi" of setting up a system to circumvent European emission rules and expanded an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is the source of a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's income.
In Astrahani, a cafe visitor paid for the fake money.
The police received reports from a bank employee of the bank office that money received from the point of supply had been found to have been converted into a suspect bill of 5,000 rubles.
A study conducted at the Forensic Centre found it to be false.
According to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Astrakhan region, one of the visitors to the cafe bought a shaurmu.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with an authentication device.
At present, police officers are identifying persons involved in the production and sale of a false ticket known to the Russian Central Office.
Such offences are punishable by up to eight years ' imprisonment with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs encourages the inhabitants of the Astrahan region to be careful when carrying out financial transactions; traders are encouraged to install instruments to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers found a "Hell" planet on which even iron can melt.
For the first time, after studying the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysics were surprised by its temperature, which is capable of evaporating iron and other metals.
Experts have noticed that water molecules are so hot with star light that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the planet's atmosphere to glow in infrared range.
WASP-121b is one of the so-called hot yupiters, gas giants of a size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but located tens of times closer to the parent star.
As a result, the year on the exoplanet is only 1.3 "earth" days, and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens the lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but there are now fears that it will be threatened by climate change.
Lavanda has grown worse because of dry weather and vector-borne diseases; this has caused constant headaches among scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the CRIEPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provenza, says: "Lavanda in Provenza is indeed at risk because in recent years this plant has experienced the effects of climate change: in the spring and especially in the autumn, the rains have become much smaller.
It affects the life span of the lavender.
And there are little cicadas that jump on leaves by insects that carry micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, there's a lot of them."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavanda is not only attracted to vacationers; lavender oil is very much needed in perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Shes says, "Instead of very long ears with a large number of large colors, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent.
That's why we have fewer parts containing air oil."
The solutions currently under consideration include improved water distribution and the deceleration of evaporative from the soil, as well as plant spraying with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of drought-resistant varieties.
Ambassador of Winter University 2019 met with Red Yard schoolchildren
The world's two-time hockey champion, Ambassador of Winter University 2019, Alexander Semin, met with emerging hockey players the previous day and handed out autographs to fans.
The meeting took place in the Winter University Hall of 2019 as part of a theme week dedicated to hockey with the crew.
Any visitor to the tent could have skating on a playground with artificial ice.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games were organized with the performance of student souvenirs and the aerobics federation.
The event was attended by 50 schoolchildren.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much as possible in sports and stressed that the most important thing in the initial stage of education was hard work and a great desire to do hockey.
"It's great that Krasnoyarsk has a platform like the Winter University Hall 2019, where beginners can directly ask questions to team coaches," said the champion.
Let us note that the ambassadors of the Winter University 2019 help to promote student sports and healthy lifestyles among red-haired people.
The board of the U.S. University will work throughout the summer season until September 25, reporting to the Department of Winter University 2019.
In the State Department, they commented on what he said.
The U.S. State Department spokesman Heather Nowert, commenting on the briefing by Prime Minister Dmitrymedev of the Russian Federation, stated that there was a need to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
She said that such areas must be found in order to "improve bilateral interaction".
Nowert cited Syria's armistice agreement as an example of such successful cooperation.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
At the same time, Nowert refused to comment on Beardev's claim of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said that, it certainly has the right to speak, but I can't say anything more about it," said the representative of the State Department.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the Head of Government of the Russian Federation, Medvedev, stated that Washington had declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Beardev also stated that US sanctions would be imposed for decades.
Also, the Prime Minister thinks the American establishment is a clean game of Trump.
A missing Bodibilder was found missing in Podmoskov on someone else's memorial service.
Bodibilder Shamil Huntetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on 25 July under very spicy circumstances: he left the car salon to go to the bathroom.
For seven days, he was unsuccessfully sought by acquaintances and locals.
I found Shamil at someone else's service in Ramensky.
He was found completely naked in his toilet by the owner.
The Dagestan athlete couldn't explain how he was here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was missing.
I.D. was helped by the missing person's reports.
Medical doctors who arrived at the call recorded a partial memory loss and a brain injury in Huntetov, reporting to Mash's pavilion.
There's probably other surprises waiting for the athlete.
The intruders who kidnapped Shamil were probably already in his apartment, the keys of which were also stolen from him.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion roubles
In fact, the oil and gas revenues received in July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion roubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The exceedance, as explained by the agency, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the United States dollar against the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the estimate, as well as to the excess actual production of gas and the export of petroleum products at projected levels.
"The deviation of the federal budget's oil and gas revenues from the monthly estimate consistent with the Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 is projected to be +40.2 billion roubles in August 2017," says the Ministry of Finance.
Thus, the total amount spent on foreign exchange purchases in the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017 amounts to 47.6 billion roubles.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency would amount to an equivalent of 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in foreign exchange purchases by the Ministry of Finance.
Every working day during this period, the CEC will enter into transactions for the purchase of foreign exchange in organized bidding by the Moscow Exchange evenly during the course of the trade day.
The acquired foreign currency will be credited to the Federal Treasury accounts at the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
The weekly Riodose newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa involving organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war on drug traffickers.
But today, depressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking children with them to an office where a grenade had already been thrown in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on a board hanging in a room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They asked journalists to give names for each column - no evidence needed, no suspicion and no feeling inside.
They're drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being in government or cartel custody, a whole list of scammers that make the work of covering the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence has not given rise to any respite, and there are more and more journalists among the bodies that are growing in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiration, the co-founder of Riodose Javier Valdes Cárdenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," he wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence is felt very acutely, although his presence everywhere - a large photograph of Valdes showing the middle finger with "justice" hanging on the front of the Riodos building; two reporters in the 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smile, face in glasses or his brand-named panam.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their general trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor ' s office had been set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases had been investigated so far, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As in the case of most of the thousands of murders committed every year involving drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists ' murderers are rarely brought to justice.
Riodose journalists insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, although they are devastated, even though it is far more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice talking about safety at meetings, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"As long as we don't know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the office of Riodoce in the capital, Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of his car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove off in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He still has a wife and two grown children.
Rumors tend to spread rapidly across the Culiacan.
But there's practically nothing to be said about Valdes.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions struggle to fill the resulting vacuum.
Let us not say that every day one or more people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-storey mausoleums of drug kingdoms, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a minute that a state of calm is just when one of the cartels takes control of the maritime state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorquez, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodose, was crushed by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso López, leader of one of the rival cartel factions that fights with Guzman's sons.
The publication may have pissed off the sons; the men who were allegedly gang members bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that wrote about the same story was seized.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroest and founded Riodos with five colleagues in 2003, selling his $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching on the subject of drugs," said Bohorkes.
Over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation for brave and honest publication, sales, and advertising revenues.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, but that readers were attracted to the fact that in this publication they could read about things that no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodose won the prestigious Maria Morse Cabo Award for Reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Award for bravery in investigating the drug trade in Mexico, wherever it leads.
He frankly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to move on," he said at the CPJ award.
The drug trade in Sinaloa was "this way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompiento TV.
"You have to accept the tasks that fall on you as a journalist, either that or you're just making a fool of yourself."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Riodos people miss Valdes, a joker who fights like a porter, a friend who's generous in hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to get back alive.
They relied on the order he ordered.
He was always supposed to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, a bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Has he been destroyed by the love of a single order?
His death also caused them to question their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like you to know their wives, their kids, their legal businesses, and their clandestine airfields to transport drugs.
"These things were behind the line," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in better times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from smelling bad.
The problem, says the editor of Riodose, Andrés Villareal, is that "the smell can be deceived... and then what happened to Javier happens."
Old rules, he says, and others, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a poisonous mix of profitable smuggling routes, weak government institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodos staff gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to bring cell phones: a few days before it had become known that spy programmes, which were sold exclusively to Governments, were being used in Mexico to track journalists and social activists.
Outside, two policemen hide in the shadow of a tree from a 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the state government to guard the office of Riodose, which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois district of Culiacan.
Some journalists asked if the police were part of the 50 per cent of the law enforcement officials the Governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area under the de facto control of gangs of drug traffickers.
In the nearest issue, Riodos had three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of a former boxing champion, Julio César Chávez.
They also had to expose government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the D.A.'s office.
Officially, it was not announced who had been abducted or what happened, so caution had to be exercised when it was time to write that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant for drug dealers and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a policy belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had dominated all levels of government for almost the past century.
Recently, high-profile charges of corruption were brought against several of the governors of PRI.
Villareal asked the journalists to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo Guzman escaped the military raid.
Just a few months ago, readers would have been looking for the Valdes column with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
"We would have known what had happened earlier," says 46-year-old Villareal, for his skinny build called El Flaco.
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources have been severed."
Valdes' office is now used as a poster and sticker warehouse to protest against the killing of journalists, because employees have become what they never thought they would be: activists acting on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramírez took some posters and went to the local prosecutor's office the following morning for a demonstration on another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacán in the west of the country three days after Valdes was killed.
They found a burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, to organize protests and to write SOS Press on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., seeking international support for the demand for justice in the Valdes case.
In a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez Ramírez, the authorities accused them of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then asked that she not be given any more tasks to publicize the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdes has said many times that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime, its accomplices in government and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters were not just killing gangs of drug traffickers; they were doing so on orders from politicians and security agencies who conspired with organized crime.
The Artikulo 19 Press Protection Committee considers that half the attacks on journalists last year were ordered by police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez says.
Of course, killing scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body was found a note allegedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her severed head.
Some publications chose to close up like El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after killing her correspondent, Marioslava Brich, in March.
Others continue to hold on like El Maniana of Nuevo Laredo after the murder of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly approached drug cartels with an editorial on the first page entitled "What do you want us to do?"
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find a job and they continue to look for danger in the streets.
And sometimes they get killed, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance daily with risky solutions.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he's scared to write about the drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for print, Riodose publishers sat on the sidewalk near the office and had a beer when their phones rang at once.
A series of crossfires between rival gangs and security forces near Masatlan spa town left 19 bodies confirmed to be dead.
The war continued to flare up, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted news via their mobile phone on the Riodos website.
The next day, I had to redo the front page.
There were sirens in the area, another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes saw if the officers guarding them were ready to defend themselves.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under the huge portrait of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was placed on the public eye of Sinaloa, Riodose continued his work.
"How can you think of shutting down," Bohorkes said, "if on the very day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her out to report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies.
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, albeit a terrible one.
The researchers reported that the first remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhinoceros found by a Canadian miner had survived so well that the experts called it "Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even determine that the color of his scales skin was red-brown – and say that he had, in some ways, a dark past.
In a report published in Modern Biology, it was described as "the best preserved from Tyreofort in the history of discovery and one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
It's a fossil -- a recently found copy of the nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition has stunned researchers who call it "very remarkable."
This herbal tyreofor is the best preserved fossil of this species in the history of discovery, according to articles in National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the Millenium Mine of Sancor Company near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, work was under way to detect an animal inside the earth ' s surface with a mass of 2,500 feet (1,500 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the final result can be demonstrated.
"It's only worth a little squint, and you can almost believe he's sleeping," said the lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrell Palaeontological Museum, where the creation is shown.
"He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-retained dinosaurs, Mona Lisa, among the dinosaurs."
After studying his skin, researchers found that it was herbivorous, even though it was covered with a shell and resembled a walking tank, apparently exposed to considerable danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful shelled dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used protective equipment known as protective colours, which many animals of today also use.
This would allow him to blend in faster and avoid meeting with his enemies, experts say, suggesting that he was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This creature, aged 110 million years, belonging to the Nodosaurus family, was widely covered in the press in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitcheli in honor of museum labist Mark Mitchell, one of the band's members who spent more than 7,000 hours digging.
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the drawing and shape of the scales and shell plates on his body.
They discovered a protective color, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although the protection color is well spread, the discovery was unexpected because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur far exceeds the size of the living animals with a protective colour.
It may be assumed that this dinosaur was so heavily hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred to mask confrontation as a means of survival.
But most modern animals with protective colours – for example, deer, zebras, or armored soldiers – are much smaller and more accessible prey, indicating that the nodosaurus had to fight seriously for survival.
"The serious threat posed by predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur shell shows how dangerous the predator dinosaurs of the Mel-era were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur scales also indicates that its skin should have been red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the remaining contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where it drowned and lay its back down to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in south Florida, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much deeper than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with the remaining scalp skin, while at the same time it is completely preserved in three dimensions, keeping the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"As a result, the animal now looks almost as it did back then in the early chalk period.
You don't have to use imagination to recreate it, you just have to sneak around a little bit, and you can almost believe he's sleeping."
The small period is an era where giant teropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, wandered around the Earth.
Although the most wonderful of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, a tyreofor could have been hunted by one of his formidable ancestors.
These include acrocantosaurus, a monster 38 feet (11.5 metres) long, weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose latest discoveries are published in Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after his death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum staff, this is the world's best-stained tyreofor, along with the skin and the shell, and it's intact, from the face to the femur.
On average, these species reached about 18 feet (five metres) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic sign was the two twenty-inch spikes that came out of their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbal tyreophorus was a difficult step on what is now Canada, until the spilled river took it to the open sea.
But dinosaur dinosaur's underwater burial has kept its shell as precise as possible.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover the burly shell plates along the skull of the dinosaur.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, the degree of security is "often like lottery winnings".
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
Stoned skin remains still cover burried shell plates that slit the animal's skull.
His right foreleg is pulled along the side, five fingers are turned upside down.
I can count the scales on his sole."
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to enter Poland without documentation
Michael Saakashvili, who had previously led Georgia and then Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
In so doing, he did so without any documents confirming his identity and nationality.
Saakashvili's arrival is reported by the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his performance on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at the commemoration of the Warsaw Rebellion against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, although he had tried to start a speech in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician spoke about Georgia's cooperation with Poland and also about Ukraine.
That the Ukrainian immigration service had deprived him of his citizenship, the opposition politician had learned about it while in the United States.
How exactly did he manage to carry out an undocumented transatlantic flight is not yet known.
Michael Saakashvili, former Governor of Odessa province, had previously stated that his signature on the Ukrainian citizenship questionnaire had been forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The period of investigation in the Weinziher and Olkhovik case was extended until January
The preliminary investigation into the case of the co-owner of the Renova group of companies, Eugenia Olkhovik, and the head of the T-plus energy holding, Boris Weinzicher, was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basmann Court is considering the extension of the house arrest by the accused.
The representative of the UK informed the meeting of the decision to extend the pretrial investigation last.
"The particular complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and examine a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigative activities on the territory of several constituent entities of the Russian Federation", the investigator stated.
He added that suspects regularly bribed Komi's leadership.
Their total size is estimated to be at least 1 billion roubles.
According to the investigation, Weinziher, Olkhovik, as well as Michael Slobodin, former head of the Integrated Energy System, who had led Vimpelcom before 5 September, had bribed senior officials of the Republic of Komi for setting the most profitable tariffs on heat and electricity and for creating a favourable business environment.
Weinziher and Olkhovik were detained, transferred to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped the investigation and was reported to the federal police.
How did one activist know the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to the depths of her soul.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, a St. Louis native sat on a bed in an apartment rented via Airbnb, watching the Facebook tape on her phone.
She ran into someone from high school.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
Noting that no one else in her tape posted that information, confused, she closed her Facebook and Twitter.
There were a lot of user reposts in her tape with @ThePharoah.
A real-time rapper from Grand St. Louis Twittered the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown's dead body, spread out in the street, where it would be for four hours.
"It's savage," Ferrell thought.
But death wasn't something new to her or her circle.
She postponed the phone, and later tonight she went back to tweeting that people were going to Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of a signal tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a poster saying, "The Ferguson police officer just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast as a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, she said, pulled a gun trigger and yelled, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals!"
"This is a non-standard situation," Ferrell said in her own memory.
"It's not murder like the ones we're used to, which we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and crying."
She took a flight back and flew home the next day.
When she landed at 11:00 P.M., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided they were both going to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years was the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", which will appear on the screen on August 11.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell was on her way to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a wreath of color, they remembered the conversation that had taken place before this morning, "the blacks' experience and their situation".
She remembers saying, "Remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're on our way to Ferguson now because a cop killed an 18-year-old boy, and it was wrong."
"I couldn't help not taking her," said Ferrell later.
"What happens today is the culmination of what happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and grow up on it.
It must not only be well versed in activism and organization, but must also understand the different levels of black people ' s experience and status, and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I can provide her with an environment where she herself will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a bad favor if I had kept her out of it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made the first stop on South Florissant Road, a playground across the street from a police station, which was a sort of tent camp, while activists were waiting for reports of the final accusation by Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local businessman who was making lunch packages.
They collected bags and helped distribute them to protesters.
In a little bit of consciousness, Ferrell developed a new type of activism.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at Missouri St. Louis University, she had been President of the Association of Health Students, National Minorities, and had dealt with food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
"I didn't have the experience of organizing.
This is what has come to us."
A few weeks later, at the evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Folayan, one of her directors.
Folayan said that she and her main cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farraer, "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrell thought, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?"
This skepticism was filled with many people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and endurance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of the people who were born and raised in Ferguson are not the focus of attention, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayaan had already merged with her director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his active death row.
His involvement raised sympathy for the project in Ferrell and in the other six local residents with whom the team of the "Whose Streets" project had been in contact for years after Brown's murder.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
"It was the most important thing to me, as these people will be represented, because it is how I will be represented myself."
And while the project's goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience – in an effort to show that the movement "is not about the savior leader, but about how the community unites", as Folayan said, it was the most open of the film participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" shows suddenly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time I saw a finished product.
"But I knew that when you do that job and you make black people human, there has to be some level of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's history again discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the "Black Life Matters" movement.
Two of the three founding members of the movement – those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tags on social media after the murder of the black teenager Treivon Martin in 2012 – identify themselves as homosexuals.
"Black homosexual women in leadership positions support all this movement," Ferrell says. "It's because we fight on several fronts all the time.
Black homosexual women have to bear the burden."
Folayan agreed with this assertion, noting that "the movement is indeed supported by black women and a large number of homosexual black women".
However, she insists that "it is not a case of positive discrimination" and that Ferrell was not chosen as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
"She was the man who raised this energy," she said.
" On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she was on top of it because when "
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, Ferguson hasn't had any cameras in it for a long time, but there are still complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be on probation for two and a half years for closing the highway during the demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of a place called home simply: "Bardak".
She's still holding on to the river she learned when she went to Ferguson's streets three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
Two Salvadoran football players were disqualified for biting U.S. players
El Salvador football players Henry Romero and Darwin Seren were long-standing disqualified for non-sports.
During the quarter-final match of the Golden Cup of the North and Central American and Caribbean Football Confederations (CONCASAF), Salvadorans bit American players.
The first to be distinguished was the protector Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran bit Josie Altidor's attacker, then pinched his chest.
Seren's halfbacker then bit the U.S. attorney Omar González when he served the corner in his punitive square.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three games and Seren for six.
The meeting ended with the victory of the Americans with a 2-0 bill, transmitting a Goal.com.
Similarity: The artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the hall at the Friedman Gallery in New York City, people's faces hang from the ceiling on the wire - white, black and brown - all incredibly similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from the cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent clippings from Fort Lewenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving 35 years for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called "A resemblance."
This is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art unites technology, information technology and art, and Manning, a female transsexual and famous dissident, who Barack Obama reduced his sentence only three days before the end of his presidency.
By analysing the DNA obtained from Manning using a computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of people who might have such a genome, Dewey Harborg created a deep, though not easy, manifesto about not only the plasticity of DNA data - different ways of interpreting them and the inert determinism of these interpretations - but also the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but has openly said since she was a teenager that she thinks she's a woman, was sentenced in 2013 to 20 episodes, including six violations of the Spy Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos in prison were inaccessible, so only one photograph of her was known: a grainy black and white selfie, where Manning, in a platinum shade of wig, was clearly uncomfortable, sitting behind the wheel of the car; with this photograph, she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg successfully completed his 2012 project "Visions of Strangers".
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence such as butters and gums, drawing DNA out of this garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at the preliminary screening of a new press exhibit.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait of her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her prison muse became pen pals and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book of Comic books called "Sacred Images", illustrated by Shoily Kanungo, who illustrated how in the future the president would lighten Chelsea's punishment and allow her to attend the exhibition in person.
Obama's decision to release Manning just a few days after the book came out was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There's something deep and powerful about the exhibition opening now that Donald Trump is declaring war on people who reveal secret information in the government and inventing new ways to fuel the hatred he's supposed to mitigate on Twitter.
When Dewey Harborg was asked about the timing of all this, she said that "nothing happens by chance."
In an artist's statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning's huge signature (with a heart at the bottom instead of a point above "i" in her name) calls for an end to "automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar made of C, G and A pencils.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the scientific artist expresses in a subtle way), Dewey Harborg hoped to show how we all look at each other, at least in terms of our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open genetic data is for interpretation, and how subjective it is," said Dewey Harborg; her 2007 video work, "Lady Memory," is also posted here.
"This DNA can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the show in the same room is the novel in the comic books mentioned above.
It's got a King Kong Manning showing up over the U.S. Correctional Cazarm building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they win," it says there.
"So don't ever shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote me," says the artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I still have the creeps when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person - as it was seen in the comic books - but when she comes, she'll be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room, her own genomic simulations, gathered like a crowd of protesters.
It's also intentional, like everyone at the exhibition up to the height (5'2, Manning's height), where the pencil was painted with genetic gaplags.
"I would have put them on the walls earlier, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," Dewey Harborg says about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement behind her release."
Professor at Northwest University and a staff member at Oxford University are looking for the police on charges of murder.
According to the police, there is a nationwide raid on a Northwest University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects because a man was stabbed to death in a luxury suite in Chicago.
According to Cook County Court records, on Monday, detention warrants were issued for manslaughter without bail for the 40-year-old Windham Latham and the 50-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after being hit multiple times.
A warning issued by Chicago Police said the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell Durano was declared dead at the crime scene, and now the detectives are investigating a stab wound death as a murder, while the police are heavily looking for two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwest University since 2007.
Alan C. Kabbaj, Vice-President of the University for Relations, stated in an e-mail statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was not allowed to go to Northwest University campuses.
"This is now a criminal case that is being investigated by authorized persons, and Northwest University is cooperating with the investigation," said Kabbahj.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
A representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are prepared to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigative authorities."
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
The Chief of the Chicago Police Liaison Office, Anthony Gulhelmi, said that he strongly advised the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have assumptions about their whereabouts, but our efforts to find them are increasing," reported Gulhelmi.
According to Gulhelmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Gulhelmi, the police received a call from the Grand Plaza administrator, who had just received a mysterious report that something had happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene a terrible one.
Gulhelmi reported that it was unclear whether the incident of 27 July had taken place.
According to him, the video footage confirms that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim were in a relationship," said Gulhelmi.
The Grand Plaza authorities issued an address to the residents stating: "The police are currently working on a timeline for the incident, collecting information on the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident".
Russian Vice-Premier Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future."
The Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said that the terms of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) set for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would soon be fulfilled.
"A certain stage of compliance has been passed, and RUSADA has been given the right to plan and conduct tests in conjunction with UKAD (United Kingdom Antidoping Agency).
The WADA road map has been updated accordingly," said Mutko on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map for the restoration of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the reopening of RUSADA and has recently been published on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could present difficulties for Russia.
"It's been announced, it's gonna be done.
The results would be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA shortly," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that the Russian Anddoping Structures must publicly acknowledge the results of the WADA-ordered investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which alleged that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the State.
On this point, Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no government programs, and we will not acknowledge what wasn't."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitalia Smirnov, head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged previous problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly stated that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report indefinitely," Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSAD from carrying out doping controls in November 2015, following a doping scandal.
However, in June this year he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the organization's Moscow office in July, the Director General of WADA, Olivier Niggley, stated that RUSADA was "in the right direction" to restore its work.
Fire out in the 79-story tower in Dubai
A major fire that occurred in one of the world's tallest residential buildings, The Torch Tower, is out, transmitting to Reuters.
It is noted that firefighters were able to handle all fires by 4:00 local time (3.00 msk).
The local authorities reported no injuries as a result of the incident.
At the time of the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper had been closed off.
The reasons for what happened are not yet known.
Previously, it was reported that there is a 79-story live skyscraper The Torch, one of the tallest buildings in the world, in Dubai.
All the tenants were evacuated on time.
The unimaginable outfit of Buzz was a shock to fans: pants that don't cover underpants.
Olga Bouzova's scandalist reality show "Dom-2" struck the audience at the Europa Plus Live festival with panties.
In front of thousands of fans, the new singer-songwriter Nastya Kudri performed the song "We'll Be Hot."
Both girls entered the stage in provocative "brooks" made in such a way that the underwear of singers appeared in plain sight.
The pants were written by Buzova and Kudry.
Previously, it was reported that a specialist from a Moscow plastic surgery clinic commented on the changes in Buzova ' s appearance.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
On Friday, 4 August, Radio 4 reported this with reference to foreign media.
He said that it was the Russian authorities who were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the NATO gender also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and "destabilisation in eastern Ukraine".
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia was nevertheless possible and that further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump stated that relations between the United States and Russia were dangerously low, and accused the American Congress of doing so.
Metro Yekaterinburg is exploring a new way of paying.
In October, travel to the Yekaterinburg metropolis could be paid for by a bank card, as stated by OAO's CEO, "I-Seet", Pavel Vedernikov, in an interview with the Regional Gazette.
Our goal is to introduce into the 2018 World Cup the same system of subway fares as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the uniform, to be able to use the subway with their bank cards without buying badges or standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Aimee Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction of her e-commerce startup staff, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, insincere.
Even though she promised anonymity, some staff did not trust the process.
"He has never been consistent and objective," Errett said, managing a 75-person Madison Reed company based in San Francisco that deals in e-commerce in the field of hair care.
She therefore sought third parties ' assistance.
A new type of start-up is now emerging in the area of personnel, which helps companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software, the purpose of which is to measure staff involvement, they allow companies to conduct rapid interviews, to contact certain teams and demographic groups, to offer staff anonymity and hotlines for complaints and, in some cases, to allow informants to skip the top management and address the directorate directly.
"We now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Glint startup from Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
Herrett explained that she had gained a better understanding of what her staff thought and felt over the three years of Glint's use.
In addition to the rapid interviews and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a warm card for the company and shows in a graphic form which units have more complaints and which managers have low approval ratings, which allows it to understand why.
Companies realize a little bit that they need to control the workplace, or they'll become the next Uber who got caught up in a scandal when a former employee posted a post on a blog that described an aggressive environment in which disgruntled people were punished.
For startups like "Glint," it's a desire to control the situation - a possibility for a profitable business.
The online portal "Let's Talk About Pay" on financial technology estimates that the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
"Convercent" from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year, against the backdrop of a decline in Uber's reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently appeared among clients.
Like "Glint", Convercent allows companies to send individualized interviews of staff, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allow staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is involved, the complaints go straight to the directorate.
"The Court of Public Opinion seized power from the inspectors," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company is mistreating employees or being unethical, even if the inspector does not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by customers, staff departures and lawsuits, Quinlan informed.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with over 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, used Convercent for over a year to make sure that staff were aware of the rules and procedures and to offer a simple way to contact the company's head office.
In the past, if a staff member wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look for a telephone number or a head office e-mail, file a formal complaint and hope that she would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and awkward experience, reported James Vitrano, head of Ruby Tuesday's legal department, who said that there was no normal way to follow up on staff complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harasment and unfair pay – can be found and dealt with more quickly.
"I can draw closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the staff situation," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with staff."
According to Quinland, companies began to take more seriously the ethics, values and involvement of employees in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed due to ethical irregularities as a result of Dela Enron.
But it was only when "social networks became widespread," that companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from viral distribution online.
"Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both "Glint" and "Convercent" offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity approved by venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
"Glint" received $10 million in November from Bessermer Vienna Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than they did before.
In markets with strong competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages, and interesting projects, this is just the minimum necessary.
The staff want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to the company on a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work in a company, feel that they are heard, and that the work they do is working, they are more likely to make such a company a success," says Nina McQueen, vice president for global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors earn income when companies do well in their portfolio; companies do well when employees are loyal and involved.
If the analytical tools of a third party promise to increase the loyalty and involvement of the staff, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to the workplace culture experts, it is important to have data on the involvement of employees.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it may give the impression that there will be a change.
And if change does not occur quickly enough or at all, frustration may develop and staff will lose interest.
"If you're gonna ask 4,000 offers, you should be ready to have 4,000 conversations," says Russell Rat, president of the consulting firm Kotter International, who had to see companies making a mistake relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't go to the end, the staff will wonder, "Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee interviews, is in a position to take action on the same day when someone reports the problem through the Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees, disgruntled decision-making and communication quality, she managed to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long term it will be able to better retain staff in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people," said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose company.
In Barnaul, they're opening a new asphalt on the Krasnoarmy Prospect.
In Barnaul, drastic measures were taken to eliminate the cause of asphalt failures in the Krasnoarmy Prospect.
The place where the holes appeared twice on the newly asphalted carriageway (the youth street crossing) was decided to open.
As a reminder, the collapse of a small section of the road near the tramways was due to the spread of land in the area of a landless unexploited network.
According to Ivan Garmat, Vice-President of the City Committee on Roads, Improvements, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be carried out for detailed survey and elimination of the prerequisites for collapse.
Depending on its outcome, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is anticipated that the scalding of landless communications and their concreteization will need to be restored.
This is reported on the official website of the provincial capital.
The Bruins team has to work longer because the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day.
Time is approaching 11:00 p.m., and a crowd of football players from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed to chat on one side of the new team's training fields on campus.
Some of them pulled their T-shirts out of their backs, shiny from sweat after a tense first day of sports camp.
For many of the team's players, these moments of idleness are a midday break.
The players registered for summer classes will return to dormitories after three hours of training to prepare for final exams, and the next morning they will return to Wasserman's football center for meetings at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins team coach Jim Moore said, "The next three days these guys are waiting for a meat cutter."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on the players, actually extended their working day – at least until the end of the exam on Friday.
So the start of the first three trainings of the University of California team in Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to be placed on an already tight list of players.
The side effect of the absence of two trainings a day has been more days with one training, and Bruins is moving the start of the camp for almost a week compared to last year and is training during summer school for the first time in six seasons of Mora in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have 18 training sessions until August 20, inclusive, before starting official preparations for the first game in the season against the Texas University team A&M in September.
Maura said he supported the change of rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that it had created another point in the player's busy schedule.
"For three or four days, we've given them this enormous burden, this is a serious test," said Maura.
"And they just got over it, they're working, they're great guys.
I think when we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's really gonna be great."
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will shut down the training, which is not easy because its fields are in direct view of the adjacent parking lot and the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombed by footballs that have crossed the security net behind the gate.
Bruins players are supposed to be in the hotel starting this weekend, but Maura suggests that when rooms are available during the season, there may be a problem.
"We'll have security," said Maura.
"It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger, suggesting that someone can rent a room, sit there and record the training on video.
If you have a video of practice, it's very serious.
But we're gonna have security there, and we're gonna have security in parking lot number eight.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I'm not gonna worry too much about that.
We have a plan."
All victims of the attack in Petersburg are discharged from hospitals
All victims of the St. Petersburg subway attack in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported to the press by Vice-Governor Anna Mitinina.
As of the end of July, there were three people in the hospital, passing on the TV Centre.
Remember, the explosion in St. Petersburg's metropolitan on April 3, this year.
The bomb exploded the suicide bomber Akbarjon Jalilov.
The attack killed 15 people, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer of Abror Azimov, were arrested.
It will be recalled that, on the day before, Rossimnadzor recommended that the St. Petersburg metropolitan review the transport safety plan, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook reinforces the fact-checking in the fight against fairy news.
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of mystification to independent experts and show their conclusions under original posts, announced on Thursday the world's largest social network, which is trying to fight so-called fairy news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved engine learning algorithms to identify possible mystifications, send them to be tested and possibly show the results of the check-ups under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fairy news, which many believe influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
This issue is also being actively debated in Europe after the French voters were misled by false reports before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany, before the September elections, they announced their support for the plan to fine social media if they do not quickly remove posts that incite hatred.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that it was testing a new fact-checking algorithm that had been launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what reports are challenged by independent monitors, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgements about what they read and what they share," wrote Sarah Sue, Facebook news tape manager, in her unit.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the "connected articles" function and work on other changes in the news tape to address the issue of fake news.
Create a novel comic book: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s served as a refuge for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy spot in the Bul River Valley in Kent County, he's been watching a stormy story around, and now he's inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire with a cop hair, and a history-oriented, romantic comic book.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says with enthusiasm.
"You feel that way in person when you hold this letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers a period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells about families who lived in Scotty; each story was illustrated by a young British artist, Isaac Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book, based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "Dead Man's Tooths and Other Storys", a collection of British Library documents; this project suddenly touched him to the depths of his heart.
"I could have been touched by a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites," he says.
"It's his fingerprint."
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days the lights were lit.
And 300 years later, in the future, you feel like you're there, too.
Ah, I love archives!"
For a man so passionate about old papers, getting support from the National Foundation and the English Arts Council and living in a castle for four months ("in truth, I've been a bit of a guest there") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes studied the "new" Victorian castle all day, went through the archives and looked at the many treasures of the estate and old things -- for example, the heads of hyenas on walls or bottles that had been lying in a pit for centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to the foresters, gardeners, and sometimes artists working on illustrations of his book.
Then at night, he "drank whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Scotty's castle is not well understood, because the National Foundation did not have full access to it until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassey, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff were just starting to deal with the archive he described as "what the aristocrats have been putting on the attic for centuries".
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned what, "You think that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says, but there were two families fighting for this beret.
That's what happens, guys!"
In some stories, the castle collection is becoming the starting point for broader research in English history: for example, in Workman, the hero is leaving the castle just built to join the 1381 Rural Revolution.
"There is information about the riot that took place at the castle in 1380, in a book called Knight's Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes says.
"The Christian rebellion began in these places, and I thought the riot was a good start.
Maybe they were connected."
Other stories are strongly linked to the castle's history - for example, the priest, who talks about the Jesuit priest who the Darrell family has been hiding for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Contrabandist," about an 18th-century smuggler, Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (which was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug up).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of all Scotty's: "Gentlemen seem to have been a perfect cheater, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women--I imagine them as a company of cute guys who can look after the heirs of great fortunes."
After working at the Castle, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to gain unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish middle of nowhere, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elymanmäki, a place where he was a sanatorium at the beginning of the twentieth century, and then it came back to the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this, damn it, I have to go back to real life."
The 15 largest banks choose Russia.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and the Open, seven other credit organizations are about to leave this public organization.
Thus, out-of-DBA organizations will account for at least 80 per cent of the market.
But this is not just an exit - all the banks that have declared a break with the RBA are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions - the Rossia Association of Regional Banks, led by famous politician Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Committee on the Financial Market, recognized by the last session, and the most effective leader of the Dominus Committee and deputy in terms of the number of draft laws prepared.
The outbreak of conflict within RBA was the result of discussions in the Federation Council when new bills were being considered at the Interregional Banking Council, in particular, which envisaged a new classification of banks according to the size of the statutory capital.
At that time, Garegin Tosunian, President of the RBA, stated that the association believed that the bill was being passed on behalf of the largest banks, which were thus attempting to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clients.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which Tosunyan thought was not always justified in withdrawing licences from some banks, which was, however, objected to by the representative of the BC: many of the heads of the banks involved, in particular the Outerprombank, were in the governing bodies of the RBA.
This exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment seems to be a visible reason for the 15 largest banks to start to prepare for the membership of the Rossia Association, arguing that "the efficiency of the RBA will be low and a constructive dialogue within the banking community will not actually take place".
The contributors will be better off.
How's this gonna end?
In the first place, we will answer the main question that arises in or near the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sphere: depositors will not be at risk, but rather the reliability of the banking system will be enhanced.
Head of Rossia is Anatoly Aksak, known for his sensitivity in all matters concerning the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: virtually all the CB management attends the Association's annual events, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are subject to "regional" peer reviews.
In terms of staffing and organization, it is also apparent that there are no major shocks.
There is no doubt that RBA is in a difficult financial and management situation once such powerful and influential actors are deprived of their contributions and lobbying power.
However, this oldest organization, established in 1991, has considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the monetary sector as a whole.
Nor can it be said that Rossia, with open arms, is prepared to receive new members on any terms, according to the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("may be too much to want"), who, on 21 July at a press briefing at the Parliamentary Gazette, stated that "on the following day, representatives of banks that have left the RBA asked me to consider the possibility of building the capacity of our Association Rossia".
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
A negotiating process is under way, the proposals of both parties are being studied, and an extraordinary congress of the association is being held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of an international banking forum.
That's where we're gonna be.
Anatoliy Aksakov also, emphasizing that "the chair does not hold", called it possible to be the new leader of the renewed Association Rossia of George Luntowski, who will leave in September as Vice-President of the Central Bank, highly characterizing his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now resting in Crimea, plans to suspend his vacation for one day and come to Moscow, for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association of Russia, which is scheduled to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress of Russia.
The entry of petrol-powered cars into the major cities of Russia will not be restricted
The deputy head of Mintrans, Nikolai Asaul, stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol-powered vehicles into the major cities of Russia was not yet restricted.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually upgrade the environmental class.
And that's where the concept goes straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, what year?
It's a slogan-level phrase, let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
We're gonna shut down the whole town?
"In 20 years, I don't know, maybe that's what's gonna happen," he says "Prime" to the Minister.
Earlier, the newspaper Izvesia reported that by 17 August, Vice-Premier Arkadia Dvorkovic had been charged with examining proposals for State support for electric transport submitted to the Government by the CEO of PAO CAMAZ, Sergei Kogogin.
Proposals, according to the newspaper, include the use of vehicles with VANs in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump has announced that a new U.S. immigration plan will be adopted to change the rules for obtaining a green card.
The plan envisaged reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary working visas and restrictions on the granting of family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and are supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing how the US gives greencards to citizens of other countries.
The law would reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will give advantages to candidates who speak English, have the money to support themselves and have the skills to benefit our economy," said Trump, according to American media.
The appearance of sex robots is real, and it should bother us.
Before we knew that 2017 couldn't get any worse, a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots had come out.
Yeah.
Sex robots are in the spotlight right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, the well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we must take them seriously.
Users can choose the color of robot eyes, the shape of nipples, and the type of nails.
"People giggling about it, but firms are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we'll see a lot more of them," said Sharkey at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable fellow robots with silicone skin, warm to touch, and with almost human lines controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also adjust their robots by their own taste, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and colour of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality" that Stepford's wife would seem very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix Robot allows users to set up quality in robots that they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are other sex robots, Roxxxy Gold, developed by the True Company, that are supplied with the already programmed individuality - such as the Cold Farra seems shy, and the Wild Wendy has a "mild" character.
"Roxxy Gold has a character that fits perfectly with yours," the website "True Company" is enthusiasticly reported.
So she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't love, and so on.
She's in a changing mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may be in the mood!
In the emergence of sex robots, a lot of concern is -- not least because they replace real human relationships -- but the most disturbing is the subordinate image of a woman, the association with rape that causes the capture of the Cold (read: resister) Fara.
On the "True Company" website, Roxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxy?" says on the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetish or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and growing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex with submission as an option.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although the FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still on the margins of consumer culture.
But what comes from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are neither bad nor aggressive until the free market allows them to do so.
It's not a coincidence that these complex sex robots came about just when women's rights around the world were threatened, when there was a president in the White House who boasted that he was hitting on women.
The scariest thing about "Woman's Lady's Tale" is not graphic images, twisted bodies, and outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem so big.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve the physical likeness of real women (only with the proportion of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to feel human touch, to copy the movements of the human body.
But the robots aren't exactly like real women.
They cannot break up with their partners or leave them.
They don't have their lives or their biography -- nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
A native of Los Angeles Eugene (Puch) Jether, who has been in charge of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball championship, the final part of which will begin on August 31.
In an interview with BeBasket, Andrei Lebedev, general manager of the Blue-Jelly.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately, he's not coming for family reasons.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
I will remind you that with Jether's direct participation, the Ukrainian national team was ranked sixth in Eurobasket 2013, and for the first time was in the World Basketball Championship, where the yellow blue was unable to make it through the group stage and the U.S. national averaged 15.4 points per game, 3 rebounds and 5 assists.
Jeter has ceased to play for Ukraine since he resigned as head coach of our national team, Mike Fratello, who left the post in 2015.
The Men ' s Eurobasket 2017 will take place simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold their team tournament on the promised Earth.
Eugenia Murzin's clients in Group B will have five fights: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our men's team held two test battles, in which Dutch and Belarusians lost their share of the tournament.
The great work of Trump?
It seems reasonable to act like Mita Romney.
In the Trump era, the common place was the fact that political disputes that polarized the American electorate had broken down some families at the micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers wrote columns on how to deal with the terrible family voting for Trump.
Looks like we're all tense, so we're gonna burst.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, a left-wing poet from Chicago who had been on knives with Republicans in her family for a long time, came to see me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy could have a powerful effect.
At Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother she's been arguing with about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely found herself on the same side.
It's certainly good at dinner; but I can't help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed strength into the left flank, but the distorting effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we'll be no longer struck by his stunts.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the right Republicans, who, against his standards, will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself missing the old-fashioned insanity of Mitt Romney - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax returns looked like) - compared to Trump both seem like a very small evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will simply be in his mind to be seen as a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel in the Parks Department of New York City and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you don't need caffeine.
Horses are monstrous and huge, glass fiber images on the central drum - makeup clowns and animals that look awful at their back - are extremely sinister, and the ringing music, strangely enough, enthralled.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: species from skyscrapers become obsolete, the silhouettes of buildings are too crowded to freak out, and the reality of the city does not keep up with the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I am still going through the day that I learned that the Suisse-Cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet, but a large roundabout in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old kid, an 11-year-old kid, and two women in 40 can have a great time.
If I could give a carousel a grade, I'd give you an A, but luckily, no one asked me to.
And at the department store this week, I was asked to do a one-to-five-star evaluation of my shopping experience before I ran a terminal card.
At the coffee shop on the corner of my street, the same thing, plus the option to accompany the score with a 15% tip is for the order from the counter.
As a result, not only does neutral interaction slow down, but it also has to be personalized in a situation that does not involve it.
The poor saleswoman at the department store smiled at me while I was tired of evaluating my experience of giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
Pistorious is leaving prison because of a doctor's visit for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital to treat wrist cuts, which the prison authorities claimed he had suffered as a result of a fall in his cell.
The pistorious was convicted of intentional murder following an appeal from the Public Prosecutor ' s Office against an initial conviction for manslaughter.
He killed Steencamp early in the morning of Valentine ' s Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the bathroom door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorious said he thought his girlfriend was a night thief hiding in his bathroom.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office has indicated its intention to lodge another protest, this time against the six-year term of Pretoria, which it claims to be too soft.
The Attorney General ' s Office stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be heard this year.
The term of Pretoria could be extended by 15 years if the Public Prosecutor's Office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect of beating a NTV journalist has been selected as a non-exit subscription.
Capital law enforcement officers have adopted a security measure as a subscription for a man who attacked a NTV journalist, Nikita Razzieva, during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on 2 August.
TASS reports this with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Irina Wolk.
"As part of the investigation into a criminal case brought under article 116 of the Criminal Code ("Battery") against a 32-year-old man who had struck a reporter in the Central Park for Culture and Rest in the name of Gork, the suspect was given a preventive measure in the form of a subscription to non-exit and proper behaviour", Volk explained.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol had been drawn up against the suspect for disobedience to the police.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during a live broadcast to VVF, a drunken man approached the correspondent and punched him in the face.
As it turned out later, the bully had nothing to do with the WFD.
According to Razziev himself, the paratroopers, on the other hand, tried to apprehend a Moskwich.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to BBC, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people who had placed tents in an undeposited location, including two Bulgarian citizens, were detained in Sitonia.
They were released the same day, while the result is still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed BBC that Bulgarian citizens were then released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camping facility and have already imposed severe fines on anyone who is caught in a parking lot in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The inspections will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the US vice president of the cold war rhetoric.
Statements made during the US Vice President Michael Pens' European tour were criticized by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"It is regrettable to note that Washington is falling deeper into the primitive ideological strains of the cold war period, which are completely removed from reality," the statement of the Russian foreign policy agency states.
In this way, the Ministry reacted to Pens' words about the "Russian threat" and the violent cross-border attempts he had made in Podgorica.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed to the destructiveness of the choice of "or with the West or with Russia" and the lack of clarity about the alleged non-alternate entry of all South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the US that violated international law by using force to expel Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another source of tension.
"Call upon American colleagues to stop the glooming of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and willingness to work together constructively, on mutual consideration of interests", is stated in the statement of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Feldsher was injured in an ambulance accident in Underwater.
The accident occurred in the subway Stupino, and a paramedic was injured as a result of the collision with the ambulance.
Today, around 08:10 msk hit a Mitsubishi car with an ambulance in the city of Stupino, Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance turned over," said TASS to the Press Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Moscow Region.
There are law enforcement officers at the scene of the accident, and the circumstances of the incident are being investigated.
In Odessa province, a woman threw her newborn son into a plastic bag at the construction site.
On the evening of 3 August, a local resident reported to the Division of the Police that he had found a bag of a baby in an unconstructed private house.
"The law enforcement officers and doctors arrived at the scene of the incident and promptly brought the child to a medical institution", reported to the Odessa Head of the National Police.
The medics determined that the boy was born hours before he was discovered, as evidenced by the umbilical cord.
In the course of priority investigation and investigation, the birth was identified as a 36-year-old resident.
It is also established that the woman has three other young children.
As noted in the chapter, the law enforcement community had not previously seen the family and had not been given special consideration.
At present, the police officers determine the circumstances and reasons that forced the woman to do so, and then a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under medical supervision.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature child into a garbage truck.
Gregory Lepps: "I'm fighting, although 55 isn't 30."
One of Russia's most successful artists, Grigory Leps, will celebrate his 55th birthday next Sunday.
Before the party, the singer spoke to the reporter.
I remember when your "half" was marked.
Special tent at the Stewarts, Gloria Geinor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salutary over Moscow.
I'm sure you thought you'd want to spend your next five-year-old.
Did the plan come true?
As far as the profession is concerned, it's been a good time.
I've worked hard, I've driven three tours all over the country, I've given 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not what I was 20 years ago.
The biological clock's not gonna be fooled.
Singing like I sang at my 30s is getting heavy.
Still, I'm fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
With them, you and your new album, the first in three years.
Yeah, we're working on it now.
As a matter of fact, we've already recorded everything in my studio and now we're sending it to L.A.
It's called "What are you so serious about?" on the same name song that was written in conjunction with Timothy.
She's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we get a video on it.
And we'll introduce the album in November to a series of my jubilee concerts in Moscow's "Crocus City Hall."
A great American drummer named Chris Coleman attached his hand to your new record.
I thought you wanted him to join your touring crew.
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most distinguished drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio, recorded his parties.
I asked him to join my group, and Jeremy Coulson suggested.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put in place, to say the least, excessive conditions.
These were fees ranging from Y35,000 to Y45,000 per month.
That's when I thought I'd find decent musicians in the post-Council space.
And I found a great drummer for Max Littleev.
It's better to feed your own people.
Sometimes I want to fight with one of them, not for anything.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly listed at the international level.
It is written by Western music magazines and invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wye, listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists, with another performer, has arrived."
Your album's down in L.A., and American musicians are working with you, but you still can't come to the U.S.?
Trying to lift that ban?
Now, to be honest, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers working on this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry that I can't go to America.
I've said a lot of things about studying there.
The more you talk to real professionals, the more useful you are.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that kind of experience, schools.
Our artists of popular music for 70 years have not been given the tasks that American musicians have always done.
They wanted to sound as good as possible.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has denied me entry for ten years.
But I'm still gonna apply for a visa every year to the British embassy so I'm allowed to go there again, and most importantly, work there.
The rest of Europe treats me favourably.
And as of August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a booked concert, but a billboard concert, right?
Yeah, there's a good "Sporting" room in Monte Carlo, I've done it once before.
Now they're invited again, and as far as I know, all the concert tickets have been sold out.
To the Lyma Wykule Randev, which starts on July 20th in Jurmal, will you go?
She invited me, and I, of course, responded.
Lyma is a wonderful singer and a great woman who can serve herself and a beautiful vocal, even whispering.
After touring and jubilee concerts, as far as I know, you're the one who wants to turn to Vladimir Wysotsky's work.
You already have two albums with his songs in your disc.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's gonna be completely different.
I want to record some 80-90 songs of Wysotsky about the same way he did it.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
Our famous musician Timur Vedernikov will be accompaniing me.
I'll try to get Alexander Jakovlevic Rosenbaum to participate in the album.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see what happens.
You gradually introduced Boris Grebenskov's songs into your repertoire.
Why don't you write down his stuff later?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I met him several times and asked him if I could sing one or the other of his songs.
He said, "Grigory, I'm writing songs to do it."
Please try, sing.
I guess it's interesting to make a record like that.
I don't have that kind of task yet, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't mind, I might do it.
If you don't focus entirely on the business of your production center.
I suppose until you realized his potential, you signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of artists I'd like to have under my wing, but they're individual, accomplished people.
You mean Sergei Lazarev?
Serezha is a brilliant singer, and I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there's Alexander Panayotov, who I've been leading in Voice.
We made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be a real pity if he didn't reach the heights he deserved.
Trying to get him a repertoire, filming videos.
I hope it's a good result.
I'm also trying to promote other artists in my center: buying them songs, paying poets, sometimes their tracks rotate in television and radio channels.
If they don't reach high altitude, I'm still gonna bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On the way out, they'll get a recorded album, some clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their way, and I won't insist that they return the money.
Although I'd appreciate it if one of them could make commercial progress and pay me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not gonna cut anyone's oxygen.
Let everyone work, get through, prove what I once proved.
If you're offered a tour of Ukraine tomorrow and guaranteed entry into the country, will you go?
I'm still being invited there.
These are mostly closed events.
And as for the big tour...
I was a man of my country, a Russian, convinced to fly to Syria on the same plane that crashed.
If tomorrow they say we have to go somewhere else in the interest of the state, I will.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that this situation has worked with Ukraine.
Because I think we're the same people and we should be together.
I'm sorry this isn't gonna work out, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We met like nowhere else.
A very grateful audience.
And with several Ukrainian artists, Ani Lorak, Light Loboda, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, there are many gifted people, and it is truly regrettable that now they cannot fully spill their talents to a wide Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I'd love to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, like Slava Wakarchuk, and make a concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at the moment...
Andrei Olopkov was thrown from the launch site
As reported by JO, the technical director of the East Andrei Oklopkov launch site began work at the Khrunichev State Space Science and Production Centre (HCNPC).
He had previously been de facto involved in the construction of the East launch site, but because of his disagreement with the management of the Centre for the Exploitation of Ground-based and Space Infrastructure (CENCI), he had been transferred to a plant in the Moscow Philas, where he would coordinate production.
Mr. Oklopkov ' s replacement will not take place: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished and the functional director will be deployed to the units of CENI.
The technical director of the Eastern and Deputy Director-General of the Centre for Technology Development, Andrei Oklopkov, moved to work at the Hrunichev GPCC, and was briefed by the top managers of several space industries and by a government official.
"He's been working in a new position for weeks," the interviewees in the industry explained.
It was not possible to obtain an operational comment from CENCI on Thursday, and Mr. Oclopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, JO's information has been officially confirmed in the GTCC.
He decided to move to the position of Director of Production Coordination, said at the plant.
Mr. Oklopkov moved to work for CENI in 2013, with his career in space forces, particularly in Baikonur, and in Plesetska, in the North Space Station, he served as the first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Oklopkov became a criminal figure.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly from his delivery, regional traders were paid for de-ordering but did not fulfil their obligations to clean the separate parts of the carrier rockets in the Arkangel region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
Its technological development responsibilities in CENCI have been extended to various projects, but the main one has been the construction of a launch site in the Far East.
Oleg Ospenko, then head of the Federal Space Agency, stated in an interview with JO that the situation in the Eastern region "was critical as early as October 2013".
In fact, a strategic error was made in the planning process: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were planned for the same time, at the end of 2015.
In order to make the launch before the end of the year, the construction was completed six months earlier and dates were shifted from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, it had to be tricky: CENI specialists had begun to install technology equipment parallel to the facilities that had not been built.
Andrei Oklopkov was the main supporter of this idea.
Despite the risks and the transfer (instead of December 2015 the Soyuz did not fly until April 28, 2016), this idea has been justified, says the source of the JO on space: "In the meantime, we would not have made a single launch from the Eastern, but would have been building."
Vice-Premier Dmitri Rogozin, who is responsible for the creation of the launch site, called Andrei Oklopkov his "space Susan", a joke, but he was the one who almost always asked for information about the progress of the construction.
Mr. Oclopkov was remembered for his frankness: for example, in an interview with JO, he proposed that the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spectro) be removed from its status as the only performer in the East and work directly with subcontractors: "Why do we have to put all the eggs in the same basket of Special Structure?"
This idea has found support in the Government.
Since 2017, CENI has assumed the responsibility of a general contractor in order to complete the construction and construction work at the start-up and technical facilities planned for the fourth quarter.
According to JO, Mr. Oklopkov ' s transition to a new job was due to disagreement with the management of CENCI on how to complete the construction of the structures and buildings of the launch site and how to work with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that it would be best for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the construction of East.
A government official, in turn, calls the decision odd: "He was one of the best professionals, finding him an equal replacement will not be easy."
According to JO, this would not be necessary: the post of Technical Director of the launch site would be abolished and its functions would be distributed to the units of CENCI.
Music schools will have a two-track programme
In the future, children ' s music schools will be able to receive two courses at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture, St. Golubenko, it is possible to recuperate to students recurrent disciplines, while the question of the payment of the remaining classes in the second field is decided through special grants, which is referred to RIA News.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and we will work with the expert community to develop a mechanism that will allow two fields of study, but at the same time will not contradict existing legislation in the field of education," said Golubenko.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's "Need Child Talk" with the children of the Sirius Children's Centre, a student, Maria Andreev, reported that she had to pay for repeat subjects in a second specialty at CMS under the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she was a violin and piano student and had competition awards in both areas.
The Head of State recognized her question as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian was detained on a skyscraper wall.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian, Cyril N., who climbed the roof of a high-rise building on the wall, reports to El Universal.
The incident took place in Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, crossed a three-metre fence into the Nestle office complex and climbed himself into one of his towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance or rope.
We've got a young man on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security dropped him on the ground by helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
They find out if the young man is legally present in the country.
Meanwhile, the video of a young man climbing up the hill became popular online.
Users called the young man "a human spider."
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help ease the WRC.
Red meat and chocolate are considered nightmares for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests otherwise: diets rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of those suffering from inflammable intestinal diseases.
It is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, leading to colicks and swelling of the stomach, chronic or bloody insanity, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
In order to mitigate the symptoms, patients are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at Washington University have found that the main amino acid protein triptophane contributes to the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines ensure that harmful germs from food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering an inflammation process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance while protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too severe for inflammation, it can lead to inflammable intestinal diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacteria in their intestines have increased cell tolerance.
And this bacteria needs a triptofan -- one of the building elements of the protein -- to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We've established a connection between one type of bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of a normal microbioma of the bowel, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptofane was kept in mice, the more immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same would work for people: a combination of L. reuteri and a rich triptofan diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less inflammable environment in the intestine.
The post-mortem Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganwas, studying a variety of immune cell tolerance groups, found that one group of test mice had these cells and another group, which belonged to the same line but was separate, did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by microbiomas in the intestines of mice - communities of bacteria, viruses, and mushrooms that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the intestinal cells of the mice was sequenced, and six types of bacteria were found present in mice with immune cells but missing in mice without them.
Mice raised in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiom and did not develop this type of immune cells received L. reuteri, and they developed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in the liquid environment and then transferred small portions of the liquid, without bacteria, to unformed immune cells separated from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was a by-product of triptofane, known as indol-3-milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptofane in mice' food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of triptofane was halved, the number of cells also doubled.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people have the same tolerance cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether by-products of triptofane from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans as much as in mice, but in humans suffering from inflammable intestinal diseases, defects in genes associated with triptofan have been detected.
She says, "Perhaps we need to strengthen the development of these cells, because these cells are responsible for inflammation processes on the inside of the intestines.
High levels of triptofane, if L. reuteri is available, can potentially lead to an increase in their population."
According to José Mourinho, Manchester United hired "genius" through Nemanya Matic
Manchester United hired "genius" in Nemanya Mathic's face, believes José Moureenho after a halfback made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, bought for £40 million from Chelsea, began with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season game of the UEFA Super Bowl against Real Madrid on Thursday, and gave the impression of being a halfback, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke forward when they wanted to.
However, since he did not take part in the pre-seasonal tour "Chelsea" in Asia, he was seriously lacking preparation for the game, and he lasted only 45 minutes, which, according to Maureenw, required further development before the opening season.
"He needs time, but his experience, mind, genius is the way he thinks – he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him prepare sooner than later."
Like Matich, his new players, Victor Lindeleuf and Romelu Lucaku, began playing at Aviva Stadium when Moirinho began to form his main team by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Moirinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
"I'm grateful to the club for getting three out of four," he added.
"I'd be more pleased if they got me four out of four, but they've already done a great job for me."
The former leaders of Lithuania ' s social democrats persuade them to remain in the ruling coalition
The former Presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, the ex-Premiers Algirdas Butkjavicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former Speaker of the Seimas from the Social Democrats, Ceslavas Jürschenas, appealed to the one-party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
According to the Parliamentary Gazette, a debate has been initiated in the Social Democratic Party about whether to remain in the ruling coalition due to tensions with partners - the Union of Farmers and Greens.
And here are three senior, experienced comrades who wrote publicly to one party, saying, "It is clear that the party's comrades are disappointed with the results of the election, but the coalition with the peasants has created for us, albeit not very lightly, the conditions for the further implementation of the social justice goals that we have initiated in the Government's programme and for maintaining the political dominance of the left center over the right parties."
According to former party leaders, the debate so far "has been dominated by an emotional expression of opinion without concrete arguments".
The authors of the letter fear that reckless action by their party could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
A fine was imposed on the disabled Anton Mamaev
Mosgorsud reduced the sentence of the disabled man Anton Mamaev from four and a half years ' imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
The convicted person had previously been released from SIZO by a decision of the Timirizaev Court.
At the same time, Mosgorsud confirmed that the accused was a criminal by organizing a robbery and the kidnapping of a motorcade from a former Special Forces fighter.
Mosgaursud reduced Anton Mamaev ' s sentence to 200,000 rubles.
"Mamayev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes a crime, and accordingly such a person must be prosecuted", explained the U.S. Press Secretary, Mosgorsud Ulyan Solopov.
In the present case, the court took into account Mamaev ' s state of health, the factual circumstances of the case and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, according to which punishment may be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Assistant Mamaev Vasily Ceroshtanov, the Court did not establish circumstances that would justify a change in the category of gravity of the sentence and a change in the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he was not satisfied with Mosgaardsud's decision.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be to justify, to continue fighting for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, did not exclude the appeal from the Court of Cassation of Mosgorsud and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the tools up to the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "RIA News."
Remember, 28-year-old Moskwich Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscle atrophy, became a criminal figure last fall.
A disabled person claims to have bought a scooter from a friend for 160,000 rubles to sell.
However, motorler owners, including a former SWAT fighter, claimed that the disabled and his assistant, Vasily Ceroshtan, had taken their property from them, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Timirizavsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasili Ceroshtanov to three years ' imprisonment and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years ' imprisonment in a general regime colony (under article 162, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code).
After the disabled person had been placed in SIZO, the Public Chamber, the General Prosecutor, the Human Rights Commissioner under President Tatiana Moscalkov, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from SIZO by the same Timirizaev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Mosgorsud.
WWF will prepare an environmental report to the President
The final "Forum for Action" of the National People's Front (CPF) in 2017 will focus on environmental issues, inform "Izves" of the source in the FN and confirm the head of the executive committee of the Alexei Anismov movement.
As a result of the forum, "front-lines" were planning to prepare a report to the President on domestic environmental issues and to propose a strategy to address them.
The Izves interviewees in the NPF note that the report of the Head of State will contain a "deep analyst" on the situation in all the federal districts of the country.
According to News, the WWF final forum will be held in the fall.
The exact date has not yet been determined - it is usually aligned with the President ' s timetable, who is the leader of the movement and has traditionally been present at key WWF events.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts in Rostov-on-Donu, Kaliningrad and Kirova.
The outcome will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan Ude.
On the basis of the suggestions made and to be made at these events, we will also formulate systemic proposals to address environmental problems - we told "Izves" to the NPF interviewer.
The Co-Chair of the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, Olga Timofeyev, Central Staff, reported that the "frontoviks" would report to the Head of State on the work carried out in connection with the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the WWF Forum for Action are likely to be combined.
Over the course of the year, we have grown into a powerful team of environmental experts, we have seen legislative gaps, we have stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be included in the report that we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "front-lines" report on the work on the priority projects of the NPF, Olga Timofeyev told the Izves.
She said that Sergei Ivanov, Special Representative of the Head of State for the Environment, Environment and Transport, would also be invited to attend.
He had previously participated in the Media Forum of ONF, which took place in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months' time, the Year of Ecology will be history, and the most important thing to do today is to put in place environmental mechanisms so that they can work for many years.
Olga Timothyev added so that those questions would not fall out of the agenda.
Andrei Koljadin, Head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), noted that, in raising environmental issues, the NSF was working on a presidential agenda.
They offered many things as experts in various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the President, said Andrei Koljadin to the Ives.
He stressed that, to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded, which could give the regions further impetus to development.
In the future, the regions will be able, with the help of the FNF, not only to address their environmental problems but also to develop ecotourism, an expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about a landfill in Balashilia (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Naydka (an open coal trans-shipment ban bill has already been drafted, and one of the authors is Olga Timofeyev).
Environmental experts believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia is generally established; the question is further law enforcement, as well as the position of civil society.
A clear follow-up to the decisions taken by the State is needed - Leonid Bochin, head of the charity "Ecology for All".
A member of the HRC, the head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, Sergei Chickenkov, in a conversation with Izves, stressed that successful solutions to environmental problems required a responsible approach by society and business, and that legislative efforts alone were not sufficient.
As soon as society and business realized that environmental issues were a much better strategic step, the situation would change, Mr. Sergei Chickenkov noted.
The expert stressed that it was necessary to reverse the trend that environmental law infringement was a cost-effective solution for business.
The British inventor implanted a microchip to get into the house and the car by the swing of his hand.
The British inventor was the first person in the country to have a microchip set up so he could open the door of his house, go into the office, and even start a car with a simple wave of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northham implanted a tiny chip between his thumbs and his index finger, and now, through his firm, BioTech offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives at the expense of technology.
He merged with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist consultant from the Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the healing procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is like a microchip that injects cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds to process.
Northam also replaces locks in houses and cars for a chip-compatible price of 300 pounds per lock.
One child's married father has already installed technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House bill cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
According to the records of the armed forces provided to the magazine "TIME", the White House's decision last month to bring a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production was worth $24,000 to taxpayers.
White green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One", when the president is on board, became the central feature of a White House event on July 17, which featured American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence, and the White House's highest officials examined technological products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, which took place in Connecticut, was displayed near a boat from Maine State, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a loader from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1) of the helicopter management department, the White House Military Department ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or FRAGO, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an "unusual" event.
"I just wanted you to know that you are aware because this is an unusual, widely publicized event," wrote Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to his superior, the first Deputy Air Force Chief of the Marine Corps, the day before the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on 17 July to attend an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and remain there until the lawn was released between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to return flight in accordance with restrictions on working hours.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, while the unit ' s guards remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records obtained by the magazine "TIME" whether a second crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 specified whether the activity was in conflict with the order.
"We asked, among other things, whether it was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told that it wasn't," the Commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have anywhere to go," the deputy chief replied.
The White House was declared an official event in America and was not subject to Hatch's law.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance health reform, which was then in the Senate, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as "Marine One" and "air Force One" for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's unusual to ask for them alone in the interest of photo possibility.
Trump was already the subject of discussions in February when the President's plane went in the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was full of complaints about the use of the President's plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled to see "The Work in America", which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 units often perform training flights around the Washington agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the President of the United States to move to the White House to an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
According to an official, the flight performed for the "America" event was credited to the crew for the required training flights in a month.
The unit ' s helicopters also flew 11 additional hours on that day as part of "non-presidential support tasks".
According to the White House, the taxpayers were not paid for any of the other items presented at the event.
A representative of Sikorsky stated that the company had not taken part in the helicopter demonstration on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not account for the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly rate for the 2017 fiscal year, the Department of Defense's VH-3D rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit ' s records indicate that the air time of the aircraft was 30 minutes each way from its airfield at the Kuantico Marine Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than that.
"The calculation of the value for taxpayers based on the estimated rate of reimbursement is entirely wrong," says Walters.
"These indicative rates include personnel, services and many other irreversible costs that are included in annual allocations."
According to a study conducted by RAND in 2015, the rates of reimbursement do not include the cost of personnel, but do take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to demonstrate this week the things that have been done in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to create.
Therefore, of course, it is entirely appropriate to draw attention to this."
It wasn't clear if Trump was in touch with the helicopter, looking at the South Lawn during the event, but he definitely sat in the driver's seat in the fire truck.
Within the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky, making a press joke about his own fleet of products.
"I know well "Sikorsky," said the president. "I have three of them."
Moscow will provide grants to the intensive care units of urban hospitals
Every year, "Save Life" grants will be awarded to resuscitations and intensive care units in the capital.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
The Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyan, visited the Eudin City Clinical Hospital.
During the examination of the clinic, he gave a thank-you letter to Viktor Procko, an orthopaedic trauma doctor, who led a complex operation to reconstruct the adolescent ' s foot.
Sergei Sobyanin also reported on the decision to grant grants to the resuscitations and intensive care units of city clinics each year.
Funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the capital city governor, the Southern Clinical Hospital is now one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received new and modern equipment to enable its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at Colomena Rural Hospital.
At present, the health-care facilities are designed to accommodate more than a thousand patients.
In addition to the ICU and the hospital, there are day rooms.
The hospital has 2,800 staff.
The total area occupied by the clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February this year, the health facility became part of a pilot project on short-term residential care (SIP).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
Surgery involves the use of advanced medical equipment to significantly reduce patient rehabilitation periods.
They only spend a few hours in the hospital after the surgery.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients received inpatient care at the Judin Hospital.
The clinic ' s medical staff performed 15,800 operations with varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported that there were no buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank
In the National Bank of Ukraine (NBA), there were no applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
On Friday, 4 August, TASS reported this with reference to the NBU press representative.
The NBU confirms that, on 3 August 2017, a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Victor Prokopeni, to agree on an intermediate (through Paritetbank) purchase of 100 per cent of the shares of Sberbank, was withdrawn.
"No documents were received from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares in the NBA," noted the communication.
On 3 August, Belarusian businessman Victor Prokopenja withdrew an application for purchase of Sberbank's subsidiary structure.
On 28 July, it was reported that the National Bank of Ukraine had refused to Russian businessmen Said Guceriev and Grigory Güselnikov to acquire the Ukrainian "dog" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by failing to provide the necessary documents for verification of compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation.
Sberbank reported on the sale of its Ukrainian "daughter" to Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March of this year.
Said Guceriev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guceriev, was a major shareholder of the consortium.
Sanctions against the "dogs" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
In the course of the year, they are not allowed to withdraw capital from the country in favour of parent organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, declared to the UN.
Elections can only be representative when all members of society, including women, have announced on Wednesday the head of the UN mission to Afghanistan.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan, hundreds of women were running for provincial council elections, three women were fighting for the post of Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of new registered voters were women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
The choice can be fully representative only when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
The provincial council and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threaten to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from military operations to the role of advisers.
In this year ' s elections, power passes peacefully from one democratically elected Government to another for the first time.
Haysom stated that the advancement of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The Office of the Attorney-General confirmed the indictment against Nikita White.
Russia ' s Office of the Procurator-General confirmed the criminal indictment against the former Governor of Kirivsk province, Nikita Belykh, accused of taking a large bribe.
On Thursday, August 3, this was reported to the agency, and it is being transmitted to RIA News.
The material was referred to the Presnen District Court of Moscow for consideration on the merits.
In Venice, tourist fines for inappropriate behaviour were increased
The Venice authorities increased their bathing tickets from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walking around the city in a bathing suit or naked torso, they will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will be required from those who will take a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle through pedestrian areas to pass TASS with reference to the Russian Association of Tour Operators.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities impose fines for inscriptions on monuments of Euro400 and for garbage of Euro25.
To inform tourists of the need to observe the rules of conduct in Venice, they will be informed by a special company called "Enjoy Respect Venice" (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) on social media, as well as by advertisements and posters on the website of the city council, on billboards and in places where tourists are most concentrated.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the Tourism Adviser of Venice, Paola Mar, the fines will be transmitted to the embassies of the home countries of the offenders in order to prevent their compatriots from making such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she pointed out.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit the flow of turbos.
In Venice, the number of tourists visiting the city centre has already been successfully restricted.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to observe the Festival of Festa del Redentore, only 60,000 visitors were admitted to the venue.
In addition, a moratorium has been imposed on the establishment of new hotels and fast-food restaurants in the historical part of Venice.

Remember, the EU found an unusual way to get rid of migrants.
Jazz at Spalkovo: experiment and improvisation
The programme of the Second Skolkovo Jazz Science Festival was announced and will be held on August 26 at the Skolkovo Innovation Center.
The guests are awaiting presentations by leading jazz groups and soloists, scientific discussions, interactive sites and other musical and intellectual events.
As promised by the organizers, the site will become a site of improvisation and a field for demonstrating new creative opportunities.
"The festival's guests will be able to sink into the world of experimental media technologies and learn how innovation in science becomes a new instrument for interaction with art," described the forum's direction as the Vice-President of the Elena Zelentsov Foundation.
Among the participants, Skolkovo Jazz Science 2017 included many stars, including the Moscow Jazz Orchestra Igor Butman, who will present a joint programme with vocalist Jaroslav Simonova.
Jazz and science are related concepts, and by no chance have they joined together, explained the folk artist Izves.
The experiment and improvisation of jazzmen are as highly valued as scientists.
One of the main events of the festival will be the performance of Azekel, a Nigerian-British, known both for his own work and for working with the legendary Massive Attack and Gorillaz.
The jazz fans of Russia's first five-time Grammy Award candidate, Christian Sands' pianist, U.S.A., are looking forward to their trio performance.
In a new capacity, one of the best academic chamber orchestras of "Musica Viva", led by Alexander Rudin, with the participation of pianist Yuri Favorin.
The merger of jazz, ethnic and electronic music, as well as academic traditions, will be demonstrated by the Marimba Plus ensemble and its leader, composer and performer at Lea Slepner's marimbe.
One of the most unusual festival performances promises to be the set of the award winner Sergei Qurehin Anton Maskeliadze.
An art experimenter controls music and video with gestures -- that's how leap motion works.
Only two scenes of the festival will feature eight musical groups.
In addition, the programme includes open debates, interactive zones and art objects combined with the idea of merging music and science.
The guests will be able to participate in experiments, visit a scientific buffet, and observe the creation of cryofried sands from starch and water.
In the special vinyl zone, it will be possible to purchase records of topical jazz performers and other musical activities, and at the book fair, publications on various subjects, including music, scientific and popular literature and biomedical literature.
The SF released Lake from the post of head of the committee
On Wednesday, the Federation Council endorsed the statement of Victor Ozerov, Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, and released him from his post.
He remains a senator from Habarovsky province.
A request to release him from his post of Lakes was made last week.
He explained his decision to the need for rotation and his desire to "change the rhythm of life".
The Senator also noted that the decision to leave was not immediate.
Viktor Lakes has represented the Habarovsky Legislature in the Russian Federation since 1996.
The Senate has been in charge of the Defence and Security Committee since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for both residents and traders of the Buryatia
The decades-long efforts of the Soviet and post-Council authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electric energy users are beginning to bear fruit.
Since 1 September, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial recipients has decreased by 25 per cent.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Russian Federation, in accordance with the Decision of the Government of the Russian Federation "On the amendment of the rules of the wholesale market for electrical energy and power and on the consolidated forecast balance of electricity production and supply in the framework of the unified energy system of the Russian Federation for entities of the Russian Federation" (No. 842 of 17 July 2017), set indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electrical energy for drilling producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have been living at the doorsteps of Moscow's offices in futile attempts to equalize the region with the neighbouring Irkutsk region with the Angar hydroelectric power cascade from Baikal, for which Buryatia is the main catchment area.
And it wasn't until this year that progress began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 roubles/kWh to 3.93 roubles/kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of the Buryatia by the Federal Government in the List of Whole Market Price Zones, which set out the characteristics of wholesale and retail markets, industrial consumers have come to the fore.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays for a kilowatt/hour of 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to name at least an approximate date for new tariff movements downwards for Buryatia.
Scooter wasn't scared by the Ukrainian Attorney General's Office and flew to Crimea.
The legend of electronic dance music, Scooter, flew to Crimea without fear of threats from the Office of the Procurator-General of Ukraine.
"The flight went well, and I have a concert tomorrow," brings RIA News to the frontman of HP Baxter's band.
Previously, the German publication Bild, referring to the Deputy Procurator-General of Ukraine, Eugenia Jenina, reported that musicians could face up to eight years of imprisonment for coming to Crimea, which is considered to be temporarily occupied Ukrainian territory in Kiev.
Scooter's performance at the Balaclava Festival, called #ZBFest, is scheduled for August 4th.
#ZBFest is hosted by Golden Balca for International Champagne Day.
==History==Scooter, one of Germany's most famous bands, was founded in 1993.
Ace's last album was released in 2016.
In addition to Scooter, the festival's guests will be Sergei Galanin and his SerGa group, as well as Garik Sukachev with Brigada C.
The Moscow subway will be the premiere of the new season of Game of Thrones.
The Russian premiere of the seventh season of the Game of Thrones will take place in the metropolitan area.
That's what Comsomol's Truth Web site says.
It is known that the first episode will be shown on the night of July 18 at one of the stations as part of the "Night in the Subway" event.
There will be actors dressed as white walkers in the lobby under the soundtrack of the guest show.
Also, all interested will be able to take pictures with a copy of the iron throne that will be installed on the platform.
According to the first deputy head of the Moscow metropolis, Roman Latypov, the show below the ground, which will be the first in history, will help viewers to feel better about what is happening on the screen.
The national union of unskilled, municipal and boiler workers (GMB) is concerned about investment in the McVite's factory in Glasgow.
The union requires guarantees from the managers of the McVite's biscuits manufacturer for its long-term obligation to produce at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has ignored the issue of future investments in a small-scale facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, reports that over the past few years it has invested more than £5 million in the site.
The company adds that in the event of any change in the operation of the facility, employees and union representatives "know them first".
In a letter to the company's head of the facility, the Scots Division of GMB demanded that McVitie's respond to the concern that funding would not be available for the upgrading of production lines.
Drew Duffy's senior organizer stated: "The members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot obtain clarity from the general manager of the facility on business needs and investment plan for Tolcross's future."
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in the Great Glasgow; it is the most important pillar of decent work in a territory of high unemployment and social exclusion.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the growth of the subsistence minimum and the chronic decline of production, the East End Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of production at the McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, "The leader of the Slovak facility only received a letter yesterday from the Scottish branch of GMB, and the company will respond immediately because we appreciate our continued cooperation with the employees and representatives of the union."
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with GMB staff and representatives, at which we discussed a number of issues openly.
We talked to the staff about how, like all companies operating in the most competitive and volatile economic environment, we are constantly reviewing our actions – and this is about all our facilities and activities – to remain competitive.
"In recent years we have invested more than Pound5 million in our palpable facility, especially in production lines and improved functional performance."
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and in the event of any change in the operation of this facility, the employees and union representatives will be the first to know."
Putin stated that the authorities would not give instructions to Rosnefti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the Kremlin and the Cabinet should be involved in the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petroleum Company (ECNC), but that Gazpromu would not be instructed, nor would Rosnefti.
Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin's request to help resolve the conflicts that had arisen.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that the relationship between Rosneft and Gazprom should be determined solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNCC jeopardized the project's duration.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue was ongoing.
Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from the Rosnefti perimeter, but we don't have such resources," Sechin added.
It is recalled that Rosneft requested to be allowed to use gas from Kirin's Gazproma field, located on the Sakhalin shelf, for use by the Eastern Petroleum Company.
In June, Gazprom stated that negotiations on this issue were ongoing and "no sharp corners".
Has the WSC warned Barcelona about Neimar's transition three years ago?
A member of the League League may regret his interest in Marco Verratti.
Pari St. Germain won't stop chasing Neimar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of a world record raid three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window when the League 1 Club was willing to break the world record at the cost of the transition, more than double the previous mark of Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transition is over, Neimar will become the world's most expensive player, as well as the world's most highly paid professional athlete, as the PSC offers him more than 500,000 pounds a week net salary.
It is known that Barcelona is furious about the way the offer was made and how Neimar broke the contract, despite the insistence of a source close to the leadership of the Catalan Club that the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned of such a possibility three years ago by the President of the PSC?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in hiring Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaïfi issued a harsh warning to every club that wanted to lure one of the best players in the PSA.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we're gonna come up against them, we're gonna propose to their players," Al-Khelafi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences."
It appears that Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in the PSA's paralegal Marco Verratti.
PSC has made it clear that it will not release an Italian player on any terms, and now probably Barcelona is feeling the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neumar.
Putin has instructed us to deal with payments to victims of forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has been instructed to understand the material assistance provided to the affected residents by the forest fires and the construction of new housing.
Today I'd like to hear how the work is going.
In particular, please report on the status of the payments made to the injured citizens.
I've got some confusion.
"In this regard, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues about how much money has been allocated," stated Putin at a meeting with the leaders of the Baykal regions.
On 4 August, Vladimir Putin visited the Baykal State Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by a representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District, Sergei Myilo, and Leonid Mihailik, Chief of the Baykal Branch of the GHBU, "Glavrybvod".
They told us about the work of cleaning up the lake.
The boys were then shown in an open container near the container that had been prepared for breeding.
At first, Putin released a few boys from the pack.
Then I pulled a special lever on the lid of the container and let the others out.
Also during the visit, the leader commissioned an environmental survey on Baikal and the construction of a road on Oljon Island.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, one volume is needed and another is supposed to be required.
"I want to figure out what's really going on in there with funding," the Russian leader stressed.
It will be recalled that during the 2017 forest fires, the settlements of Buryatiyah, Irkutsk province, and residential and economic buildings were destroyed.
In Ukraine, they offered to send Russians to prison for illegal crossing the border.

Lisa called Manson "a scum" and threatened to "smack in the face."
Yuri Losa expressed his outrage at American rock musician Marilyn Manson, who insulted Moscow.
In an interview with Comsomolsky Truth, a Russian singer called Manson "the bad guy" and "the scum."
According to Losa, foreign artists who allow themselves to make such statements do not need to be invited to Russia.
Besides, Lisa thinks Manson needs to be "in the face" for what he said.
For example, an American artist, known for his euphemistic actions, spoke harshly about the Russian capital at a concert in Kiev.
Earlier on Thursday, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that Manson's statement was commented on by domestic producer Joseph Prigozhin.
