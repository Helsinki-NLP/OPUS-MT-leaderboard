Parliament does not support an amendment giving freedom to Timoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament, in the course of the amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code, rejected an attempt to repeal the article condemning the leader of the opposition, Yulia Timoshenko.
An amendment that would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister in prison was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on the commutation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be unprofitable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will hear Timoshenko's appeal in December.
Timoshenko claims that the sentence is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the trial was also suspected of bias.
A proposal to repeal article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, under which the former Prime Minister had been convicted, had been supported by 147 members of Parliament.
Ratification would require 226 votes.
Libya's Victory
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Qaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert without him, the war is over.
It's time to identify the winners.
In general, Islamists win the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself to be a follower of the customary sharia law we have heard of.
Libya will become a crime-free country, for the punishment for theft is cutting off his hand.
Women may forget emancipation; potential apostasyists will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society made up of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine, and which we hardly would have wished for.
In any case, our way of life is neither unique nor better, and is likely not to be appropriate, for example, to the people of Libya.
Indeed, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted help from unbelievers.
Their only excuse is that, in their view, NATO was not led by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after every blow.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not one of them.
We were involved in the shootings, we served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of benefit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population therefore does not need to worry about the expulsion of the "crusaders".
Although without occupation, will the oil companies receive Libyan black gold for almost no price?
They probably won't, and the West will finally be able to stand up for selfless civil rights.
Unless the followers of the Shariah put an end to it.
A new wave of crisis is beginning
France and the rest of Europe are currently the focus of investors' attention.
The statistical storm hit Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries released GDP data in three quarters.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a state of stagnation, with France and Germany showing growth.
And yet, the debt market is breaking records today.
Investors are already looking beyond Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The Eurozone statistical offices in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany ' s GDP grew by an expected 0.5 per cent; France ' s by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany was doing better than expected (an increase of 0.3 per cent instead of the original 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (the initial information implied stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, in comparison with the previous quarter, GDP was in a state of stagnation, which, according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, confirmed the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key developments:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both the eurozone and the European Union showed an increase of 0.2 per cent over the previous quarter, which coincides with the projections of analysts.
Greece ' s economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2 per cent.
Its 10-year bond is 28.45 per cent.
The income of both Italian and Spanish bonds is nearing a critical point.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the return on Czech 1-year bonds remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, it is said that the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech national team was selected for EURO.
In Montenegro, they won the 1-0 bill and celebrate the unexpected 200 million dollar prize.
The national team has successfully accomplished the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Chech and the beautiful goal of Peter Jirachek, they won with a score of 1:0.
In the second half of the time, the Czech team was lucky to retain a significant advantage after a homecoming match, and will participate again in the European Championship.
IHND.cz observed the match and made a detailed report.
Practically nothing in the first half and great luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly because of the team's defeat at the end; the great Chech; and the heroic Jirachek; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the European Championship.
The Czech team's superior defense allowed the team of Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianovich and Vucinić became the worst match since they missed two great opportunities.
The great Peter Czech is one of the reasons that the Czech national team will not miss the European Championships next year, and Czech football will earn about CZK 200 million.
From the beginning, the game was very tense.
Both teams experienced difficulties in making combinations; the game spent most of its time in the middle of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the master team in the first half of the day, and the long-term strikes over the line of defence were carefully intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
Several hundred university students created a human shield around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
In so doing, they wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday at noon, the prayers of the students in front of the entrance to the building were followed by a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students created a human shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
In this way, they have demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that it was clear that Iran had not abandoned attempts to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday at noon, the prayers of the students at the entrance to the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant were followed by Moleben for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysis of Iran ' s nuclear programme, the targets, according to the Israeli press, would be installations in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Feeding of children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 weigh more than the norm; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren are overweight, 5 per cent suffer from obesity.
According to the latest study, children suffering from obesity usually come from unhealthy families.
Once again, we see the importance of the environment and the behaviours that accompany the human being for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage appears almost twice as often as in families with normal weight children.
More than 19% of children suffering from obesity ate fries for dinner on the eve of a survey on an educational event called Obesity is not an accident.
Moreover, the families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports, but most of the families of modern-day schoolchildren - only 15 per cent of the children said that their parents took at least once a week to engage in sports.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of the last school year and involved nearly 900 primary school students throughout Bohemia.
Obesity was not an accident for the second year in a row, with the support of Všeobecná zdravotní pojšøvna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 pupils in grades 4 to 8 have joined the project.
Good nutrition and sufficient sports effort are the main determinants of the rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either excessive weight or obesity.
"For example, only half of the respondents said that they eat five meals a day, according to the breakfast-food-food-supper-supper scheme, which is one of the best nutritional conditions," says one of the findings of the study.
No lunch and sausage at night.
Experts warn that even relative details such as regular family breakfasttime are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of schoolchildren ' s families eat breakfast together.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast separately.
The worst revelation is that in every ten families, people don't eat breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The study found that roasted food is more commonly used in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweet cool drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly engage in sports, this figure is more than halved to 15 per cent when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to draw up their own menu based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from ideal with regard to healthy nutrition."
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat, and sweet meals.
"A particular concern is the high popularity of sweet cool drinks," says the final part of the study.
As the main dinner meal, the pasta defeated a bird with a small weight.
However, children showed little interest in beans, fish, and vegetables.
Desiring a Healthy Lifestyle
The study also showed that children were willing to change their eating habits, provided that they were provided with relevant information.
"A large number of participants in the survey team showed a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when they filled out the questionnaire after completing the lecture Obesity is not an accident," the outcome of the project.
This was particularly evident, for example, in the case of sweet cool drinks, more children began to prefer them to water.
In addition, children more often marked birds and fish as the main meal, limiting the number of sweet meals and pastries.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, according to professionals.
In the first article on stylists training, I attended to the amount of information in introductory classes.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
Lectures by three experts in this field; advice on the choice of clothing for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how this works in real life.
It's more than that.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time with Alainka, director, (no men in the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One has a short neck, another has a boy figure without proper shapes, another weighs more than normal.
A stylist should know how to visually reduce the wide shoulders, extend the neck, or add missing volumes.
We have been given advice on how to highlight the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. women with bigger breasts and thighs and narrow waist, and not to wear them too glamorous.
For example, if the difference between the waist and thigh is so large that you can't pick up skirts or pants, you should have at least one thing that's custom-made.
Clearly, you won't regret the investment, because the perfect sitting clothes are priceless.
You're gonna feel a lot better in an order skirt than the one that's always moving around, rolling around, exposing the waist, etc.
Male figures, on the other hand, may wear clothes with prunes, applications, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and types of figures, I'm glad I have a whole week to realize it.
Still, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we got.
Each participant in the course had to come up with two outfits for a celebrity, one day and one evening.
We need to take into account their modern appearance, their style of clothing and the type of shape.
I have to wear Miranda Kerr, which you may know from Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm happy about myself because it's a lot easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguilera, who recently recovered by a ton (please bear in mind that I'm exaggerating), or a very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them on the Internet, print and process them using graphics.
Moodboard -- that's what we call the work result -- then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphical image.
It's important to keep a graphic aspect of style in your head.
A stylist does not just dress real people, but creates food pages in magazines (based on special instructions such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenick told us.
But it was only Sunday.
Stylist needs general knowledge.
The Saturday lecture, full of information about the types of figures, was revived by three guests, specialists in the field.
Stylist, Honza Podorna; fashion designer, Jacob Polanca; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Yakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, coats can be worn normally over jeans and T-shirts, like coats; but they can also be worn on a naked body, without bracelets, like a dress.
Another possibility is to roll up the sleeves or lift the collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"play with him," he pointed out.
Anyway, I appreciated the following advice most: "You must know the rules perfectly for your work."
Then you can start breaking them,' told us Yakub.
Here I finally figured out why we're making all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, whereas in fashion magazines we often see things very different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that the stylist should have more outfits than the number of photos he needs to take.
So for a ten-page fashion view (equivalent to ten outfits), I have to be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture, the item of clothing often looks and works in conjunction with others in a different way than in reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Posorna confirmed that often the image and style are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an amazing vocal, but her image and marketing turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards stylistic services in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even famous people often think it's unnecessary (and believe that it's enough to be a specialist in something, and what they look like again).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we have to expect them to tell us a different size than the one they actually wear.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote anything about a celebrity getting fattened/dead, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it was not enough for a stylist to know fashion and to be able to pick up outfits.
Our work consists mainly of communicating with the people we dress; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not to condone them, and to hold their own opinions.
"If the manager asks you to look through her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can't throw away her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are terrible."
"Find at least a few things you can praise and advise on what you can carry with them" says Mario.
He also showed us that he had to have a work bag.
It's a bag you tie around your waist to wear everything you need.
In addition to obvious items such as scissors, sticky rollers, or English pins, it must contain nylon thread (steelers use it in the filming of certain objects, such as a bag or hat), special clips to attach tissue to the back if the clothes are too large (bowls and similar objects are prohibited because they spoil clothes) or sewing kit.
To distract ourselves from the lectures and gain some practical experience, we learned to do the right things on the soles of the shoes.
Even while shooting in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can get damaged - let alone filming on the street.
So we did the sticker.
You don't have to touch a shoe with scissors so you don't ruin it.
It requires real skill.
I was pleased that Mario praised my work.
I didn't like the skills mentioned.
That's only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I'm beginning to realize that being a professional stylist isn't that easy, no matter what they say.
V Need for Speed: Escape occurs in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning trip to work due to a series of totally inappropriate and careless mistakes.
The ambition was met to a certain extent, but it doesn't matter, because no one clearly wanted to do the extra work.
Before the release of the new version, there were great hopes with the subheading "The Escape".
It was expected to move the previous series of "Need For Speed" in a new direction; the demonstration versions showed that the game would take its rightful place in the racing game genre.
We were curious to see the parts of the game where the main hero comes out of the car and runs.
As often happens with NFS, there's a lot different in the end from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the general impression is that there are a few unnecessary mistakes that have been in this series for several years.
So it's not really a mistake, it's an unexplained laziness of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You're becoming part of a story whose main hero, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
This idea has a few interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race runs along its own route, and the individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
So it doesn't feel like the game is always the same.
Although the graphs are at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, it is nice to see some of the tracks.
Still, the game does not cause strong emotions.
While driving through the desert, it is pleasant to drive in the autumn suburbs or high in snowy mountains.
Besides, racing sometimes revives an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert, you are caught in a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful not to fall under the avalanche.
Individual races are rather well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while you're trying to outrun a few rivals (in fact a normal race); then you're trying to improve time (standard race with a second) or you're competing with one opponent.
Among other things, you run into the police from time to time, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's no big deal.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you would have expected (only three to be precise).
In fact, it turns out that it's a good thing to play because it doesn't bother; given all the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more entertaining.
The racing model follows previous models.
It means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a weakness.
If you're looking for a real-life simulation, you're gonna have to look elsewhere.
Yet this model of driving is very suitable for dynamic races, although better options can be found in the market.
So far, so good.
After a while, however, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model isn't so good.
You don't expect a game like this to be a complicated transformation or a collision, but if you have no idea before you hit an object, how your car will behave, something's wrong.
Usually, by passing or passing cars in a dense stream, you sometimes touch a slightly different car, and yet sometimes in a similar situation, your car starts to freak out.
Or she broke up.
It's not important because of the restart system, but it's enough to ruin the fun.
Restarts are designed so that if you break or get away from the track, the game takes you back to the point where it stopped.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you're gonna have to start the race from the start.
It's useful in case something doesn't work out, but you can't rely entirely on it.
Sometimes restarts aren't enough, and you have to learn by heart a separate part of the race.
An important disadvantage of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns have to be done in a certain way, or you're just not gonna fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars in a certain location in the same configuration, regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations where you see your rival travel easily between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you're in there, the cars are already positioned so that you either have to pass them or lose speed.
It doesn't matter when you get close to them; it's arranged that the situation always happens in front of your nose.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game, you find several places where, regardless of the time, the same rival overtakes you in the same place.
It's especially obvious at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand before you no matter what.
The thing is, when he goes in front of you, he makes you look worse, which leads to one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's quickly getting annoying.
Too bad, because despite a simple model of driving, the game is interesting and sometimes so full of events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's happening around you.
It doesn't matter what keeps you bored-- a concept with fifty unique paths, a sequence of races or something.
The idea of changing cars during a race is unusual.
You need to track gas stations along the way, because that's where your car can change, even though in most cases the one you already have is enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports machines are suitable for cities; powerful American cars are for straight sections of the highway; and exotic super-sport cars for technical driving, for example on curved mountain routes.
===Story mode===Story mode is closely linked to Hallenge mode; it is a race by individual sites that you will learn as the game progresses.
Here, you win both medals and points common to Hallenges and story regimes for your personal business.
Many opportunities are available for higher driving levels, ranging from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the Autolog online function, which, among other things, compares your performance with that of other players, and provides communication with the public.
Here's another flaw that's hard to understand; it's an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car will enter the subway tunnel (to be assumed) where you run down the rails in the dark (to be assumed to be so).
Your speedometer shows the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (to be assumed) when a subway train suddenly hits you in the back, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For a few days, our revision discussed whether, at the time of the game's creation, no one really thought for a second, or whether its creators really thought we were such idiots.
The technical content of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression from the video series is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
Although it is a pity that in some critical moments, the quality of the recording has sometimes declined quite significantly.
This is especially true of incidents involving a large number of participants, where a good recording wouldn't help you much either.
Sound's fine; soundtrack's for an amateur.
To please the widest possible youth audience, soundtracks of different styles have entered the soundtrack; but it is unlikely that many people will buy the game because of her music.
The general impression of Need for Speed is that the escape is quite random.
If the game avoided obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
Anyway, the game leaves a sense of incompleteness.
Of course, it's good fun, but prepare to see the flaws blind you like a searchlight at the airport.
Carlov's Glee Clubs will be performing at the velvet students concert.

Ambassador to the EU Viceva:
The Czechs have a reputation for mischief and skeptics vis-à-vis the euro.
"The Lisbon Treaty has caused considerable differences among individual organizations."
"I didn't expect such a brutal war."
"It'll take five or six years before the situation stabilizes, calms down, and all the players get used to their new roles," EU Ambassador Milena Vizenova started his lecture hard at the law school.
She proved to be following her motto, "A clear and open about Europe", in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and their relationship so easily and clearly that many lecturers from the Law Faculty of KU would be jealous.
Moreover, Viceva commended the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"At first, critics said that he was an ordinary gray office mouse who couldn't play a role; I have to say, everyone was impressed by how well he did his part."
"He is a man who can listen at the same time to the twenty-seven member countries, who has excellent communication with them and who has a clear idea of the direction to be taken by the EU."
She explained her new position as a representative on international relations and security as the answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? What number should I call?", that is, as an important step towards harmonization and greater transparency of the Union's policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one's gonna ban our cheeses.
Vicenova further focused on the programme key to the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the Czech presidency a success last year.
The Czechs were dealing with an impending financial crisis; they overcame the crisis and organized an Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at that time was a negative development that caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
Czech representatives in the EU are now very busy.
As the Ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the ongoing fermentation.
In addition, a new seven-year EU budget must be adopted, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be scarce and cost-effective, which areas would be preferred; which countries would receive more support and which ones would receive less; all those issues were in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans that she had brought to Brussels: "On Europe, understood language."
"I really don't like cutbacks, foreign words, and jargons that no one understands.
As citizens can understand, in Brussels, people are not trying to sell curves or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheeses.'
It also intends to make better use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multispeed Europe - Our Future
The Ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered to be Euro-skeptics; as well as people who point out the negative rather than the positive side of things.
She wants more Czechs involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are responsible: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; and, at the same time, a little support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, it noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and the Slovak joins us, the French next to me says, "Hey, what's the meeting about again, the Visegrad group?" and he's not happy about it.
In the future, the Vicenova Union is largely awaiting new strict rules for the budgetary policies of States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considered the idea of a two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe to be more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the eurozone."
"We have a Schengen area, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that countries that wanted to unite, whereas those that did not want to stay away."
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe", Wisenov awaits.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in advancing the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all member countries, not only those of the Eurozone.
Brand history:
IBM innovators enter the second century of their existence.
If someone wants to find a word that IMB's most likely to express, the closest one is likely to be "long-lived."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded over a hundred years ago.
The firm's long-term worth was laid down by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson the Senior.
He believed in his motto that many of the world's problems could easily be solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan, "Think!", became the stamp surrounding the life of the future giant (and also the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her original values, although she was not afraid to change everything around her.
In our first hundred years, it allowed us to transform technology, business, and company.
In the second century, we hope to achieve even more," says the current head of Samuel J. Palmizano's company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of employee care in the same way that Batya in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first American employees to have paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniforms, and a complex system of bonuses for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The long-term relationship between IBM and consumers is equally advanced.
From the beginning, the company had a brilliant use for talented people, one of the world's first companies to eliminate all the discrimination that gave it an excellent choice.
Concurs with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan that a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She worked at IBM for 30 years; she is now director of sales, marketing and development.
Over the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, which have generated many future innovations.
No wonder there's a lot of ideas-- about half a million people working in the company.
An organization with a good reputation
The firm ' s strong position in business is supported by strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, from the point of view of the IBM concept, was more an organization than a technology company," said the Economist Professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM, Rosabet Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve business problems using technology," adds Joe Colony from Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between going to the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies.
It seems to be the most universal technology company - hardware and software development; infrastructure; hosting and consulting - from servers to nanotechnology.
She holds the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, and five of her employees won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a banking card, a financial swap, a bar code and a diskette.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM became the second largest technology company this year (the first in Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking forward
Not all of its products came to the taste of buyers and fit into the age. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; the online Prodigy service; and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is determined by the way forward, you can't be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundations on several platforms -- if they don't work, it's giving up on them.
This is different from, for example, its competition with Microsoft, which is based on and is experiencing a fall on Windows, its operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM ' s main revenue comes from services, about one fifth in each case from computer software and hardware.
While in 1990, with half the capital, it was the strongest manufacturer of equipment.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets worth $15 billion, while at the same time it invested 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the world was hit for the first time by the current economic crisis.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to have done no harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the IBM stock price has risen by a record 120 per cent; the company's net earnings have increased steadily.
The corporate motto of IBM is to change everything except its own values.
It can therefore be expected that even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant will deal with the situation.
IBM history: from cheese knife to space flight.
==History==IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago and its original title, "Corporation, tabulation, recording" was rather complex.
It took the name IBM in 1924, originally called the brand used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was the merger of four companies, which began in the 1880s.
They owned technology such as the legendary "stable clock", i.e., a clock that records the time when employees come and leave their jobs.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who until 1930 also headed the company's board of trustees.
Flint hired a rival company director, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then pushed the founder of IBM into the shadow of Watson's ideas, which remain the basis of a permanent corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as is clear from the name, began with the production and sale of various business equipment, ranging from cheese knives and cutters to cashiers.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, revenues doubled to $9 million, and a massive expansion of the company to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that almost 40 years later his son, Thomas Watson Jr., took his place in the director's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both employees and IBM computers helped NASA control space flights to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, a man flew to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family, the IBM Line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of that time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, while buying a consulting office called PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus focusing entirely on consulting and high-value-added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great strides with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its purpose is to make reasonable use of technologies in areas that have not yet been planned and to improve road and urban management.
In commerce, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trade cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country in central and eastern Europe, IBM founded its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also runs a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters of central and eastern Europe is located in Prague, where there is also a world-level research group dedicated to speech recognition.
Richtarzhova about her false husband:
Iveta, keep the fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarzhova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Joseph Richtarge (53) became the bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoshova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and come home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has laid down clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa may return home, but not as my partner," explained Richtarzhov.
When Darina Richtarzhova provided Bartoshova's house in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And even though she forced Yveta to leave Rjichan after 30 days, Pep didn't leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After a while, Darina gave up, pretending to accept her husband's novel, and now she's finally saying goodbye to him.
Richtarju doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richtarge and Bartoshova broke up someday, his wife wouldn't accept him with open arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one's gonna kick him out."
"But he will end his days not as my favourite, lost and found old fool, but as a man with whom I have a connection," said Richtarzhova, adding that she had already been freed from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
So far, Joseph has nothing to do with his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta, I'm not gonna change that."
"My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our alliance continues to function; I am responsible for repairs, gardens, house and shopping."
"Darina and I are talking perfectly normal, only we don't share the bed anymore," said Richtarge to Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richtarzhova finds new love, he won't bother her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she has a boyfriend with.
I know it's my fault, I'm in love with Yveta, and I have full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Worst Female Habits: Do they affect you?
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually immediately list them all.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, describing a few female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Does your other half complain that you're always shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping at a big sale?
If so, your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for shopping somehow.
And yet, who among you would refuse to take a walk through clothing stores in search of perfectly seated clothes and to try it on (preferably in different colours) in dressing rooms?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men, it could be hell.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait outside...
Eternal Disturbance
"Am I too fat?"
"I have to lose at least five kilos - maybe I should start doing gymnastics."
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you join a group of women who are obsessed with their appearance.
Not that you need to stop looking at yourself, but many men are literally allergic to their partner's constant complaints about their appearance.
The strong gender also agrees that the more complaints are made, the more annoying women are.
The most important thing is order and purity.
It's like an endless story.
Glass washing, vacuum cleaning, floor wash, dust rubbing, bath cleaning, at least twice a week.
You're criticizing your partner for stepping into a clean cafeteria in dirty shoes; kids for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on a window glass in a living room that was so hard to clean?
In the event that you suffer from this "deviation," try to realize that it is not good to fall into extremes; and that your family should not be in the first place in order and purity.
A harmless desire for purity can threaten your relationship as well as your entire family.
Awaiting to Command
"Throw your underwear in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet towels for dishes shall not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Perhaps if men understood that, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Gossip
Some women like to gossip, insult and intrigue against others.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, who, how and why.
Every once in a while, I guess each of us is gossiping.
Let's be honest, that's probably the nature of all women.
Anyway, there are more serious gossip girls, women who often gossip and despise others, and they, especially in the women's working group, pose a great danger to their environment.
The successful broadcasts of Jagra and Vordic helped Philadelphia win.
During the NHL game on Monday, two successful shows of Jaromir Yagra's hockey assailant helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on Caroline's ice, again becoming the most successful Czech player in the game.
In both cases, Claude Giroux used the experience of a 30-year-old star; he added another show and was declared the best player in the match.
The two performances of the match also belonged to Jagro Yakubu Vorochek, a team that played in the same team.
After the match, Yagre told foreign journalists that he had predicted a great evening for Gira.
"I told him before the match he was gonna score a hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that kind of thing," explained Jag, after whose actions Gira scored the goal at the first opportunity Flyers gave.
A little later, the team's second goal also had a Czech trail.
The lock-up Harrican's Voracek took over the puck and handed it over to Max Talbot, who scored it in circles.
A second before the first break, homeplayer Patrick Dwyer reduced the gap with a numerical advantage, but at the beginning of the second half, Flyers was brought back.
Especially Giroux.
He scored a third goal after a successful Yagra performance; his hit was later transformed into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," said Yagre, commending his center man.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it's my turn," added Yagre.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with Tuomo Ruutu and Dwyer's pencil, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger was doing great in our zone."
"He hit the puck, I accelerated, and Reid went to the far end."
"I was aiming at him and I'm glad it worked," described Voracek's impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
The team's champion Jaroslav Spakek failed to complete his match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to an injury to the upper body.
Along with an experienced defender, Kanadiens lost their two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penalties.
Tomas Pleckan couldn't beat in one of their attacks.
More than lost glasses, the home coach was upset by the large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"Anyway, there's nothing we can do about it, we just have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"The replacement was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone."
"What was our weak side," added P.K. Subban's lawyer.
After 30 attacks, the Czech Holkyper Onja Pavelec helped Winnipeggs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Jets' goals, which interrupted the five-game series of defeats, were full of five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five state-owned tourism agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Because travel to the West was severely restricted, travel agencies at that time largely sold tours to the socialist bloc.
Thus, Czech tourists travelled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which led to significant restrictions on Czech tourists travelling to Yugoslavia.
A great paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually in socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation from that country was needed; another individual journey was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies offered to travel to the West, but either you had to stand in line all night with a sleeping bag or you had "good friends" at the agency.
And that wasn't all.
Foreign exchange permits were required for travel to the West, and were not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without a foreign exchange permit, it was not possible to obtain money (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The Czechs spent most of their vacations at home, which resulted in a large number of cottages and summer houses, a habit that continues to this day.
Since 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic has thus survived a real revolution.
While until 1989 the GDR or Bulgaria holiday was the culmination of our travels, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox, which we no longer realize, is that until 1989 we could not freely visit the most popular Croatia today, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need for a visa to neighbouring countries of Western Europe was abolished, marking the beginning of a huge wave of short trips, mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians couldn't afford to go to the West, and everyone wanted to go there for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in the parks in tents because their income at the time was insufficient for a hotel or board.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring your own food (conserves, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech crown, and after decades our tourists can finally freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income grew, which led to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has enabled travel agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by chartered airlines; compared to the past, flights have now become incredibly cheap owing to the possibility of ordering wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs didn't need a visa to visit almost every developed world except the US, which made our journeys even easier.
The next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution took place in 2000, with great demand leading to the historic first direct charter from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have taken Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flights from the Czech Republic will take place in 12 exotic directions.
At present, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another important development of this period, which symbolizes our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished the need to obtain a visa for Czech tourists, and our country has thus permanently joined the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in history in 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their leave abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person during leave abroad, including their expenses at their destination.
The general assembly must elect a president, the threat of the Pata returns.
For about five months, Czech football had no president, and there was a risk that the successor to Ivan Gashek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAZR), would not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburka on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on which election rules to follow.
Without this, one of the three candidates will not begin voting.
Yindržih Richl, Marioslav Pelta and Tomas Pazzlik are eager to lead Czech football.
Gashek left his post in June, and when he left, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong individual who would lead football in the future.
However, the era of Gashek has put football again into a dispute between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became quite evident on 16 September when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the general assembly came to the National House in Prague, Smikhov for no reason, as the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the election procedure.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote in the general meeting - only legal representatives or also officials who had been granted powers.
This point has since been partially resolved by the recommendation of the Institute of the State and Rights that no representation based on the credentials granted is possible.
Disputes over election rules, however, continue.
The Executive Council was also not very helpful, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it was mainly concerned with that issue.
Views on voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: How do we move on to the third round and avoid the Pat?
"The argument is whether to follow the established standards or find another model," says one of the vice-presidents of FAZR Dushanbe Freedom, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided by the statute, the winner of the third round is a candidate who has received great support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to agree to a compromise to consider the winner of the election as the highest number of voters in both chambers.
The Czech side insists on the condition that, in total, the winner must obtain at least two thirds of the votes.
"The two previous rounds would, however, have lost their meaning; this would totally reject the concept of the two chambers," freedom agrees with Moravia's arguments, and he says it would be better not to change the rules and vote according to the existing rules.
Slightly, Tomas Pazzlik agrees with his opinion, although the electoral rules set out in the statute are estimated to favour Pelta more than other candidates.
"I'd like the election to be done by the highest possible statute."
"I want to avoid all possible representativity, as in the previous general meeting," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time; and in his remarks he was largely at odds with Pelta.
Pelt remains optimistic.
He trusted that the new President would be known in Nimbourke; he also hoped that candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"All emotional fermentation will be calmed after today's expected release of the national team to the European Championship."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, people will be more willing to cooperate," says the representative of Jablonec.
Ryhle's more self-restraint.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
"This is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"It could cause another disruption to the general meeting."
"I hope common sense wins," said Rachel.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach agreement.
According to some reports, some talks took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
The extra flight, which was to be delivered, among other things, by Vice-Presidents Dalybor Kucher and Richla to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure, and sought an alternative to bring part of the executive committee to the re-playing site.
After all, the ministerial meeting expected on Wednesday could be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Joseph Dobesch, would like the opposition parties in the country ' s strongest sports association to reach an agreement.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; the creditworthiness of football; and the planned general meeting with the new directorate of Czech sports after Sazka's financial problems.
Pazlik is in a presidential struggle because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If Plzen Tomas Pazzlik, the head of football players before the extraordinary general meeting, saw a strong candidate who would meet all his demands for the president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAÁR), he would not even claim a high office.
"If there was a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and I wouldn't fight for him."
"But he hasn't been found yet," said Pazzlik ČTK.
Pazlik's motive for fighting the fight against the people of Marioslav Pelta and Yindrich Richl is to try to prevent Pelte, who is believed to be the favourite of the election, from joining FAčR.
Moreover, Pazzlik emphasizes that if he wins, he will remain president only until 2013, when another general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like to see this position filled by an experienced top manager who is not too attached to football life.
"I've spoken to a few people I might have thought of."
"It was terrible for me to hear some of them say they don't even want to have anything to do with Czech football at the moment."
"I'd like to change my mind," he said.
Pazlik's main disagreement with Pelta is now related to the relationship of the latter with Roman Berbro, president of the regional football association in Plsen, Berbr, a man of contradictory reputation, who is known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist who can influence the voices of delegates of the general assembly.
Paclik thus considers it unacceptable that Pelta should become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and football will not move forward."
"With Berbra's support, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful to football," said Pazzlik.
He insinuates the fact that Pelta's name was recorded a few years ago during a telephone audition in a corruption investigation; Pelta escaped conviction.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory would bring to football."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Pazzlik, now he doesn't mention his previous saying that he would "sell Plzen if Pelt became president."
If Pazzlick wins on Thursday, he could present his cooperation with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Raihl, whom Pazzlik supported in front of the general assembly in September, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to whom I would turn."
'He's very capable.'
"I can introduce him to the team."
"But he can't run an association."
"I don't have a nose for something I don't know about either," said Pazzlik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judicial brigade led by Ludek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Pazzlik claims he'll risk running the association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer, he has led the Plzen team, which, with his help, celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better."
"Restrict the influence of certain groups of individuals who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals board, which leads to heinous situations," said Pazzlik, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, to Sparta's director Daniel Krzetinski.
One of its priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FAZR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose assistance it will lobby at the highest political level for more sports money from lottery fees.
"This is one of the key points that the new president should address."
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they have to make it clear where the money goes," he said.
Pazzlik does not consider his association with the Plzen Club a burden, although he argues that President FAZR should be independent.
Pelta's connected to Jablonec, and Rachel's connected to Prague Duclo.
"It's not a perfect option."
"And yet I don't see any point in giving my shares of the Plzeen Club to anyone else since I'm going back there in six months," says Pazzlik.
Pelta promised new FAZR rules that would make it possible to avoid the elected Pat.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Marioslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would fight for new rules of FAZR in order to avoid disputes about election rules in the future.
Until the Thursday talks in Nimburke, Jablonetsa's function remains optimistic and believes that the attention from the election battle will be a tangible distraction from today's expected success of our football team.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment in front of the last general assembly, and a two-month delay could thus have been useful to him to defend his ideas about football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"They feel that it's time for someone to lead the association," claims a man who is mainly affiliated with the Jablonets Club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to believe he's experienced enough to run Czech football.
He believes that the present problems are caused by the euphoria that prevailed during Ivan Gasek's reign.
"Unfortunately, the rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June."
"If the different ways of representation had not been accepted, we would have had a president since September," said Pelta.
He viewed the compilation of a key civil association document as a false goal for delegates.
"If I become president, I'll consider it my own personal task, and I'm going to take personal responsibility if this attempt fails."
"This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist," Pelta argues.
Besides, he says he's not trying to identify himself against the background of rivals.
In the past, he had stated that he could present his cooperation with Yindrich Rich, whom he valued for legal education; he was fully aware of the fact that his rival candidate should be his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Pazzlik, who was constantly critical of Pelta.
"He's been in football for over a year and he's made some progress."
"In any case, his attacks were indecent, and many people were surprised by his campaign methods."
"And therefore some of them now question his true identity," said Pelta about his rival, and Pelta himself claims to be faithful to the declarations he made in September.
He considers his main weapon to be knowledge of football, from the lowest-level competition to the national team.
The national team must represent the entire football team.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Bohemian case or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
"Now I'd focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football," the 40-year-old candidate said "TK" two months ago.
He then promised that his election as a football head would not result in the dismissal of staff.
"I'm gonna need to know the job descriptions of individual employees." It was his message to Fearov, where a prolonged period of inter-rule is causing a clear nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the planned general assembly, he trusted that delegates would come to Nimburke on Thursday for good.
"If the only controversial question is how to hold elections in the third round, we can handle it."
"Football needs the trust it can gain only by finally choosing its leader," says Pelt, who two days before the key day of his career remains optimistic.
Richle promises that with his leadership, FAZR will become active.
If Yindrich Ryhl, the acting vice president, were to become president of the Czech Football Association at a meeting on Thursday, many people in the Association are said to be displeased.
Rachel promises that if he's elected, he'll have a hard time working.
He wanted to introduce changes in the system and make the members of the executive committee responsible for selected areas in football.
He also promises to solve the Bohemian problem; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money for football; and to continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Gasek.
"As president, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national team, professional football and youth football events."
"That's not what I'm saying I'll do it myself," said Rachel in his interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player, and I want to allocate authority to the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area."
"I will carefully define the tasks so that in each of these segments football will take great steps forward."
"It's probably not gonna please a lot of people, because it's gonna mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The climate of criticism in the football movement allegedly led him to doubt his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it makes any sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people putting sticks in my wheels and questioning my every move," he explained his doubts.
"But many people told me that I shouldn't give up, otherwise others would come."
"It's a trust I can't throw away," he said.
Moreover, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work was done in those two years, and I don't want to erase it."
"There have been processes that can produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Mr. Marioslav Pelta, were to be elected, the situation in the Association might return to what was before Gashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's something that Mirek Pelta is unlikely to be competent to do."
"He's surrounded by people who would play football so he can only be available to the chosen ones."
"I can be accused of a lot of things, but certainly not subjective."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone because then everyone will be having a good time, not just the chosen minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he refutes the accusations that he will only be President of the Czech Republic.
"Though many people try to say otherwise, I plan to do the best I can for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider dividing the second league into Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league."
"It will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Rachel.
While Plzen's manager, Tomas Pazzlik, joined the presidential battle, Raichl dares not judge his chances of winning.
"I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice president, and I see that I have made some obvious progress," said Rachel. He attributed his successes to savings of tens of millions of crowns in unprofitable contracts, contract negotiations with television, and lottery law negotiations.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Affirming that Pelt was "excluded from the process of returning creditworthiness to Czech football", he considers another rival, Pazzlik, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job at Plzen this year."
"If he's chosen, I hope he'll continue what Ivan Gashek started, without significant staffing changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't distort the facts for his benefit," said Rachel about his opponent.
Europe's Most Beautiful Basins
Jump into the water.
Julia Stanek
Children ' s pools with universal fibre optics and status pools in Budapest: Travelers can test Europe ' s incredible water - and relax the tired body in a hot tub after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder couldn't do without his research trip for the last year and a half: without her bathing suit.
While lying on her back in the water, she looked up at the taste of the well-formed dome, sailed towards the marble heruvims waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admired the carefully re-established ar-novo swimming pools.
She was in a hurry to add every pool she liked to her notebook, with important details about the building and the history of the building.
An architect of Meder's architecture examined more than 200 swimming pools - and now gathered the impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden, which included everything from public swimming pools in Munich to historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest and "functional concrete buildings" in Townus.
Her "travel to the most unusual bathing areas in Central Europe" was carried out through 13 countries, in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited bathing facilities in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old author is a real bathing culture enthusiast.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but it's different in the water.
The only disadvantage is that swimming fans should tolerate blue cafeteria and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe with the tempting smell of coniferous forests or listen to the joyous chirping of birds in the park.
"Once upon a time, I asked myself why swimming pools should always be so terrible," says the one living in Vienna, Meder.
"That's how I started collecting beautiful swimming pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Flashing in the pool and fine sauna oils are such a healthy factor in bathing, because Meder believes that all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes if the builders take on this kind of work. "Instead of the floor in the pool, you have the surface of the water."
"The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All of this is reflected in high ceilings, color tiles, and ramps.
An illustrated 190-page edition of "The Joy of Swimming" contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oasis - and makes you want to jump into the water.
Meder's water collector found several outstanding copies during a study in Hungary.
She found nitrate-rich water in the Cartoon Cave (Miscoltz-Tapolce Cave) and a thermal bathtub filled with alkalin water in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jasberen) as well as excellent therapeutic bathing facilities such as the 100-year-old Sečeni bathing suit in Budapest.
From many heated open basins in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, you can see all of Zurich from a bathing suit on the roof or look at a snowy Arlberg from an open pool in St. Anton, and there's a window in the steam room that allows you to see what's happening on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design is waiting for swimmers in Langenfeld, the Aqua Cathedral in Eztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
In the winter, it rises in pairs of three open shells, which seem very small against the backdrop of the Eztal Mountains.
Algambra in Schwarzwald
Meder's pool collector didn't smell chlorine in every pool.
A lot of thermal bathing suits smell like gray. Arpad's cupboards in Bekeshchab smell so much oil, you might find it hard to believe you're in a healthy source.
The smell causes hydrocarbonates in alkaline water, the water is almost black from the mud that sticks to the skin as soon as you sink into the pool - the healing experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at a certain point in her search for beautiful bathing areas, and when she tried to visit the open pool of the Czechs bathed in Lugačowitz, she discovered that the territory was sealed.
The coupons, designed by architect Dushan Jurkovich in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked at the view of the windows of the red-white-white-Yellow-style Arnovo building, she saw weeds growing between cafeteria tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks is the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald, the Palace of thermal waters in Bad Wildbad.
You'll find not only neo-Roman elements of the post-construction period in 1844, but also an Alhambra-style Mauritanian hall, added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the thermal palace, the favorite swimming pool of the Iris Meder basin, and not just because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's a real achievement - it's so clever to combine such different architectural styles," says Meder.
Diving into a thermal pool in such a palace is clearly a minor activity.
Agricultural speculation
The Deutsche Bank investigates trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tives
Will the Bank stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGL ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann gave the working group the task of investigating the effects of speculation on the world's poor.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
According to one study, 84 per cent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks are speculating on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that the Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the challenges facing the poorest people around the world.
Conclusions were drawn from a study conducted by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis, Forsa, on behalf of Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Schuman, shows that the game of world commodity exchanges raises prices - and banks are thus involved in world hunger.
The consumer advocacy campaign directly targets the head of the Deutsche Bank of Joseph Ackermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley sell the same.
Initially, commodity rates were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand - and profit from the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism, and he promised to investigate the charges and stated that no trade "is worth risking the reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods could decline or stop altogether.
Ackermann's working on his image.
President Foodwatch Thilo Bodé rejoiced at the news, emphasizing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. "The pressure on rising food prices is a blatant example of how banks are now acting recklessly against common interests."
As the bank's chief lobbyist, Ackermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bodé.
"Deuce, the Bank must remove from the portfolio all investments that make money rates on food prices," said Bode.
"It doesn't matter if we're talking about hungry people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's quick reaction at first is surprising, but the director would like to have a perfect image just a few months before he's finished his office.
Deutche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not join the supervisory board as planned.
The elimination of controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
He also has little need to care for the costs - the consequences will have to be borne by his successor.
One in two would give up investment in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, over 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
Bodé published the study on Tuesday; the study was carried out for the Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis, Forsa, on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
No more than 11 per cent consider the investments that place a price on food to be acceptable to the Bank ' s Deutsche.
Many bank clients would also take concrete steps if they found out that their bank was involved in such trade; according to the study, one in two would withdraw the deposits that eventually led to speculation.
43 per cent recommended leaving the bank, 49 per cent said they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st Century House in Vienna
The Pavilion is in a new place.
Ingeborg Winsowski
The Austrian pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and was abandoned.
Now it's being reopened as an exhibition center.
The Austrian pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of a modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, bold enough to express faith in technological progress.
Swanzer's pavilion won the Grand Prix by architecture in 1958 for its lightly floating steel and glass structure.
The building is considered a landmark in modern architecture.
It made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
He eventually became famous for the world in 1973 with his legendary four-cylinder tower, BMW, and her sister, a cup-shaped building.
The pavilion, conceived as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near the Southern Station of Vienna, transformed and opened as the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - and is often referred to as the House of the 20th Century for this reason.
In any case, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - there were no walls on which art could be hung and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna was given a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and its condition has been getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has now restored a pavilion called House of the 21st Century to be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is a section of the Bellveder Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening -- a joyous event in every sense.
Agnes Hussein-Aro, who became the new director of the Austrian Bellveder Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new beginning.
Hussein Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History, with a brilliant young figurewriter who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and eventually became the founder and director of the Modern Museum, convinced politicians and custodians to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations, and decided on how the building would be used.
The new museum was to contain a permanent exhibition of the Fritz Votuuba Foundation, a cafe and a bookshop, along with modern art, and an office building was to be built.
Strict control of & limited budget
Krishanitz was then the perfect candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession, Joseph Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also studied at the University of Technology in Swanzer, Vienna, and the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he attended "almost every week".
He knew the original design and the tasks that lay ahead of the building, a building that had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems encountered during the last restructuring were much more serious, the building was an energy sink, says Krishanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, a reinforced fibre-glass safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced by a high-strength safety glass.
The steel bars of the thermal bridge were reinforced or replaced and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors have created space for the new use of the building, and the hot light well between the building and the street provides lighting - an almost new building, but still a graceful Swanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors were kept and the building was painted in the old red-brown color of corrosion protection.
The hall of the cinema is the same as it used to be.
All of this is under strict control of the museum department and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap and approved by the museum department," says Krishanitz, pointing to the uneven flooring in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite constraints, problems and transformations.
Krishanitz recently noticed that the Brussels pavilion was a rough-- typical "cape in town" story.
This architecture is "always out of place" and still wants to "stimulate real awareness."
The 21st-century house is in a very good place, because there was an unexpected advance in planning for the city, and a completely restructured "quarror of the main station" with offices and real estate is growing around the Swiss garden.
The 21st century house may be supplemented by the second building of Krishanitz, a collector of Francesca von Gabsburg, has acquired the Berlin Interim Exhibition Hall and is reportedly negotiating with the city about its location next door to the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multimillion dollar winter anti-crisis package.
Deutsche Bahn announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of trains in winter.
The number of staff should double.
It'll cost millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and late trains.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn's internal crisis plan, the Bild newspaper reports that investments totalling about 300 million euros are planned until 2015.
Investments are intended to improve the performance of locomotives and the rail network even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of in-house and contracted staff involved in clearing snow from tracks and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the platforms of snow and ice prior to the start of operations and 90 per cent of the required arrows within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of canceling and late trains this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties in passenger transport, as it lacked reserves at a time when weather conditions were deteriorating.
Many new regional trains have been awaiting the approval of the Federal Railway Service for years.
There were also some delays in the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the ICE tracks much more frequently for many years after one of the ICE trains had broken the axle at the main railway station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay many millions of pounds of fines in the United States.
New troubles followed the unrest around Joseph Ackermann, Director General Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank faces a fine in the United States in many millions of pounds.
It's like Deutsche Bank wasn't having much trouble in the home country, the past of an industrial giant in the United States is now over, and Deutsche Bank, with its headquarters in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (Euro106 million) to calm the disputes that arose after bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem arose with the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Authority of Credit Unions (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and pushed credit unions down.
"We're glad we solved this problem without the parties going to court," said the representative of Deutsche Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not plead guilty.
The same is true of Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA president Debbie Matz welcomed the operational response of both banks.
The National Authority of Credit Unions (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
The NCUA is fighting for compensation for the losses that come out of billions.
It's the first agreement of its kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks, and in the summer initiated proceedings against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Doubtful mortgage bonds are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
They're backed up by domestic loans.
This resolved the fate of a number of financial companies when the real estate market bubble burst in the US in 2007.
The American investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life on the crest of the financial crisis in September 2008.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still struggling with the storm.
Investors and regulators have filed a large number of claims seeking compensation or punishing fraudsters.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is behind the largest wave of claims.
It accuses the 18 largest international banks of buying about $200 billion in collateral from American lending organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The Bank also faces the threat of prosecution by FHFA of numerous agreements with a total value of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires that the bank with its headquarters in Frankfurt assume responsibility for the "significant losses" but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and indicated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett is investing 10 billion in IBM.
Buffett's financial guru is actively investing in IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth over $10 billion.
So far, the largest American investor, Warren Buffett, has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the IBM annual report changed his view of investment in this industry.
According to Buffett, he should have known much earlier that IBM first offered services and purchased computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment was seen as a knightly move.
IBM, an IT veteran, has now won the title of "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the American business channel CNBC Buffett, he reported that since March he had purchased 10.7 billion dollars worth of IBM shares.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders in IBM with 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that even IBM didn't know anything about his involvement until recently.
He commended the management that had been able to generate profits even during the financial crisis.
"They've done a lot of work," Buffett said, meaning management strategy.
Much of the time IBM focused on high-income IT services such as date centres.
The founder of the computer industry, now over 100 years old, also offers software and consultancy services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has been avoiding technology companies.
He claimed that he only invested in those companies whose business he understood.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, lubricating materials and machinery.
His holding of Berkshire Hathaway has shares in a long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Münchener Rück), along with some 80 of its own subsidiaries.
81-year-old bought a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and built one of the world's most expensive companies with skilled investments.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
Making it a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable instinct in making money brought him the nickname "Omaha Oracle."
The IBM stock price increased by one percent before markets opened after Buffet's investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is called, is worth over $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he wasn't going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
Undeterred danger
Following the discovery of the Tswickau cell, the Turkish media began to question the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers is talking about the "blood ideology" that's now rising to the surface again.
The murders of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were the response to this report in Turkey and in the German-Turkeyn community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has given rise to long-forgotten fears, and there have been no such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks since the arson attacks in Melln in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There was no doubt, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network now discovered has a scale that is not yet fully understood.
"The rebirth of a bloody ideology?" was the title of the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant of secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be drawn into a right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly by mentioning victims of racial hatred with a silent picket opposite the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkey bilateral employment agreement at a ceremony involving German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light as a success story.
The coverage in some Turkish media was like a slap. "A gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of a series of murders.
The German edition Hürriyet did not miss the opportunity to draw this parallel either.
"It's starting to smell bad" is the name of Ahmet Kylahji's column.
He noted that people had been killed who had paid taxes and had made a significant contribution to Germany ' s transformation through their work.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful raid were strongly criticized in German-Turkeyn Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not previously considered following suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have come to a rather harsh rhetoric. "If they continue to act equally clumsy, migrants will have no choice but to be armed self-defence."
"It's gonna be the best self-defense."
"Peace in Germany depends very much on how the entire network is opened and on the legality of punishment," writes Selen.
The crimes in Melln and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example that peace in Germany was threatened.
A photograph of burned ruins in Zolingen is deeply remembered by the Germans and Turks.
No other event revealed to the Turks so clearly living here that they were in danger and to the Germans that mistrust and indifference could lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity of the Turks.
Do not repeat mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at that time condemned mainly the German police ' s failures after the attacks, and Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mellene.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the arson attacks in Zolingen, but his Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel, took part in a memorial ceremony in Cologne in his speech, calculating the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
It's as if he had determined the value of a man by the taxes that he pays.
The current coverage of the Turkish media has once again shown how the mistrust of the current German state has deepened since then in many German Turks.
By clearly showing what needs to be done now, in addition to efforts to identify and reassess right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
A bank scandal on Zurich Lake
Most of Europe's risk-taking banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been struggling with one or the other crisis ever since.
Now it's up to the German to get him back on track.
Alex Webber probably didn't know he was gonna get that part.
In July, following his spectacular departure from the position of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would begin to serve in a no less effective position, the President of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; a unexpected and profitable career move.
Alex Webber was clearly thrilled, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its newfound strength, and made some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS managed to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel."
But it became clear in September that things would be different.
The UBS Trader in London bypassed the bank's security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The UBS Executive Director, Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the president of the UBS Board of Directors has been considered sick, and everyone wants to know, when will Alex Webber finally take office?
Webber is due to consult the bank from February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he will be presiding over the board in May, not 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Webber.
He's a professor of economics and a specialist at the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he's definitely gonna need some time to adapt.
He was suddenly responsible for the bank's strategy, which proved once again that he had long earned the title of "the biggest bank scandal in Europe."
UBS, on the one hand, is very large -- until recently, he managed the world ' s largest assets -- and on the other, he hasn ' t been coming out of scandals for years.
A proud Swiss bank seems to spare nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The Bank combined the image of a sneaky and stable yet smart asset manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the biggest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus managing more money for wealthy customers than any other bank in the world,
And as an investment bank, he joined the league of the world's largest banks.
It was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and banking professor who has long been a professor at the University of Zurich Banking Institute, explains: "I have always used UBS students as a model for a good bank."
"Knowing what we know now, you can ask me how I could have been so wrong."
He was really very wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was going wrong in UBS.
In mid-year, Executive Director Peter Wuffley, who was considered an outstanding intellectual and equally brilliant banker, suddenly resigned from his post.
A few months later, we could guess why he left.
The bank's investment unit tried to play on sub-standard securities and had to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS reported a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to confront the crisis.
The Bank has indeed been able to find investors - but investors whose services many bankers would have politely refused recently - one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund so hidden that even its name has not been disclosed.
It was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it was much worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, and the chairman of the board of directors, Marcel Ospell, the second-largest board chairman in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, there was a disaster, and because of a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS faced the threat of collapse, and the State had to save it.
The national bank purchased toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with mandatory conversion to become a joint owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked: the country realized the dramatic consequences of the fact that huge banks had settled in a small country.
After all, the final balance of UBS in 2007 was five times larger than the total production of Switzerland (see graph).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says the bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first one.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the U.S. and stated that he was willing to hand over data to wealthy customers who might have been tax-exempted with the help of the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of refunds of unjustified business income plus fines.
UBS thus more or less admitted to being a tax evasion tool.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in fighting for rich clients - the veil of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The client's money has begun to flow.
In a few months, the bank lost confidence in both its main areas of activity, investing in failed speculation and asset management as a result of aid and tax evasion.
And only things calmed down, and it seemed like UBS had managed to break the situation, like this disaster with a trader fraudster, and one single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
One thing is clear: risk management at the investment office is not yet operational.
"The Adoboli incident has made it clear that risk control has not changed enough," says Martin Janssen, Professor of Economics and Finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks has no doubt either: "The UBS problem is that he does not have a risk control tool."
It is caution that has long made Swiss bankers custodians of the world ' s largest assets - not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, whether or not the world fell apart outside the Alpine Republic.
Swiss bank safes have become a symbol of permanent reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli represent sophisticated taste in chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich is still in line with the image of a worthy Swiss private bank, but it's a little bigger.
It's a classic itself.
The bank ' s head office is located in Zurich on Bankhofstrasse, which leads from the main station to the Zurich Lake, surrounded by snowcaps of Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among traditional Swiss stores like Confiserie Sprüngli, you can find jewelry companies like Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to Credie Suisse Palace and elite private banks like Julius Bur.
A heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
There are big leather couchs along the marble walls, next to the bank's emblem, a large safe sign.
UBS knows what his clients need, reliability.
But both of the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point, abandoned Swiss notions of banking - or, according to the head of one of the small Swiss banks, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the paper-- like all Swiss bankers, he's also working with the two biggest banks.
He thinks that UBS has become too large - particularly in investment banking, where the English-saxes are very active.
In his opinion, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"And if there is something, then they have long adapted to the English-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it the first big profits -- and then the fiasco -- that no other financial institution in Europe lost as much money in the jungle of sub-standard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the country's history," writes Lucas Hassig in her book The Crash UBS.
Politicians have approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have come to this?
If you ask Swiss banks, they say the problem is mostly UBS size.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed that was too large for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
The two banks that formed UBS were complementary to each other, one was a rich but advanced bank specialized in Zurich in asset management; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a lot of money they could use to spin an all-powerful wheel.
Two names relate to the growth of UBS: Peter Wolffley, Executive Director of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospell, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolffley and Ospell were a dream team," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulffley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understanding models and statistics, and Ospell, with his inner instinct, has gone all the way upstairs, starting with an intern at the bank."
But Ospell finally relied on Wolffley.
And Wolffley could have made a critical mistake. "He decided his models were real," Geiger says.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS officials remember very well the board members' meetings, where Wolffley always repeated the same slogan: move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he led the "turning table" to which the banks' successes were placed.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make a part of it.
UBS was the largest player in currency trading and government securities.
The authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weakness, a parameter called "permanent income" in banking terminology that UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failed in American mortgage products.
To shut the hole, UBS got involved in an adventure that almost cost him his life.
In pursuit of growth, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in United States sub-standard securities.
This evolved into a large mechanism that combined securities based on American mortgages and sold them further, continuing to carry the risks themselves.
Even when other banks were long looking for a way out of this process, UBS never stopped.
"UBS bought up until summer 2007, when the American real estate market was already on fire," says the bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the height, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to clean up the bank proved to be more difficult than originally thought.
Posting into UBS has become a child's game with chairs and remains unreliable until today.
Anyone who leads this huge bank is faced with an almost impossible task.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that turns its back on all existing business models.
Bank analyst Geiger already has the idea of giving up investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting about his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go this far.
Nevertheless, it is clear that investment needs to be substantially reduced.
The new head of the Bank, Sergio Hermotty, is planning to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
A 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually seen only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with its predecessor, Grubel.
Since then, he has been able to demonstrate character, and now, as the Zurich Bank said on Tuesday, he is leading UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotty plans to return the investment bank to the state he was in in the mid-1990s.
It cuts 3,500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
Axl Weber must be asking these questions.
Publicly, he still said that he and his wife were looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.

"We're not on the island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe was unlikely to quickly shake down the recession and that banks showed further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett was only able to confirm these fears, and in an interview with CNBC, he said that it was not clear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything it needed to end the crisis.
He therefore felt that it was too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a ten-year-long principle into the trash can and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM of more than $10 billion raised the stock price of this oldest company by almost 1 per cent against the trend during the bidding.

Thinking crows fill cities
Grachi are considered troublebirds in many places, and experts today say that these very smart birds can no longer be driven out of cities.
Some love birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, and the crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but the inhabitants who complain about dirt and noise are growing in many localities.
The solution to the problem of birds, however, is far from being achieved.
At the first symposium on crows in the town of Ler in East Frizia, experts argued that the grudges could no longer be expelled from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have discussed possible solutions.
Finding alternatives in cities
Conservatives argued that the root of the urban problem was the migration of specially protected worms, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture had increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction and cutting of traditional trees for nesting made it difficult for birds to live.
The crows are under guard.
There are large colonies in the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the north-west in Yevera, Dipholce, Ahima, near Bremen and Lere, with more than 600 parent couples.
A mixed project of shooting crows in Leare caused unconscionable headlines in 2005.
Critics described the trapping of birds and the stabbing of birds as particularly violent.
"Normal movement and frightening do nothing." said the architect and landscaper Werner Clever of Lere.
The shooting down of water or tree felling is often undesirable, according to the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"The living are dispersed and the large colonies are divided and extended to other areas."
Disturbance is only possible by way of exception near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We're gonna have to live with them, getting rid of them is not an option."
In isolation from the surrounding areas, the urban problem will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
The combination of scaring birds away from protected areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be an exit.
"Information booths instead of chainsaws" was a slogan proposed by Uta's psychologist and ethnologist Maria Juergens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We need to be sure of ourselves to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational crow route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information about the lives of very clever ravens is posted on the information booths.
The project is already attracting interest from tourists.
Juergens also expressed her opinion on complaints about noise from birds. "The noise transmits a lot of information. They have a lot to say to each other."
Graci often not only use guns to take over a piece but also make their own guns.
Behavior studies at Cambridge University have recently tested a bird's mind on four groves.
In one experiment, birds quickly realized that it was necessary to knock on the tablet to get a moth larvae.
Without much training, they recognized the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the tablet.
In another experiment, smart-ass grocers had to solve a more complex problem.
Researchers put a small bucket with a moth larvae in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get their beaks.
But researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used wire to make hooks and used hooks to pull a bucket by the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four saddies have done it since their first attempt.
Ronaldo takes Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of the Bosniacs and the Turks to win at the last minute were long overdue.

Then Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was the focus of attention.
Following the attack on Elder Postig in the Bosniac penalty yard at 36 minutes, Stark decided that the Portuguese player was faking and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also imposed questionable penalties for the game with his hand after Fal Fabio Quentran - Misimović carried it out.
After the 2004 break, the Vice Champions of Europe secured the account with four more goals.
Peter Jirachek dispelled all remaining doubts about the Czechs at the 81st minute.
The 1976 European Championships are sent to the European Championships for the fifth consecutive time.
Luck was also smiled at by Coach Michael Bilek and Legionaires Bundesliga Michael Kadletz (Bayer Leverkuzen) and Thomas Pechart (1st FK Nürnberg) after an error at the outset that could have been catastrophic.
The goalkeeper Peter Chech for the ninth minute, thanks to the instant reflex, prevented the potential car goal of Tomash Sivok.

Although there is now little doubt that the coach of the Gus Hiddink team will now have a seat on the bench, which reached third place in 2002, the Croats are now in the final round of the European Championship for the fourth time.
The Turks almost managed to make a perfect start in front of 31,000 viewers at Maxime Stadium.
Seljuk Inan's long-term strike hit the counter at the seventh minute, and the attacker Kazim failed to pull the ball back to the net.
Croatia then woke up and increasingly took control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in great shape.
The Legioners of Bundesliga Daniel Pranic (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjukić of Wolfsburg, who gave way to Ivan Perišić of Dorthmund at the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni is going to Euro12.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro release after Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattony's team, who already seemed confident in her place after winning the 4-0 victory in the first phase, took the lead for the 32nd minute thanks to Stephen Ward's goal.
Konstantin Vasiliev, of the guest team, straightened the score for 57 minutes.
Ireland took a good pace from the beginning, but only at the 23rd minute did Robbie Keen of Los Angeles make the first clean-up gonal strike.
At the last moment, the Estonian lawyer was able to prevent him from taking Ireland forward.
The goal was full in 32 minutes.
By circumventing Paul Londak's defense, Ward found himself in the right place, and by throwing the ball across the line, he changed the score by 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of workers in China
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double its workforce in China in the next few years.
The Dax Listing Company announced on Thursday that it was going to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) before 2015.
"We will create more opportunities for research and development and hire thousands of people," said Bill McDermott, one of the executive directors of SAP, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
A staff of 2,500 must grow to 4,500.
The world market leader of industrial software plans to double the number of its offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
In this country, which is experiencing an economic boom, there are about 4,000 SAP clients out of more than 176,000 worldwide.

SAP has been present in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to change the scale of our operations," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth based on information in China."
Mass murder - the human dimension
Peter Engleund's intense and very kind new book, "Beauty and Grievance: The Personal History of World War I", begins with a long list of actors whose heart is dying.
Here's a suggestion: carefully cut out this page and use it as a bookmark.
You'll get to know these people very close as Mr. Engleund tells you, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon, at times when, like one of these men and women, you'll get lost on the road and be lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Engleund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he's written now is unusual, he describes it, quite precisely, as "an anti-history job."
It has few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are few ambassadors, clever journalists, or discussions on tactics and military equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, but a book about what it looked like.
The book "Beauty and sorrow" brought together the experiences of 20 more or less invisible men and women from both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people are gonna be heroes.
Someone gets captured, loses his arm or leg, goes crazy or dies.
Their lives are shimmering like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some are lost at that time.
Mr. Engleund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is an amendment to the notion that World War I was only a severe trench war on the West Front.
"Beauty and sorrow" ably provides a panorama of other theatres of war: Alps, Balkans, Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall bee hives; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under pyramids; the unresolved problem is tsetse flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
War covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling like smokeless powder.
When you hear the canonade nearby and you're a woman and you're at home with your children, will you stay or run?
Anyway, who's that coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on and why you have to fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," Mr. Englund notes, "is filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessions, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours".
"Beauty and sorrow" tracks the fate of people like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high seas.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters, and other material already published.
Their lives may be scary or exciting, but they are extremely alive thanks to Mr. Englund ' s small moments and partial details.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with it.
When he tells the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Earzac, everything is Erzac."
"Coffee replacement, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He's still talking about the Earl Food in Germany.
He describes "painted rice made in lamb fat (and decorated with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skin; shoes packed with wood".
It notes that there were "837 registered meat substitutes allowed in the sausage industry, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories speak of honor and courage.
One American sees the most violent urge and says of war: "You feel that at the end of the day this is what men were created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, a evening paper or a bestseller, and to say that this display is civilization and that there is no barbarus hidden under your cuffjacket."
On the contrary, the British soldier notes that he is likely to die and no one will notice or grieve.
"When a person accepts the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think it would happen in front of the public," he writes.
But it's the opposite, it's scary, it's like a "convictioned man being hanged in secret."
Other comments concern old Europe, which is falling apart, and new types of fear.
"The conflict was increasingly becoming an economic competition," says Mr. Angleund, "a war factory."
He notes the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the instillary of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-made costume that causes a massacre at the desk."
People act in an unexpected way: the low level of action is the same as the level of heroism.
Mr. Engleund spoke of soldiers who tried to get venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonorrhea phantoms that soldiers bought and laundered in their genitals in the hope of going to the hospital," he writes.
"The desperate ones were rubbing him in the eye, which often led to life's blindness."
Translated with Swedish Peter Graves, Mr. Engleund's prose is flexible but non-broken, perfectly suitable for his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war "buried completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I were often indirect, such as Paul Fassel's Great War and Modern Memory, or novels such as "On the Western Front without Change" by Erich-Marie Remark, rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Engleund's book is part of this unscathed pantheon.
His book has the most amazing finale I can remember in non-artistic literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he reached out of the book to a page with a list of characters, grabbed it from your hands and set fire to a match.
After the previous mistake, a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers, some wearing protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
The night watch from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zukotti Park was supposed to be the least human in the world at that time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, and the rest were told at first that they were leaving for training.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of the events, and his presence highlighted the importance that the Police Department attached to the operation.
There was no question of repeating such episodes of recent weeks as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which was contrary to the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy for the occupiers.
So after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation began to release Zucotti Park protesters.
The authorities were preparing to observe the occupation taking place in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were conducted on Randalls Island with a track record on Zucotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - bearing in mind Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at the "last minute", a source familiar with the orders that referred only to the assignment as "training".
"The few cops I know who were called into this case weren't told that they were being sent to Zucotti Park," said the man who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zucotti Park were in the highest positions in the department."
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson learned by the city.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated in front of hundreds of protestors who swam in front of the target date and heard about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday was attended by members of various police units, including forces from district police teams, who were usually used to control criminal areas.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like at work, come and leave the park during the day, making 1:00 a.m. the right time for an attack.
"It was the right thing to do when the park was the least crowded," he said.
Rescue vehicles with searchlights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The searchlights and pre-recorded ads, which are out of loudspeakers, seem to have frightened many protesters.
When administrative officers entered the park in their blue winds, many protesters simply packed their belongings and left.
The police reported that the tents did not touch until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to pack.
Other police teams, according to eyewitness accounts, gathered around the perimeter to enter in case arrests were required in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the head of the Police Department, said that it had been done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were prevented from seeing how the police acted and that they were being abused by the police.
Mr. Brown said that cars with television cameras on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could take pictures.
When the police went west through a pile of protestors' personal belongings, including bags, plastic mats and plastic bags full of clothing, the Health Department teams followed her to collect what had been thrown.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside, and pictures of it soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions near the kitchen camp, near the park centre.
Some of them built barricades, and the police went inside and arrested them methodologically.
About 10 people in the camp centre chained themselves together.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Rescue officers were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The cleaning operation was completed in about 75 minutes, reported to the police.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 people had been arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for "disturbing public order and resisting detention", he said.
The most senior officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulasky, the head of the Department's detective police, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "not in charge of the operation", said Mr. Brown.
The second group of policemen was waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case we needed to get inside.
The fences were placed on Courtland Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
The observers saw the police expand the perimeter even further beyond Zucotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, push people even further away.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, released air from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood came out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The school staff union will sue the city for dismissal
A union representing hundreds of school staff members who lost their seats last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students were studying.
The trial is probably the last remedy available to the District Council Union 37 trying to cancel dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, a coordinator for parents and other employees, who were among the most low-paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October as a result of what union leaders described as a political reaction to their refusal to allow the city access to medical funds managed by groups of workers to close a hole in the budget last spring.
City officials categorically denied this accusation.
At a hearing at the City Council last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that the dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One member of the board was agitating, telling him that there was no indication in the budget that school support staff would be dismissed.
The representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had filed a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that an action had been filed against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce a formal filing of a complaint with the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
In the claim, Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department will be named as defendants and eight laid off workers will be listed as plaintiffs, all black or Latin American women, as will most assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city's legal department, said that the city had not seen a lawsuit and was therefore unable to comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the New York Times complaint, the union focused on a number of layoffs in schools in poor parts of the city to support a claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island and there were few in Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 school assistants lost their seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave for District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked at the free secondary school 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the claim states: "These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to make up for budget failures."
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and she also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate additional funding for every poor student who enters school.
The union also claims that the school principals could have been misled by the language of the notification allowing the dismissal of the parents ' coordinators.
The notification used the word "excess", although the word "excess" is more often used when a teacher is moved from the school's payroll to a list of available employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators have been dismissed," says the draft claim, "not just translated."
Mission over, Congress is ready for an agreement on Libya.
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the rebellion in Libya.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, the old dictator Muammar Qaddafi was captured and killed, and American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is due to consider a resolution put forward by President John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) together with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent, Connecticut), who praises the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the American troops for their courage.
"The purpose of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It's a confirmation of the support of both parties for their democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but no discussion on Libya has been easy.
This summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and with the White House about the wording of a series of resolutions endorsing or condemning the role of the American army in NATO missions in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing limited use of American military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of both parties and was never voted on by the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would cut back on the financing of the United States operation in Libya.
It left America's mission in some sort of legislative purgatory -- when Congress is pissed enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so angry that it really gets out of its way.
Then the events overtook the Congress's indecision.
Tripoli surrendered in August to the Libyan rebels, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "glorifies the Libyan people for their incredible courage and extraordinary persistence in the pursuit of freedom" and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also "confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya".
Would the new measures receive the full support of the Foreign Affairs Council or would the legislature be divided like the June bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, the Republican leader of the Committee, opposed the latest version.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, this week the House of Representatives must vote in favour of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a top legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the House of Representatives, Bob Goodlatt (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or on anything else to be put to the plenary vote of the Congress of that Congress.
Other legislators have not yet been able to submit their amendments to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
The Goodlata Amendment is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments affecting a wide range of issues that have been made in this convening.
Some duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were minor variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the House of Representatives and much more about "control over federal expenditure".
Some of them are also identical, but give their authors - mostly newly elected Republicans who want to decorate their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they have "made" such an offer.
The Budget Control Act, which took place in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of the balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some Congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office of Congress members, and House Member José Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to lift the two-term limit for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) has proposed many amendments to guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriages has been proposed for many years, as has another one prohibiting flag burning.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two thirds of the states object to them.
As far as members of Congress were concerned, they were moving as fast as they had done in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments and in the 110th, 66.
This pace is paler than in the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were no more successful than they are now.
The latest amendment, the 27th, was approved in 1992, but was actually introduced into Congress in 1789.
"Battered but not defeated," says Giffords in his first television interview after the assassination attempt.
Ten months after an armed man shot her at a public event in Tucson, a member of the House of Representatives, Gabriel Giffords (democratic party, Arizona) appeared on the federal channel on Monday evening, sang a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun will return" and said she wanted to recover more than to return to Congress.
When Giffords appeared on the 20/20 program, A.B.C. News with Diana Sawyer, she had difficulty formulating proposals and needed help walking.
The program showed her a difficult recovery from a bullet injury that crushed her skull and struck the left side of her brain from the front to the rear of her head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the maximum debt bill.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "hard".
When asked by Sawyer how she felt, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
Interviews with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, were part of an hour-long special issue of 20/20, which was shown on the eve of the new book "Gabby: A History of courage and hope".
The special was about Giffords' recovery after the shooting on January 8.
In a video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she's lying on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teach her how to do simple things.
Nod your head.
Pull out your lips.
And then her first word is, "What."
A few days later, Giffords said the second word, "toast," asking for a change in the breakfast menu.
The video shown by A.B.C. shows that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: we see the congressman singing along with the doctors of "Girls Just Wanted to Fun" Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, she says she doesn't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that he had read an article in the newspaper about the shooting on March 12, when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed.
The suspect, Jard Lee Lafner, is being held in Missouri prison and is being forcibly treated pending trial.
"A lot of people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Tight, hard, hard."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not defeated," said Kelly.
You just got beat up.
And you're gonna get through this, you're gonna get better, and you're gonna come back more than ever.
The troops feel more pity than respect.
The event was a Wall Street holiday that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang ballads about helplessness, disappointment, and loss.
Several hundred soldiers, seafarers, pilots and marines were signaled to line up around him.
The audience in the tuxedo applauded him standing up.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, who was also the then Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted what was best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
The very opposite impression is illustrated by the difficult relationship that has developed between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired American public opinion.
The troops are overrated for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting like they feel sorry for people in uniform.
"We are not the victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who was in command of the troops in Iraq and soon left for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some people to show support is to treat us like the poor."
It's a sensitive topic for military leaders who don't want to look ungrateful or disgruntled with the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger experienced by returning troops in recent years of Vietnam's war has been much worse.
As a result, most talk of pity is quiet and only between combat veterans.
After two of his sons returned from combat in the Marines, a retired colonel, Mark Canns, warned them that people from outside the army would look at their service from two angles.
Some will look at them with admiration, because they fought the rebels and were in exotic places.
Others will wonder if "under the mask is a cruel evil veteran," said Kansna, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high government post in Washington.
While he was looking for a job, he said that he felt that some interviewers had been careful to ask if he would be able to withstand the pressure of responsible work in Washington as soon as the fighting was over.
Canson remembers saying to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to count on a negative effect."
The awkwardness experienced by the military comes in part from America's indifference to war.
Victories in the battlefield are rarely praised by a country that is not familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism the way it used to be in World War II," says the retired Lieutenant General David Barnow, who commanded American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public focuses mainly on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
The troops are estimated by the number of trips they have made, by the number of comrades they have lost, or by the scale of the losses.
The army is facing increasing pressure from anti-rape supporters
This week, historic court hearings must decide whether 28 men and women will be brought against the army on charges of non-reaction to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the next one.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman, 25 years old, and 11 weeks pregnant, she claims, was raped at night by her colleague.
This was in October 2008, when she returned to her barracks at Miramar airfield, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend, and met a male colleague carrying a package of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," Lyman says.
But Texas's family has cleared their fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my instinct."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man approached her from behind, fell and raped, she claims.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will be anxiously awaiting a court decision at a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they brought against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rasmfeld, will go to court.
The claim alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld were unable to cope with widespread violence in the army, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
The suit filed in February by Susan Burke ' s lawyer from Washington, D.C., initially included 17 plaintiffs, but increased to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or threatened with sexual violence by fellow employees and that the army did not properly investigate, prosecute or ensure due process after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeting the top army officers because the problem starts with them.
"Armenia is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Burke also says that since February she has been contacted by some 400 other victims, many of whom may be involved in future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak - she'll open a lot of cases if necessary to keep the pressure.
The defence team from the Ministry of Defence, led by Federal Prosecutor Neil McBride, took steps to dismiss the case.
The judicial documents that Newsweek has received reveal the defence strategy, mainly that former or current soldiers cannot bring claims against the army for damage suffered in the armed forces.
According to the doctrine cited in the 1950 Supreme Court decision of Doctrina Ferez, the Federal Government is not liable for damage caused by persons in military service.
"The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs," says the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially banned from fighting, this division exists only in words: today's wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women ' s soldiers ' teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contacts with local women in the war zone.
Outcome: 150 female soldiers, two thirds of them in combat, died between the two wars.
It's time for the army to become modern, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her claim, three others are prepared.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Law Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academies on charges of promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American War Veterans in Viet Nam is preparing a suit against an army whose focus is the diagnosis of "personal change" by victims of violence in order to suspend them from service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Ana Bhagwati of the human rights group, the Women Military Action Organization.
Her team filed a complaint against the Veterans ' Office in December, accusing him of discriminatory treatment of pension applications from people who claimed to have been at risk of sexual violence while in service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were submitted to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to data from the Ministry ' s Sexual Violence Prevention and Control Service, 3,158 rape attempts were reported.
But as is known, attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this figure is approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examined the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of reported cases had reached trial, twice as many as in the civil justice system.
The complainants in the Burke case refer to their attacks only as the first among other injuries.
In Lyman's case, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell the details of the rape 11 times separately to the police, doctors and commanders.
She collected evidence of the rape, and the assailant's blood - from a cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat in front of a judge at a hearing where she was asked if she had had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive description of the accused, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was gonna give birth - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember my commander saying, "It wasn't a trial against him, it was a trial against me."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a change of identity, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with unfavourable wording, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case put forward by Lyman and her teammates in the suit will move forward is a difficult question, says John Terley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: "In my opinion, they are in a position to move forward."
Between them and the verdict is the doctrine that has been criticized since it came into existence.
I've been critical of Ferez's doctrine my whole life.
The army has fallen behind for decades because it does not have the incentives and constraints that impose responsibility.
He adds, "The odds are very much against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favor, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform is achieved," she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Bravik was an ordinary guy who put his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Bravik, who had confessed to the massacre in Norway in July, which claimed the lives of 77 people, appeared at his first public hearing.
Although Bravik could act alone, he was far from being alone online: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support the right groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy. All you have to do is go on Facebook.
"We realized it was easy to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report on the European cyberpolysis of the British research centre DEMOS.
The personal data on Facebook is so large, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the website's promotional tool to single out the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy - what market scientists have been doing for several years.
Bartlett's team discovered half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then put them in advertising, but instead of showing a new group or diet, the ad offered to the user a survey that asked about their level of education, attitudes to violence and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 participants in 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries without even leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way to do research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not as striking: online right-wing people - most often young males, disgruntled by immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with offline activity are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who are hiding behind the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is only one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends, which are expressed in Lake, posts on the wall, and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three notes a day, Facebook's "super-relevant information" triggers a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the site's title in the title by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it provides an opportunity to study people who cannot be reached on the street with a notebook.
"In the early days, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to join the party and they'd never accept you," Bartlett says.
"Facebook rules out all of this - you're talking to them directly."
Others say that the site could identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of Wisconsin University, Madison, and her colleagues, showed that students who discussed their drunken Facebook activities were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that students' peers, such as their hostel mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often renews drunken status.
"You can't solve the problem without identifying it," reported Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author Moreno and director of the Children's Health, Behaviour and Development Centre at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We found a way to identify at-risk children we wouldn't otherwise find."
Facebook also constantly extracts various kinds of data about its users.
The website ' s Data Processing Unit processed statistics on the status of relations and Valentine ' s Day, the mid-term voter turnout in 2010, and the National Happiness Index (mainly using information only available to them - Cyber Freedom Champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive data collection publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the website watches them whether they like it or not - in exchange for playing Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what happens when Facebook users get involved in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict standards for offline research, online data are publicly available.
"I don't think many users at least thought that a researcher could observe their profiles," says Neil Selwin, a socialologist from the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study he had conducted in 2006 using publicly available Facebook student pages.
"As far as they could imagine, it was just between them and their friends."
Then the question of methodology arises.
Even offline, there's no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
It's impossible to know on Facebook how much information is in the profile and on the user's page.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," Selwin says.
That is why, despite years of work in technology research, Selwin thinks that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools available.
"Nothing can replace going into the real world and communicating with real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social research, and most social research is still offline."
"Frozen and inhumane": Anders Bering Bravik will face public trial for the first time
Anders Bering Breivik, a man who confessed to organizing a double assault that took the lives of 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during the first public appearance in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and Knights of the Templars of Norway," he said in front of the 500 present in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I'll admit to my actions, but I won't admit my guilt."
Judge Torkyel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "didn't want to give Bravik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a written speech, to address the victims ' relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from having access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Bravik in the eyes, others to make sure he was kept under lock and key.
Everyone has come to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," told Norwegian channel NRK one of the survivors on Utoya.
"It was uncomfortable, but it made me feel a little better after I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue Bravik tie, he remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors when he entered and left the building.
Despite Bravik's strange idea that he was part of a large "resistance" movement, the judge ruled that he was not crazy and said that there was no evidence that he had acted with his accomplices.
Some may find comfort in the fact that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But it doesn't automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the entire nation now feels.
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he wasn't," said a relative of one victim.
"It'd be a lot easier if it were."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the theater this week.
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans can think of as the biggest discovery in a recently discovered interview that was remembered in the run-up to the pre-emerging major markets this week is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and he thought he was a hippie, but he was also a thorough organizer and a process master who believed that many business managers suffered from "the pain of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] a great idea from a great product separates a huge amount of skilled work."
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the Triumph Nerd Television series about the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By that time, about 10 years had passed since Jobs was kicked out of Apple, and he was already working for his new computer company, NeXT, in anticipation of massive Internet development.
While a small part of Kringley's interview was used in Nerds, he says the original interviews went missing during transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS was found in the director's garage.
This footage, slightly edited, was the basis for Steve Jobs' 68-minute film: The Lost Interview, which is released on Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred of detailed interviews, Jobs seems unusual here to present his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In four different points during the interview, there are long intervals between questions and answers - reflections on 10 to 15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also moments where Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems annoyed by Kringley's questions, forcing him to move faster to issues or events of greater importance.
In the pre-Pixar era, the iPods and the iPhones of the Lost Interview, there is something sinister prophetic about Jobs assessing what he sees different companies doing right and wrong, and offering their own vision of the future of information technology.
It's one thing to read about the postmortem grades of Jobs' work, but there's something fragile and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, a disturbing dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Shortly after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A little summary of seven significant findings of the lost interview:
About how he learned how to run a business:
"All the time in business, I kept asking, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers you always get are, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks in business very deeply.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his efforts to streamline Apple reporting.
Disturbed by the way of recording costs that often began with "standard costs" that were taken from the ceiling and then brought in by "detailing", he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they could track business expenditures down to the point.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs tells us more about the "blue box" he made with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to hack into a phone company effectively and make long-range calls free of charge.
There's been a lot of writing about the device before, but Jobs' euphoria here, describing the blue box as an act of giving power, is contagious.
He tells us how he and Wozniak tested the box using a telephone machine, ordering a conversation, and then connecting from one AT&T network to the other, until as many stations as possible were connected.
"We've covered the globe half a dozen times, and you've been yelling at the pay phone, and it broke into the nearby pay phone a minute later," says Jobs with a laugh.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could build something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could build a little thing that could control a big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that without it, Apple could ever have appeared.
Jobs continues to describe in detail a famous stunt that he and Wozniak almost handled by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking the Pope for a phone call, trying to copy Henry Kissinger as hard as possible.
When the different members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to an American diplomat, these two began laughing right before the Pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and Bill Hewlett's cold name):
At the age of 12, after hunting for spare parts to assemble the frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a summer job at Hewlett Pacard.
"It had a strong influence on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it formed my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP staff members who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the very first desktop computer".
He was the size of a suitcase, he had a little monitor with an electronic ray tube, and I fell in love with him.
I used to go to HP when I was a teenager, and I was spinning around that car and writing programs for her.
On improvised innovation:
In a few places, Jobs' interview talks about inventing new products on the fly.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of installation boards, one buyer asked him to assemble an entire computer.
Working for only 30 days on credit, he had to plan both the assembly and the delivery of the ready-made devices.
Later in Apple, he recalled the difficulties he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the violent spores... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300], and I was fed up and out, and I found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could raise for $15 that was incredibly reliable.
Big companies losing power:
Long before he took the lead on Apple's recovery, Jobs clearly saw how many industry leaders would be wrong about the situation and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company isn't getting any more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are types of people] who eventually come to the top of companies, and the people who make the product are pushed out of the decision-making arena.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolistic position is being replaced by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
He could be ten times bigger, he could be Microsoft of the '90s...
They were defeated by victory.
Innovation as a form of art:
"A great idea from a great product separates a huge amount of skilled work... when you promote a great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her subtleties.
There are compromises you need to make - some things you can't make electrons, glass, robots, or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head -- these concepts -- connecting them all together...
Ultimately, it comes down to taste -- it's all about trying to express itself in the best way that people have ever done -- and then trying to bring it into what you do.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made McIntosh famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best information technology experts in the world.
If it weren't for information technology, they'd be doing amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are having lunch with the opponents of the health law while the court hears the case.
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether it would listen to President Obama's challenge of the health care law, his two judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, would be honored at a luncheon sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case before the highest court.
The case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petition.
One of the cases on the agenda was a petition supported by 26 states challenging the rapid review of health care adopted by Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists from all over the nation.
The judges had agreed to consider the trial; indeed, a turning debate of 5 1/2 hours was expected in March 2012, and the outcome was likely to be an obstacle to the presidential race, which would be in the midst of the delivery of the judgement.
Paul Clement, who was Deputy Attorney General during George W. Bush's presidency, is likely to be the lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the health care law must be repealed.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft LLC, was one of almost two dozen firms that helped fund the annual Fed dinner, a long-standing group that advocated conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Independent Business Federation.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
Dinner was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court hearing.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, and a known opponent of the Health Care Act, were present.
Honorable guests at dinner?
Nothing new: two judges have been attending the Fed for years.
And that's not against ethical standards at all.
In fact, judges were free of the Code of Conduct, which regulated the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were to obey, they might be covered by Principle 4C of the Code, which states: "The judge may attend the charitable events of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, an honorary guest or be mentioned in the programme of such an event."
However, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to the two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with greater financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethical activists in the government.
"This stunning breach of ethics and indifference to the code contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules as all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the General Court.
"The judges drank and had dinner at an official fund-raising event with lawyers who are currently being tried."
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for this event undermine all allegations of impartiality and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas are hardly paying attention to critics who say they are very willing to mix court cases with groups in business like the Society of Federalists.
And Thomas' wife, Jeannie, is a famous conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives claim that this is an ethical issue for Judge Elena Kagan rather than for Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were raised at the level of the court of first instance.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear this case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan hasn't shown that she's gonna do that.
Boeing gets a record 18-billion aircraft order.
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 wide-fuse ships and is likely to order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, a deal worth over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company gets an order for 50 pieces of its product.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. airliner, and the price of all these 50 planes is $18 billion.
So important is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, the growing gold lives of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, a Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2.520 aircraft worth 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend his largest dollar equivalent purchase order for commercial aircraft, 50 Boeing 777 two-way planes.
An incredible order came from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy 20 more aircraft, which will raise the total price of the schedule to $26 billion, Boeing announced on Avishaw Dubai 2011.
Later Monday, Boeing reported that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which could boast of much better fuel savings and passenger comforts.
The price of six aircraft is more than $1 billion.
"It's really good for Boeing," said the analyst Morningstar Neil Dior.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high."
Oil-producing countries own many Middle East airlines.
Consequently, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but the increase in fuel prices, which is usually damaging to airlines, because this is one of their biggest spending items, is not so destructive because the country earns money at high oil prices.
It's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel the aircraft when prices rise, Diora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The "Emirates" order strengthens Boeing's leadership in the market for large-flozen aircraft and helps to prevent a rival Airbus SAS from interfering with its A350 airliner.
Boeing's victory for the air show took place four months after Airbus announced that he would postpone the biggest A350 debut, which competes with the 777-300ER.
He postponed his debut to increase the axial load after buyers demanded an increase in cargo capacity and range.
Boeing Co. stock grew by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the President of Mexico apparently lost in the Michoacán election.
Louise Maria Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped the opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the election race.
President Felipe Calderón's sister did not seem to have fulfilled her application for Governor Michoacan's position during the violent State elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers had helped drive the race for one of her opponents.
Preliminary results indicate that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP, is the leader of the Western State Governor's race.
"The involvement of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacan but also for the whole country," said Louise Maria Calderón in a radio interview the day after Sunday's vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our employees in the election... they grabbed ballot boxes, put obstacles... and forced people to vote" for the IRP.
The IRP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She's preparing for her return, and winning Michoacán is an important step in this attempt.
The IRP hopes to win the July presidential election.
Valejo seems to have just overstepped Calderon, who led the ratings until election day.
Calderón, a candidate for the National Action Party, or a PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DRP now owned by the Governor's chair, has come third--a major defeat for the divided and failed left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital, Morelia, denied links with drug traffickers and called on other candidates to accept the results.
In Michoacán, drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine dominated for a long time.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still ongoing.
The PND mayor was killed a week before the election when he campaigned for Louise Maria Calderón, and several candidates withdrew from the local election race for fear.
For the IRP, however awful the Michoacán election may look, victory will give the party a driving impulse.
The man who should represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very inspiring for next year."
ADB convinces Asia to help save the eurozone.
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to be willing to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that will stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, director of the ADB office in Manila, said that the two fastest economies should "do what they can" to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries looked at Europe's difficulties "impartially" and said that Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term recession in the global economy.
"It concerns us all."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the Mumbai World Economic Forum.
"Asia may be somewhat protected, but it cannot be invulnerable."
"So if China and India can help, it has to be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italian borrowings have grown dangerously, and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe's emerging debt crisis created fears that it could lead the world economy back to recession, and led to calls from leading emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that any Asian aid would be channelled through IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of EU financial aid bonds, funds to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provided enormous strength in the negotiations to Europe ' s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's Minister of Trade, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a prerequisite, because where we'll find a job for tens of millions of our boys and girls."
Others argue that for emerging economies like India, there is no point in helping rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshni, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically difficult to help Europe for 1.2 billion people in India, of whom about $800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point, they'll find out that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and go to the sea for holidays, and it won't be well received," he said.
Lee Howell, the Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep Greek large and well-paid public sector workers at work in poorly organized, loss-making enterprises such as railways.
Mr. Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatened "significant direct consequences" across Asia.
ADB ' s forecast of a 7.5 per cent growth rate in Asia in 2011/12 is now faced with " capital risks " due to a threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to make "emergency plans" to protect themselves from recession and significant capital outflows from their economies.
The Pentagon's warning of potential cuts in defence spending
Defence Minister Leon Panetta pissed off on Monday in Congress, warning that the anticipated automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already adjusting to a $450 billion reduction in the coming decade, but it is now afraid that additional cuts of 600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress fails to reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The consequences of these cuts will be devastating to the Ministry," said Panetta in a letter to Republicans John McCain, Arizona, and Republican Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress ' s inability to accept the budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequester initiated a 23 per cent overall reduction and the termination of many new projects.
"This intense reduction, which has been so thoughtlessly applied, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or buildings -- and will cause serious damage to other modernization attempts," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We will also have to lay off many of our civilian employees and, since the cut will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to fire the civilian to achieve the goal."
"These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our army and will seriously damage combat readiness."
The cuts would eventually affect the troops, Panetta said.
"Though military funding in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequester, military achievements will be severely affected by a serious disruption in core budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contractual personnel will be reduced to end with the cancellation of contracts and the supervision agreement that supports the troops."
"Staff personnel will be reduced, resulting in late payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated."
Two senators wrote to Panette 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.
"The effect of the sequester in the Department of Defense will be a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We stand firm against this draconian action," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday night when they released Panetta's letter.
"It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we have to impose on ourselves."
"Secvester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it cannot be allowed to happen."
Whether the Pannetta letter or the latest senators' warnings will lead to a fiscal compromise or reinforce calls for Pentagon to be released from cuts, we will see later.
Panetta was completely sincere about the possible cuts, although he came to work in the Pentagon leadership after years of budgetary review in Congress and the White House, and realized that he faced difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a sad picture of what could follow -- troops with shell but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a squad without bullets."
"It's the wing of a plane without enough pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission," said Panetta in his introductory remarks at the Pentagon.
"It's a force that suffers from unstable combat spirit, poor preparedness, and unable to fight potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, he provided further details on how reductions "give rise to significant operational risks: slow down responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be the first to deploy and respond worldwide; and lead to unacceptable risks in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face obstacles, including those that had already been tested, and some only in the early stages of planning.
The list includes a single F35 attacker, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Marines need to replace the Hummer.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say it's a vital next step to improve and confront potential threats from China and other opponents.
How to Catch a Lie
A quick look at the latest headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Kane is busy challenging allegations of sexual harassment by several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The University of Pennsylvania authorities were charged with perjury because they allegedly concealed that a retired football coach had raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was captured when he told US President Barack Obama with the microphone on, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying destroys careers and shakes countries.
Congressman New York and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself in denying his tricks, which was quickly denied by hard evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to harbour extramarital ties.
Again, none of those who lived at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who was accused of lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinski during his second term in office.
Fraud stories in school and college examinations are common.
There have been cases in which teachers have given test answers to their pupils in order to have a good assessment of their performance.
The mentors, who must teach the opposite, send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
For one day, research shows that you can be lied 10 to 200 times.
Now it's assumed that much of this is a lie to save.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
The identification of a lie or the identification of a lie is a skill that everyone needs for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike the room game, which is like, say, charades where you're going to say, "I got you!", finding lies is a serious direction of knowledge based on scientific evidence gathered over the past six decades in prestigious universities involved in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies were divorced.
Liars look into the eyes.
They don't always kick, stutter, blush or fuss.
It is not necessary to conclude that liars are difficult to spot and difficult to expose.
An experienced liar can come to the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the myth, the structure of the questions, and the temporal characteristics.
I have spent several years exploring scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-increasing segment of the knowledge of lies, and it is clear that the detection of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps guide our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel relaxed, managing them with their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the study that extraverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, whereas women lie more about others, usually to protect someone ' s feelings that married people lie less to their partners than unweds (but the lies they say are often insolent).
We also know that if you're perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if anyone's lying?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your object.
It's called a baseline determination.
This helps to provide a starting point for assessing the changes further.
Observe the pose, the laughter, the vocal characteristics of your object.
It would be nice if you knew if a person knocked on his feet all the time in normal condition, then you wouldn't bring unfair accusations when you saw a foot knock in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for groups of delusional verbal and non-verbal actions.
You treat these groups as red flags, not as evidence of deception.
Liars can record the upper part of their bodies when they try to remember their history, they can put their feet in the direction of the door, they can lean out, they can change their pose in a certain way, or they can show "immediateness after an interview" -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change of attitude when all the difficult issues are behind us.
Investigators often falsify the end of the interrogation to just look at the relief after the interview.
So, notice your object's speech.
Scott Peterson is known to have stumbled and used the past time to claim that his murdered wife is alive, which has led to her searching throughout the country.
Vicious people can also use distance in a speech: "I didn't have sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinski" or repeat the complex question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely detectable.
Someone can use "qualification language" when they answer the difficult question, "Good... truth be told... as far as I know... as far as I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than factual, and often red flag.
There's no magical means to detect lies, but you can master the ability to detect deception.
These skills will increase everyone's chances of not being the victim of skilled cheaters in professional and personal life.
The disputed pipeline plan needs to be reviewed after US threat to postpone approval
A few days after Obama ' s administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- causing the anger of trade unions, but calming the environmentalists -- a company planning to build an oil pipeline claims that it would be willing to review the project in order to resume work on it.
TransCanada announced on Monday night that she would remove the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sand Hills in Nebraska and was confident that the project would still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
The spokesman for TransCanada, Alex Purbas, said that the company remained confident that it would eventually receive approval for the pipeline, albeit on another route.
This is happening after the State Department announced last week that it will postpone action on the federal project until it explores possible new routes that do not affect the Nebraska Sand Hills region and the Ogalala Aquifer, a huge underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental assessment commissioned by the State Department is likely to delay the decision until 2013, following the elections next year, although the authorities denied that the decision involved politics.
Obama, in a written statement last week, called the decision an appeal from the Department of State, and expressed his support for it.
The oil pipeline, with a length of 1,700 miles, should extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He's supposed to move 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to the Texas refineries.
To do this, he needs to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loves trade unions that hope for about 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska's anti-plan legislators are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Sand Hills and Ogallala Aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study by the Department of State on environmental impacts showed that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but the source in the energy industry stated that the Department ' s auditor had commissioned a separate review of the review procedure focusing on two issues.
One, whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was the adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
Another is whether the firm that was hired to conduct the initial study was not suitable because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patty Labelle was sued for allegedly causing the baby to be sick from fear.
A family from New York claims that Patty LaBell's disco-diva began to bust into their home lobby in Manhattan, scaring their little daughter to the point where she threw up in fear.
The Tirada of Lady Marmalade scared the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so badly that she suffered "personal change, sleep disorder" and "a strong fear of strangers", says her family before the Manhattan Supreme Court.
This happened on November 10, last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, the kindergarten teacher, Rosanne, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and brought her daughter down to the floor for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to pick her up," she said.
Labelle was angry about the reprimand to a pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and started using swearing -- the word C and the word F, -- on elevated tones...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
Labelle attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her escorts had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, said Rosanna Monk.
The baby cried so much, she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBell a note demanding an apology, but did not receive an answer.
Counsel and representatives of LaBelle are not answering their calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage has not been reported, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he had taken the case free of charge and that the family was planning to make a donation of any money that would be received for charity to children with cancer.
"The goal is to get Patty LaBell to take responsibility for what he did," said Davis.
"This behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to the kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate problems slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López's reign in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market rose, foreign financing declined and the economy was weakened.
The year 2011 will enter Sinaloa ' s economic history as linked to the first year of the government ' s Mario López Valdez, also called the year of change, which has given rise to great hopes for economic development, but, given the adverse climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but there has been a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February not only resulted in losses of millions for the agricultural sector, but they limited the growth potential of the public economy, resulting in a overall decline of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historical fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on the areas affected by the frost provided by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were affected in its entirety and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity led, until November, to a steady increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters there was an accelerated increase in unemployment, between January and March 55.053 inhabitants of Sinaloa were unemployed, with 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the share rose to 5.28 per cent, and between July and September it continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a percentage of more than 74,000 unemployed inhabitants of Sinaloa, an increase of 18,969 over the first half.
Liquidity reduction
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year has been caught by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the rise in unemployment can be attributed indirectly to actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market to limit the resources imposed by the law passed by Congress to combat money-laundering, because it is difficult for people who illegally own dollars to work with them, invest in and use them in something," he said.
Stopped immigration
Lopez Cervantes said that there was also a demographic factor in rising unemployment.
"The number of people leaving the state to find work abroad has been limited in the United States, primarily due to entry difficulties, and in the second, because once they entered, they already face many difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people stays and demands jobs here in the state as a result of rising unemployment rates," he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is getting worse by drawing attention to the large number of violations that prevail in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the active population of the State is employed without being mentioned as employees in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregularity, a further reminder of employment in the State is provided by low wages; in the State, the lowest wages are recorded by the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was up to September 5,352, well below the national average of 7.375 pesos.
Reducing FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate, 2011 recorded the largest outward foreign direct investment inflows in the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July the state ' s FDI amounted to $630,697. This represents a decline of 87.74 per cent over the same period last year, compared with $5,143,312.
For its part, the State Government ' s Ministry of Economic Development recorded only 17.280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which was mainly in service companies.
Debt
Against the backdrop of the economic downturn, the state government requested in July, during the state congress, the approval of a 3 billion pesos loan that would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and no debt benefits were expected until November in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, Mario López Valdez's first year of government demonstrates a lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011, there had been a lack of harmonization of the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The economy's efficiency in Sinaloa this year has been really low, it has to work hard to get back the positions lost this year, we have to redouble our efforts in 2012, we have failed to harmonize the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronic work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
Lopez Loredo said that events such as early freezes had stopped the state economy this year and its efficiency and growth had been limited.
"The low volume of the economy is the result of several events, including the frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy that is not fast enough to generate economic dynamics that allow for acceptable levels of processes, goods and services and thus close it below our expectations at the end of the year," he said.
Revision of direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to continue its most dynamic industrial activity.
"In general, we have discovered that we have been working on it, we believe that a long-term programme must be developed that will re-orient the direction and economic direction of the state, and that all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has to mobilize," he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction in order to better guide the Government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current Administration had demonstrated progress in its own way of conducting public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get involved, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government realizes that much more needs to be done," he said.
He's being sentenced for eight kilos of marijuana.
Five years ' imprisonment and a 100-day fine were imposed on Navolato for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General ' s Office reported that the convicted drug dealer Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who had been convicted of an offence against health, was in this case possession of marijuana for the purpose of distribution.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by the Mexican military during a patrol on the street of Cypruso Valdes, in front of post 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white car pickup in which he carried a black bag in a drawer in a car and a small backpack in a passenger seat, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizures were transferred to the Second District Court and the accused continues to be detained at the Centre for the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Contributions must be made to the work
Public works related to programmes such as Motherland, Rescue of Community Spaces and 3x1 for migrants risked remaining incomplete or long-delayed due to lack of funds, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while work programmes had been developed so far, they were at risk because the state government was unable to make contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes amounted to approximately 50 million pesos, of which the staff should contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for the work, so it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and although the year is over, they didn't give us a penny when they were supposed to give us a piece from the beginning of July," he said, "to keep us busy, we started work and they're very advanced, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not made the contributions it was supposed to make, so at the beginning of the term, the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount which had not been provided in that case by the administration of the State.
"It happened to us in the previous administration because the state had no financial opportunity to participate, and the programs continued to evolve, and this year, to gain access to these programs, we need to find resources to cover what the state owes," he explained.
Although the state authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that the request had been addressed to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts to ensure that the interest related to them would arrive as soon as possible.
"They must contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us a penny."
The Court will approve the digital television transition in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court (SC) rejected the constitutional claims put forward by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which moved the so-called digital television transition from 2021 to 2015, as there were no eight votes required to cancel it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing the actions to move to digital ground television.
As a result, the constitutional claims submitted by the Senate were rejected because there was no qualified majority of the eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree and it remains in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed that the decree should be declared unconstitutional, because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a right established by law for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margaret Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and to support the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to therein concerning the introduction of digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the arguments of the draft in the sense that the federal executive could not determine the general rules for the measures to be prepared by the public administration.
"I also do not believe that, if this had happened, it would have affected the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policy in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is related to the federal executive branch, which has a constitutional mandate, the administration of the State.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years, has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponement of the transition, he said, would mean deferring the benefits of transformation into digital form, which included meeting public needs, which had more than a technical dimension, "because it covered economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he said, "requires the whole system of public economic governance, includes a group of authorities which the Constitution unites into the public executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed digital broadcasting, and he had done so through the executive, despite the existence of highly specialized technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded that the Government, in adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of Congress, ensures administrative compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoacán, the possibility of counting "voting by voice" is being analysed.
According to the PPR, the difference between first and second seats in the Governor ' s elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting 879 votes out of a total of 6.074.
The possibility of counting "voting by vote" is real with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where the difference between the first and second seats in the Governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting 879 votes out of a total of 6.074.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Michoacan Institute for Elections (IMI), Maria de Los Angeles Lianderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electorate had adopted a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacán did not adopt the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Law Act, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in the electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not include its publication within the time frame set out in the law in the State Official Gazette, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJJJJ) ruled on a constitutional claim submitted by the local legislature and called the State representative's vote on constitutional reform "unenforceable and illegal" because he did not have the right to "permit or support them".
In an interview on the possibility of "voting by voice", Maria de los Ángueles Lianderal argued that with the adoption of suitable principles by the General Council of IBM, it would be possible to present a partial or total counting of votes by the local electoral body.
For example, a partial recalculation of one or more ballot boxes may be made on the condition that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of the ballot and counting of documents in the urn or he is not in the Chair ' s custody; or there are obvious errors or corrections to the record.
Moreover, there may be a general recalculation of votes in all ballot boxes when there is evidence that the difference between the alleged winner of the election in question and those who won the second ballot is less than or equal to 1 per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the party and/or coalition that nominated the second candidate.
The total counting of votes will also take place if, at the end of the normal counting, it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate for the second seat is less than or equal to 1 per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate is second in the case of the exclusion of the ballot boxes which have been recorded in the partial recalculation.
It is worth noting that there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the EDP, the difference between the first and second seats is only 0.16%, not even 129 votes out of a total of 923 minutes.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sappalinam, confirmed by the family.
The remains of pilot Felipe Basio Cortes arrived in Saltilo, his hometown on Sunday evening; on Monday, an examination was conducted and a sedative Mass was carried out.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last will was to have his ashes scattered in the Sappalinam Mountains.
Following the acceptance of condolences with other people who died in the disaster, the Basio Cortes family returned to the capital city of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, and the closest people visited the ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel located on the boulevard of Nazario Ortiz Garcia, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he was examined by the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and a football team of which Felipe Basio was a member during his high school studies.
"His wish was to return to Saltilo, and that his ashes be scattered in the mountains of Sappalinam, he always said it to his family and friends," is what Sandra Cortes Basio, the pilot's sister, said.
In her view, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes that he was at the height of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortes Basio, a very young man, left the city of Salcillo to join the College of Aviation in Sapopan, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe him, they said he was dizzy even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltilo, the whole family wanted to welcome him as he brought Martha Saagun to Saltilo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopan for his relative's diploma ceremony, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: driving a plane.
He's on his way out.
Gunshots were fired in honour of the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortes Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres López, people from the village and state government, the Mexican army, the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Salcillo Technological Secondary School, where he studied in 1985 and made progress in both education and sports, and took him on the last way.
Basio Cortes was recently killed when the helicopter he was driving crashed, along with the provincial government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all representatives of that Ministry.
At 18:05 the remains of Basio Cortes, a resident of Saltilo, arrived to be handed over by the funeral home to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major James Martínez, to an esplanade of the training school, where his family was waiting for him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Christine, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned on the NL Kaderate farm
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed 11 people who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in various parts of the body with a test shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Kaderaita Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery was found on the 1.5 km of the Caderayta highway towards Santiago, on the highlands in a commune known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by noticed that the gate had been opened in a village house whose wall was painted beige and brown.
When they looked inside, literally three metres away, they found the bodies of three people, and they immediately gave the authorities the information.
One of the men was wearing a yellow shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and there was another man in a white shirt next to him.
Nearly one metre contained the body of another man, wearing a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three of them lay face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there were no casings on the ground.
There are signs on the fence of the village house addressed to one organized criminal group of another, and there are several bullet holes in it and in the gate.
11 caught in Kadereit
The Ministry of National Security represented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Kaderate and who were accused of kidnapping, murder, fraud and secret graves.
According to published information, eight persons were initially detained in Los Alvero Colony on 11 November and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, demanding to become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event took place on 12 November at 06:00 a.m., when military personnel made a patrol round in the village of Old Rancho in Kadereit when they saw a car with no license plates with two men in the salon.
After stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a ammo and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, after these statements, at 1400 hours on 13 November, one of their accomplices was stopped on public land in La Prada, who, after seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is charged with secret graves in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Kaderate.
A new Italian Government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monty, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face the crisis that has brought this country to the brink of an economic disaster.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present a new government that will face a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the Presidential Palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form a government.
He was expected to present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it was not clear when the new executive body would take office.
Monty said that he would present to the President the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country's ability to emerge from this difficult period," said the former European Commissioner to reporters.
Monty did not say explicitly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is well defined now," he said.
Monty completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, which is much less than usual, because Italy was struggling with a political and financial crisis that brought their debt to a critical level.
The Administration, under the leadership of former European Commissioner Monty, must approve the austerity package required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
Based on the pressure on Monty to hurry, unstable markets set the income from Italy's BTP bonds at over 7% for 10 years, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be rescued.
Emma Marchaglia, the leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after a meeting with Monty, "We said we would actively support this government."
We believe that this Government is Italy ' s last chance to emerge from this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said reporters Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centrist-right party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the government majority of technocrats that form Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Monty Government must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be not popular reforms of austerity.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks increased pressure to warn that Monty's failure could be a disaster.
Monty began consultations on Monday with political parties, alliances and business groups, as well as youth and women ' s organizations.
He's gonna finish his meetings on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday of Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italy's debt now reached a critical level, against the backdrop of uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would succeed.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for the eurozone's modern financial defenders.
Monty said that his Government would be in place until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite popular forecasts that politicians would only allow him time to undertake reforms before the new elections were scheduled.
Monty said that he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that he should be made up of only technical specialists, demonstrating their dissatisfaction with the financial situation affecting the process.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and opposition by the parties made the attempt to include political figures more difficult.
Spaniards have more game experience than Ticos.
Of the 22 players announced in Spain, 10 had already played 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 players declared played 50 games.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica, compared to the 22 players who were called by both countries to a friendly match at 3:05 p.m. today at the National Stadium in San José.
While World and European champions, number one on FIFA's monthly rating, have a complete list of class A spot games, Tricolor only has a defender, Michael Umana, as the only one who has played 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernandez Stadium.
Spanish football players playing in the League of All Stars and in the strong clubs of the Prime League of England were very active in the league and in the local cup competitions during the year, and they are high-level players in the European Cup and the League of Champions.
It is worth adding the experience of Spanish Fury in complex qualifications at the Euro or World Cup.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone such as CONCASAF, which is considered to be the lowest in FIFA.
We see that he is leading the list of the Spanish Golkyper, Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (the game lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of the ex-Golquiper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Tricolor today and set a new record in 127 international games for Spain.
Javi Hernandez, Barcelona player, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Javi were recognized as the best UEFA team player last week, along with another Iberian player, Subisarret, with 126 matches and bomber Shalke Raúl González with 102.
Nearly a hundred Carles Pujols with 97 games.
Javi Alonso follows them from 91, Fernando Torres from 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both from 81, Andrés Inesta from 62, Sesk Fabregas from 61 and David Silva from 53.
On the side of Costa Rica, next to Michael Umana, the left side Hunior Diaz with 48 matches and the bomber Brian Ruiz with 45.
Further, only five have crossed 30 games: Kaylor Navas from 31, Randall Asofeife from 32, Michael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Hernández from 36 and José Luis López from 35.
The rest.
More than 30 games in Spain were played by Gérard Pique (37), Cergio Buscets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiola (31).
==Career==The team has Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Muri with 23.
The rest didn't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games, and Hordi Alba has two games, in Costa Rica, Victor Bolívar has only one, and Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet made their debut.
Spain's lead player, David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres from 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one who scored more points, twice that of Carlos Hernández and three times that of Roy Muri and Parks.
Quintet included the country on the 20th anniversary tour.
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true.'
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bass player Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band was ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the group says that for them it is also a dream that has become a reality - to play in this country.
It was the statement of the bassist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is in South America as part of a 20-year tour and on Sunday, 20th, will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., together with a team from Los Angeles The X and a local group from Las Robertas.
It's an extract from a conversation that's completely deciphered online at The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans, it's a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and so far it's going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're very happy to bring our music there.
I'm asking because there's some loyalty to the group; fans live under stress the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat him like the biggest show of the year.
Does that add to any tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played in the past 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We've had some great shows in San Paulo, and we hope that this has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, with regard to these two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as Mexico, these are great places for surfing, that's how we learned about it, from people who like surfing.
As you look at the tour, you've made a huge show with a lot of songs.
What are you planning to do in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we have no limits on what we can do.
We'll try to make the best show possible with a variety of songs; we'll try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a great variety of repertoires.
You never repeat a repertoire.
How do you do that?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in the tone and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we could forget.
That makes the show more interesting to us, and so I think it makes it more interesting to people.
You're celebrating 20 years of career on this tour.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yeah, definitely.
First of all, I think none of us could ever imagine that we would be in a rock band and that we've been doing this for more than 20 years making it like a dream.
We rejoice in our luck, and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we love making music.
We're happy to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
Things are going very well for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the granger's bloom?
It's always been an honor to be part of this group of great collectives.
We're good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney, and Alice in Chase.
It's nice to see the movement grow out of a group of friends, and it's unusual.
From time to time, one group from the same city appears, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We're proud and honored to be part of a group from Seattle.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them and we're honored to be part of Seattle's sound that came out.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together and in the same composition for so long.
Yeah, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups exist.
First of all, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second of all, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, music roads have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't have been better.
Your attitude to the word of glory was difficult; but thanks to your success, you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find the balance?
When we grew up, it made it easier to find a balance.
We care not to be on tour too long, because it's easy to get into this game with a big crowd and people who love your music.
As long as you remember people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what made it, without deciding to be famous and rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs and it was great at the beginning.
We've been a band for almost three years, and we haven't released a single album until Andy's death.
There were many disappointments, because it took so long, and the most important thing is that we're still close friends with Bruce and Greg who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or a picture, I think about the incredible man Andy was, and how he made me laugh, it's always been a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and a lot of other things.
He was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that's why you chose her to open it?
Yeah, the producers sent us some video offers, and it was a group that we liked most, so we're excited to see that Las Robertas can offer live, and it must be very exciting.
Why do you always change the words at Yellow Ledbetter's concerts?
That's a question for Eddie Wedder, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he's using the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
There's so many of them.
First to come to mind, Geezer Butler, John Antvisl, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovsky...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the granj's relevance, even though it's no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel some distance from the word grunge.
When I think about him, he reminds me of the bands that I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone that came along at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful, because it's music worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoney are making music now better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are a few songs in the album that may seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Brethe, which are considered very dark, although they may sound a little positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, those songs were very dark.
I think that when you grow up and there was some trauma in your life and you lost a family member or a friend, these events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical examination.
Ex-President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at the public hospital, and his family doctor informed him of the loss of muscle force observed in his legs.
Fujimori, 72 years old, sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from a number of diseases, including language cancer, which has led to him being operated four times and under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told television channel N that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of power in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that he believed that Fujimori should be a candidate for humanitarian pardon; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He had four surgeryes for language cancer, lost 18 kilos in weight, with other diseases, such as severe erosion gastrite, pancreas cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and leg circulation problems, listed by the doctor.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the Police National Directorate of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years ' imprisonment for the murder of 25 people by forces of the army ' s destruction squad, which operated in secret during the first years of his reign.
Mujica is going to Mexico to strengthen political ties.
An official delegation led by President José Muhica of Uruguay, composed of several ministers and businessmen, will come to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderón, the most important item in the extensive plan of meetings with political and commercial authorities and with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by Uruguay's leadership.
The meeting of the two Presidents in Guadalahara will be "friendly for the exchange of information on political relations between the two nations", as published by the South American leadership on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking the support of Calderón for Uruguay in an incident with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a tax list at a G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remained tax havens, a statement that had provoked Uruguay ' s protest and withdrawal for consultations by his Ambassador in a European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group established from the most developed and developing countries, and has in fact had an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has tried in recent years to expedite the conclusion of tax exchange agreements in order to leave the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's "grey list" of countries that do not enjoy international standards for tax cooperation.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which had increased trade between the two countries.
The mustard plumber will be three-dimensional with Super Mario 3D Land.
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil paws of Bowser, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land, he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will appear in shops around the world this month, has been designed to take into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows three dimensions to be played without the need to use glasses.
"Mario, the hero who has to tell us how stereoscopy without glasses will work," said the head of the Nintendo Press Service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the Madrid launch.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game specially designed under this platform", because until now successful products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Oscar of Time 3D" have been adapted to existing games.
Nintendo stated that, despite the existence in 3D, Super Mario 3D Land was an "accessible" video game that allowed for a quick and moving game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
One day, most experts will go "second-round" to game levels that are more complex this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D Aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of action, but on which three dimensions are needed to overcome various obstacles and "do not yield to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional invasion of Super Mario also marks the return of the hero to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winks to fans of the show and repeats the successful formula from previous games, a plumber with a mustache needs to walk through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new moves, decorations, costumes, and enemies, as well as Luigi's "playing" game.
Colom guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process, Alfonso Portillo, had begun to answer in the United States for a $70 million conspiracy to launder money.
This concludes the process by which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which requested the extradition of Portillo to be tried there.
At the press conference, Kolom said that his decision was linked to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, given that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he had not "handed" the legal decisions and had adopted all the extradition procedures he had ever known.
Together with Portillo Sergio Ruano Marroquen will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, along with Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What had been done by Kolom showed the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts had been exhausted to prosecute the former Head of State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court, Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and the guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found not guilty of wasting Q120 million at the Ministry of Defence during his presidential term, which was a process prior to extradition, but the Ministry of Public Affairs appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 youth at risk
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove's social support organization are important: 6,000 young people who are vulnerable to social exclusion have helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter century.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs have been created for this social group.
The anniversary was an occasion for the outcome of a ceremony held at the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove was born near Trinity Velya in 1986 to help young people with education, unemployment, and drug problems, or vulnerable to marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration at Santa Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that collaborated with the association during those 25 years.
The different political representation during the election revealed the unified nature of the work done by Trinijove.
After the President of the General, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Hordi Puhol, the ex-advisor of the Socialist entity, Ernest Maraghal, and the former Lieutenant of the Mayor and current eco-socialist, a member of the municipal council, Ricardo Goma, attended the ceremony.
The current consultant on social welfare and the family, Josep Lewis Clerice, and SEO on social work, La Caixa, Homer Lanaspa, also appeared in Fabra I Coats.
He said that Trinijove had come into being at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The President cited Trinijove as an example of the struggle against bad circumstances and hope in people in difficulty.
"Crisis is not new to the organization and work that she did," he said.
Captured building where mass parties were organized, evacuated
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the Balmes Street building, 51
12 occupying forces left the building yesterday at noon without fighting.
It seems that the nightmare experienced by neighbors living in a house 51 on Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building at noon yesterday, which they illegally occupied, and where they organized mass parties that annoyed neighbours by court order without police intervention.
When the operation was over, the lock on the doors was changed to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, there's gonna be traffic control," said the manager.
The squatters that took 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest of them settled, took all the electricity and part of the water, painted the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially liquor cans.
The first three floors were a public party site that lasted for up to two days and annoyed the owners.
Right behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that her income had fallen by 80 per cent since the building was occupied.
The owner of the club says that the invaders of the building dragged her into an unfair competition because they sold drinks for three euros, whereas they sold drinks at the club for ten.
Moreover, the owner of the discotheque was to respond to the noise complaints of the neighbors, although she observed that the noise was not caused by the visitors to the club but by the residents of the squatter and, above all, by those who attended the parties that were there, whose frequency and intensity had increased, as the angry neighbors said.
The owner of the club said that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months now he has "forgave" her rent.
City police also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PPP municipal group, Adviser Alberto Fernand Díaz, demanded last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to address the problems of coexistence and shared spirit of neighbours and degradation in this area".
A popular leader explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before summer, but in the last few months the squatters had invaded all floors and almost every room, and that some of them had been broken into.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to stand firm against the culture of the building".
So yesterday, the police evacuated the building to Noo Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., the police went to Montral Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of a competitive bidding process after bidding on contributions.
The municipal contest on 16 doors resumed the debate on the role of Kolserol in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, on the rise of the now-dead Barcelona Capital Corporation (SCB), this administration printed promo strips for Kolserola.
The bouquet described the mountain as a large park in Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison in the pictures with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CSC, in 1987 the park returned to the consciousness of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that is oriented up (mountain) and not north-south.
Positioning Kolserola as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as Yoga's bear.
That was until, in September, the council announced a huge competition consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates in Kolserol.
The gates mean the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put a gate on the field.
The question is, "Colserola, park or mountain?"
The competitions, their organizational side and their impact on the city, are the subject of discussion for all the architects of Barcelona.
This is almost the most repeated topic discussed when two members of this chosen people's clan recognize each other in the elevator.
And that fact leads to just one of the few coincidences between what the three architects of Barcelona say and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Byon: The competition is appropriate
For Roldan, once the coastline is reached, it becomes necessary to discuss "the front side of the mountain" when the offer of Ildephon Serda, a mountain with green apples, has not been implemented.
"We have to assume that Barcelona's biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, its excellent accessibility.
Colserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Kolserola Gate" contains a "word trap": we must not think of them as "as entering the park, but as limiting some areas where we must act."
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayon with experience in urban construction, called the proposal "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Risks arising from the "uncertainties in public space forecasting" following the 1980s experience that ended at the Forum's "his swan song".
The first fear is the very limitation of the boundaries where you can build.
"The limitation of something is the preparation of the next step", meaning the transition.
"We have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [as far as the capital master plan (GSP) is concerned] may lead to a real disaster."
Closer to the point, Modolo believes that simplifying the Kolserola Valley "may be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topography question.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside Calserola that "shouldn't be missed," although he is grateful for the opportunity offered by the mayor's office to join the project "from the beginning".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is the one that should lead multidisciplinary teams ("achieve", he claims), which should have created: "The architects should only be an instrument".
Byon suggests that the answer to the question that asks the title of this part is complex, because the competition rules lack a general type of Kolserola: "There were 16 overlapping competitions announced," he says, "in the sense of seamount, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the area as a whole."
This makes him, at least in his case, choose to compete for 16 contests.
On the other hand, a project for one gate may overlap by program and definition with a project for an architect for a nearby gate.
From your point of view, the council should guarantee that the stripe directly above Rhonda de Dalt should provide an area in its entirety equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasabel and he will be released.
After 72 days of settlement, the judicial representative of Red Casino forgave the brother of Mayor Monterrey in a lawsuit against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrabal will be free after the legal representative of Red Casino has granted him forgiveness before the Second Criminal District Court, which is in the process of extortion against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonas demanded payment of an economic contribution from him, so that the Monterrey authorities would allow a secret operation in the gambling house.
Following a public conviction, the State Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor ' s brother and, on 2 September, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old capital of the State.
He remained at the site for 49 days, following the requirements of the second restraining order after the prosecutor had ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kadereita, allegedly for extortion of half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours there in a prison with an average degree of isolation, because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving in San Nicholas municipal prison in Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest order was issued by the Registrar of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that after almost two months of investigations, it was quite obvious that Jonas had been guilty, such as charging 1.5 million pesos from bookies in exchange for permission to operate.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to seek pardons for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could be released in the next few hours.
During the trial, the public prosecutor of the court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether he had compensated for the damage and which partner of the gambling house granted pardons, although the lawyer had tried not to give a name.
Based on the recording of 197/2011, a legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrabal, and no further statements could be made about the process that had been planned against him; nor would any compensation and punishment be required.
Following a hearing by the legal representative of the bookies, at almost 3:50 p.m., the immediate release of Larrasabal Breton was ordered.
The courtman, Jorge Janes, went to San Nicholas prison in Garza to inform Yonach that he was legally forgiven and that his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionicio Pérez Hacoma describes the details of the disaster where the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, died, and seven others died.
The Minister of Communications and Transport (MOT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others were killed, showed that the helicopter hit the ground directly in full integrity, without the pilot attempting to make an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionycio Pérez Hacome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot found that weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"Elements that seem to indicate that the ship had several contacts with the ground, wings came into contact with trees at 25 metres, where the vehicle lost its fluids."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, in accordance with the necessary requirements for the carriage of persons.
He also said that studies conducted in the area of impact did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
"The study states that there are no ship components elsewhere, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which satisfied the relevant requirements for the transport of passengers.
The earth in this place has a slope of between seven and 30 degrees.
At this point, the secretary said, the most important thing is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study may take months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the attack, the President's helicopter was operating at cruise speed and that it had happened on soft, rising soil.
"This information reinforces the theory of a normal flight manoeuvre at the moment of impact," he said.
At a press conference, the owner of SCT, Perez Hacome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aviation regulations, the flight was conducted according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must have visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
AICM reports identified suitable conditions for take-off when the aircraft proceeded to the border between Mexico City and the Mexican State, where layers of clouds were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It's possible that because of cloud conditions, the team was looking for a lower height and greater visibility in the Cuernawak Valley.
Place of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last recording from the aircraft's radar are likely not to have lost control or changed direction before the impact.
Fracture of debris in a small area:
The information still available indicates that the impact occurred on the front and side lines.
The debris indicates that the helicopter encountered the ground in structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion were found:
In the disaster zone, there remains undetected evidence in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent studies show that there may have been multiple contacts with the land.
During the on-site work, pieces of aircraft were found at a height of 2,900 feet above sea level, and the land has a gradient from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had several clashes with the ground.
After a thorough investigation, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found in a larger area than the designated area near the crash site, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces a program to search for the obesity gene.
Social protection leads research on the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) announced that it was conducting a study to detect obesity in children and young people, known as the "Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescent" protocol, which would provide a calculation of the signs of excess weight.
In his statement, Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Biochemistry Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the Twenty-first Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been assembled.
The team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Health (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (written or not) is invited to participate by going to the MSSI sports centres participating in the study to the Mexico Valley, where children will be tested every Saturday morning from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to be held at the Cuautemoque Sports Centre (in the western part of Mexico State) and that since 8 October the events had been held at the Nesaulcoyotla Sports Centre (East of Mexico State).
Once the target of 500 to 600 children has been achieved, the study will continue at the Sports Centre of Independence (South Mexico) and finally at the Sports Centre of Morelos (north of Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of the study was to understand the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
The World Diabetes Day will be observed on 14 November and the main goal is to collect 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 with parental permission and under their supervision to complete individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family inherited diseases in order to avoid the risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometric measurements would be made of all participants (weight, growth and throttle), blood pressure and levels of glucose, fats, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight among children.
Medical studies carried out between 1999 and 2006 indicated that there had been an increase in only six years: 77 per cent of boys were obese, 47 per cent of girls; there had also been a significant increase in weight", MSSI said.
He said that the rationale for finding markers was based on the fact that the country's population differed from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexicans were 65 per cent descendants of American Indians, 30 per cent descendants of Europeans and five per cent descendants of Africans, a condition that affected genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that the main effect of obesity genetics is the inability of the body to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and it is delayed in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the immediate benefit to participants was a comprehensive assessment of children, which could determine whether they had any excess weight or obesity.
Even he said having dark folds on his neck and forearm means that metabolism and even prediabeth are likely to be disturbed.
The information is treated confidentially, and the doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and changes in lifestyle that must be made in order to avoid disease.
Cruz López explained that there were three main reasons for excess weight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary lifestyles, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day in front of the television, and using transport at small distances instead of walking.
This is also due to high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (thame, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high levels of fat and protein and the genetic predisposition analysed in this programme.
UNAM asphalt can avoid cracks
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best environmental and temperature-resistant quality.
If the road surface signals were to be addressed, it would be necessary to repair some 200,000 pits in each rainy season in the capital area of Mexico City, says Rafael Herrera Nahera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemicals, and adds that if the construction and maintenance of the paved road surface are correct, the number of pits can be reduced or reduced to zero.
His lecture on the technological view of pits, read in the context of the International Year of Chemistry, reported that the laboratory for which he was responsible was developing a polymer-modified bitumen for the production of a mixture with the characteristics close to the bitumen, but with the best resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and thus to resist the formation of pits.
He explained that the bitumen, the hardest part of oil, was a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some of them a high molecular mass called asphaltens, and others a low molecular mass called maltens, which together gave road cover to its characteristic viscous behavior.
The viscosity behavior of the bitumen is the fact that he behaves like a liquid in high Tepmeratures of about 180 degrees, with 120 degrees of viscosity very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius, he keeps his condition almost firm, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that resistance to street asphalt is not permanent, but changes during the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, the chemical engineer said.
The scientist noted that the streets of Mexico City were mostly covered with a flexible cover composed of six layers of material, the last three of which included bitumen.
Among the uppermost layers is a bitumen made of small stones dropped into the bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that makes this coating, he said, is trapped in a bitumen.
When vehicles are driven and effort is exerted, this helps the forces to be very well distributed across the road surface.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would have been even better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt surface, he added, the last layer, which is called a layer of wear, which is made of a small stone, which is actually sand, also loaded into asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will be in contact with the wheels of transport, it must have more resistance than asphalt coating and provide friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and disseminate these forces, the wear layer also requires adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature variations, were also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it had a significant impact on asphalt.
When the land is raw, the water enters the surface and it is difficult to get out of it, it causes all layers of the surface to soften and therefore the pits to form.
When the pits are formed, he said, the first wear-on layer is worn out and only then it affects the bitumen, but the damage does not occur instantaneously, which should be addressed in the first signs of the maintenance programmes.
Also, a member of the National Research System explained that the transport load was another important factor in creating holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of coating should always be linked to the load and should be guaranteed in order to prevent the frequent appearance of pits.
Rafael Herrera said that relative bitumen still has a lot to study and do, for example, bitumen emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and even help fix holes with ease and without using high temperatures.
What wasn't enough Vale's candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the reasons that prevented Serena Melina Ramirez from obtaining the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle's representative won the princess title 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca has only one wish to have the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna was to be content with being on the podium with a silver crown and ribbon declaring her the new princess of Colombia.
Based on the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlanta won the crown and the scepter, the department has 14 named princess, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown but were declared princess, including Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingez (1949), Patricia Belini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Layla Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonsuela Pinedo (1990), Diane Ichabel Romero (1993), Hiseye Alcure Garces (2000), Catalina Hiraldo (2007), Stephanie García Alhure (2008).
The question that many people are now asking is:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favourite who, in each of the speeches, showed that she had everything to do to become the new Miss Colombia, she was not simply elected Queen of the Police and the most beautiful person in Vogue, the titles that the Queens possessed, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who were given the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the First Princess title was that she was unable to answer the question, "What book characterizes you and why?", as asked by Martin Murilla Gomez of the literary society, let's read.
She answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I definitely think that the book characterizing my childhood, Little Prince, is quite a deep book.
Today I'm reading Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read, and now I'm reading Irina Nemirovsky's book, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called Blood Fever.
An answer that the jury did not like because of the term "cultivation" and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the books quoted characterized it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said that she was calm and happy with her result: "The universe is wise, what must happen."
And you all, please read a little, Little Prince is a great book."
Among the hypotheses spoken, Vale was burned by favouritism.
A Bogota reporter suggested that, since she was preferred, she was ovated, and she was a candidate who received all the pre-reward awards (Ostera's chicken competition, an spectator's vote for the best national costume, and Queen Mother), "which aroused the jealousy of other candidates, caused stress in the Queen, and as a result she did not shine on the stage."
And it was marked during her first appearance in a bathing suit on Hilton Beach and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was evident that she lacked the strength and energy that Magdalena and Atlántico demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was called a princess " means that a candidate who wins more awards during the competition does not become a queen."
Moreover, the representative of Valle had recently avoided contact with the press, and that had been wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Vale's representative failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why two days before the selection, Lucy Doty, a member of the international jury, said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we must look not only at appearances, but also focus on public consciousness before they take part in the competition, they should already be involved in projects," she said.
It is also assumed that the Vale representative has committed defects on her buttocks and fibrosis, which was visible on her stomach, but this is controversial, as the jury highlighted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen Jorge Hernan Orosco's consultant notes that Melina didn't have a better body than she did, "but the problems of fibrosis on my stomach, which I didn't see very well, made her lose her glasses on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistake of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she was subjected to surgical intervention.
"Operations are good, but Ms. Valle doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize that was first awarded by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, the brutal prediction came true last night, it is said that it was the uncle Raimundo gave to Melina as compensation for losing her pleasure in getting the crown.
Whether it is or not, the fact that Melina is now in the year of rule, not as queen, but as princess, is the position that enables her to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions announced directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
That was the work of the man who identified Alfonso Cano's body.
The Cali forensics guy came into history as a man who confirmed Alfonso Cano's death.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, CTI Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of FARC head Alfonso Kano by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI criminologists, Elizare González, a person from Puerto Tehada, who had spent 21 years in the area of judicial investigation, was on call this week.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to travel more than five days through the jungle to reach the location of the bodies to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and, after completing his courses, became a forensic specialist, where he studied skin friction, i.e. palms and studs.
During the week of Elizara's identification operation for a man known as Alfonso Kano, he was told to take his clothes for no more than three days.
Something great was coming.
On Friday night, he arrived by helicopter from Cauca to Palmira.
He knew that he would have to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten prints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was located, he did not identify him by appearance; he was very different from the media.
He had no beard, dressed like a local farmer, no glasses, and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
By using an enlarged glass, ink, scapula, and torch, Elizar compared the body's fingerprints to those that were in the photos.
His eyes didn't fail: it was Alfonso Kano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Texas was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinson, that he was the head of the FARC.
Fingerprint Search
For the Dactiloscopy specialist of the Sijin unit in Cali, the confession obtained from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar González at a press conference about the operation against Kano is particularly significant.
A lot of people don't know our jobs.
Dactiloscopy is a strict science, without mistakes, it can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to the identification of the bodies, fingerprint specialists are involved in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder and identify the detainees.
Many offenders have forged or undocumented documents when detained.
We're taking their prints and we're looking for them in the database.
The researcher said that in the case of theft, he had to take a piece of the wall of the house because the thief was sticking his hands in this place to take possession of a safe full of jewels and money.
"The walls are hard to work with because they are not convenient surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we can take a picture of the entire palm and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts," he states.
Fingerprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
Recently, a dead man with bottles of liquor around him was found.
During the investigation, it was established that a relative might have been suspected of having committed the crime and that the fingerprints on the bottle were in fact consistent.
Although it doesn't guarantee he was a murderer, it proves he was at the murder scene.
The CTI fingerprint specialist explained that a chemical or physical reagent was being applied to print sites.
When they appear, a shoulder or ribbon is used to remove them.
Fingerprints are then sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or entered into the register.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said expert CTI.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not everything you touch leaves a fingerprint on it.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
"The angry people" are challenging the authorities of New York.
Hundreds of protesters have camped in front of Zukcotti Square.
Some of the protesters heard the court's decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and went to the park next door.
On Tuesday, the members of the Capture Wall Street movement challenged the authorities of New York City when they tried to break into Manhattan Square again under a court order, from where they were evacuated at dawn while attempting to seize another Grand Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered near Zucotti Square, where they wanted to get to, thanks to a court order that allowed "frozen people" to camp in the square, while another part of the movement responded to the race by taking over a park in the north of the city where further arrests were made.
"Our idea is that since the court won't allow us to make camp in the square, we will make camp elsewhere and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zucotti and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations," said one of the members of the Wall Street Movement, Mark Bray.
Brei explained that the response of the "hungry people" to the evacuation of the tent town ordered personally by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, had gone to the court, where Judge Lucy Billings had issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the angry people began to seize a new park located at the site of the central street merger of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue near the entrance to the Holland tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey and the parish of the Trinity Church.
At least an hour they could have taken the place, but then the police arrived and started arresting some of the protesters, although Bray could not give the exact number, but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures us that several hundred people were standing with tents in the place where a delegation of religious leaders went to show support to the members of the movement in an attempt to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zucotti Square, which is private property, remains closed pending the hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, which will consider the legality of this morning ' s dispersing of protesters.
Some of the protesters who were on their way there carried and distributed copies of the judgement and even gave them to the police officers guarding the square, which led to "some small clashes", said Bray, who stated that some police officers had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Seize Wall Street movement and from forcing the enforcement of "laws that were issued after the seizure began, or from prohibiting demonstrators from re-entering the park with stores and other property used previously".
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of the court order, the city had suspended the opening of public space and the demonstrators had been informed of it, but the local laws prevented them from opening tents and sleeping bags again.
The municipal councillor personally justified the removal of protesters from Zucotti Square at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made, and the decision was taken because the protesters were "in violation of the law".
Bloomberg said that he ordered the area to be cleared because it became "a place where people came not to protest, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others", because "some businesses received threats" and neighbors feared "the deterioration of the quality of life".
The evacuation this morning was disgusting and shows that deep down Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers," added a representative of the movement who condemns the mayor for "disrespect for freedom of expression".
The owners of the Wall Street Capture also indicated that they intended to organize "grande" events on Thursday, in cooperation with social organizations and trade unions, to recall the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show.
Together with Michael Buble and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on the December 1 television program "Russell Peters Christmas".
Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant at Big Repair, a lifeguard at Malibu Rescue, Bunny at Playboy, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
Private TV CTV announced today that Anderson, along with Kruner (ballad performer), Michael Buble and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the December 1st "Russell Peters Christmas" television program, as a very special Mary.
CTV introduced today the footage of a television show in which Anderson, also known as the Internet-based home-based pornographic video, appeared with her then husband, Tommy Lee, drummer of Mötley Crüe, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary, with a doll depicting Jesus in the crèches.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently took the lead in the tour "My Rough Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Shin, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a Canadian singer, Buble, who married the Argentine model of Luisiana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March and who also knows the scandal.
Buble recently called "bitch" American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan reborn after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and put an end to the decline that began in March.
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from a devastating earthquake, which has led to a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster experienced by the rising sun country since the Second World War.
The Tokyo government's first estimate of material losses was $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult situation in the world, seems to be passing.
After three consecutive failed quarters, gross domestic product data from July to September clearly helped to turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 per cent annually.
Registered in the second quarter - Japan ' s fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be attributed in part to the revival of the purchase of machine equipment for the rehabilitation of areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami that followed.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against a 0.9 per cent reduction in capital expenditure from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true shift in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian momentum, which calls for the crisis to be used to strengthen - or restructure - infrastructure, using holes to grow from scratch.
Japan has been awakened, mainly by household consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This figure has increased by 1 per cent as a result of the increase in the cost of cars, travel and recreation.
The branding of the yen
Tokyo provided the domestic market when the yen, the Japanese currency, became one of the "exchange shelters" chosen by investors who want to get rid of the euro zone debt crisis and the negative US forecasts, a privilege that pushes like a rock into the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for their low rates from July to September.
As long as markets continue to be besieged by the EU's peripheral countries, the Government of Esikhiko Noda does not diminish vigilance.
We must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the dramatic rise in the value of the yen, said the Minister of Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa, yesterday.
Indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries had shown clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator that predicts the world economy's fractures has shown that the main forces are slowing down.
It then fell by four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average of 100 points after it hit eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athenas are giving rise to doubt again.
Papadimos said the adjustment would be approved, but the conservatives would not sign any written commitments.
With peripheral premiums for risk and uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues to wander the labyrinth that leads to a solution to the large European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consent" of Ella's new transitional government is imposed by Brussels's demands rather than by the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment might not be sufficient for their application, the leader of the conservative New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaramas, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any way and reiterated his demand for the new elections scheduled for 19 February.
The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, said Papadimos yesterday, opening the parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform the disciplinary code for public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras' message does not shed any light on his position: "We are willing to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing."
Conservative leader did one step more in his mood for the EU and the IMF, the organizations that would unfreeze the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needed, and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter of agreement to the treaty.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effect of the Papandreu referendum's claims, repeated yesterday that its demands were clear: it would not resume aid unless the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties signed a "written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The representative of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafay, said that the three inspectors could "too soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new government "what should be done to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although the exact date had not yet been set.
There's enough thread in the Greek ball for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope."
The Queen stressed Spain's "principal" position with regard to this type of finance.
Spain "has a prominent place in the world in the area of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades, the country had become the second largest donor in terms of instruments of cooperation, whose substance, she said, was "a tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity based on faith in human beings".
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt that such action is "perfectly necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and "especially with the goal of halving the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is established".
Spain "is still working" to expand the network of recipients around the world and takes on this task with all due diligence, says Donya Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements made during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will "give new opportunities and opportunities to the poorest people, and especially to women, "the main recipients of these loans".
There are many achievements and many difficulties we face.
The Microcredit Summit is becoming not only a platform for disputes, but also a platform that promotes "two main objectives".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and 100 million of these households would emerge from the poverty into which they were trapped.
The impetus to the creation of a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world "walked on the path begun years ago" by Muhammad Yunus emphasized Ms. Sofia as an "act of justice and recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as "a remarkable idealist in the universal fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to explore his lending policies on the ground.
One year later, the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I have seen continuous development everywhere", said Her Majesty, whose link to the project gave her the title yesterday of "head of the family", which was assembled in Valledoleda as a "poor bank".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her statement by calling on those present to participate in the debate and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, said that solidarity was an "ethical imperative" for every democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, as it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez concluded that microcredit implied "a serious and firm policy aimed at eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" developed country Governments should work in solidarity and not allow it to fall victim to cost reductions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main areas of cooperation for development".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, praised the "failure" in giving "the confidence" to the people who had "the door closed" and the Mayor of Valyadolid Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed everyone present in the city, who "opens his doors in a spirit of solidarity".
HDZ proposes to elect the Chairman of the European Commission by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDD) on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without major problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
Europe's future was not originally planned in the program, but it was born in the autumn itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policy is far from as strict as it should be today for Greece and perhaps tomorrow for Italy...
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, which had been introduced by the guide, had been adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The stands, which lasted for several minutes, and which earned their performances by Angel Merkel and several hours later by Wolfgang Schoyble, Eurofil and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The key message of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is that the correct answer to the crisis is "not less than Europe but more than Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, it's time for a breakthrough in Europe.
This may mean a change in the Lisbon Treaty, making it possible for the European Union to strengthen its control over the financial policies of the eurozone countries, but it may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a universal vote "to give Europe a face".
In any event, it is one of the proposals of a draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which apparently belongs to Wolfgang Schoyble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will agree quickly to this decision; Britain opposes this, and the leaders of the HDZ believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is against it, too.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, delegates, by an overwhelming majority, rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each EU member country on the board of the European Central Bank according to the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
In an effort to calm the situation in her party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence the Congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in difficult circumstances who like to criticize "high-handed" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devotes an entire paragraph to the importance of "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just passing by.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What's a sick-leave fraud?
Following the cash benefits, UMP and the government launched an attack on hospital sheets.
On 15 November, Nicola Sarkozy will come to Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefit Allocation Fund and give a speech on the subject, which has been periodically raised since 2007, on the fight against fraud in the area of social benefits.
And in order to help this offensive, which comes out of wanting to save in a difficult situation, but which also forms part of the right-wing campaign for presidential re-election, most people want to focus on sick leave.
First of all, with a view to saving the budget, the Government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on employees of private companies prior to the payment of the benefit.
Obviously, without the employer ' s special consent, the sick worker will lose his/her salary in four days, at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to create a storm of anger, but which Les Echos reports will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, to impose one day on public servants without a sickness benefit (public servants have not yet had to wait for the benefit, as opposed to a three-day waiting period for private sector employees).
Now that these issues are under discussion, the majority is also raising the issue of fraud, with regard to abuse in the issuance of hospital sheets.
Control will become more severe and, in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all the illegal payments you received," Xavier Bertrand warned on RTL on Saturday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital sheets.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been subjected to constant monitoring and political attacks that bear fruit.
People in France don't get sick any more than they do elsewhere in Europe.
Let's take a look at the country first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, the daily compensation costs of Euro11.3 million in 2008 represented 5 per cent of total health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46 per cent related to maternity leave and industrial accidents and 54 per cent to sickness benefits, which amounted to Euro6.2 million.
Consequently, it accounted for 2.5 per cent of health-related costs.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in hospital in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
The arithmetic mean, which conceals certain deviations; another study published in 2007 by Monster.com's career management website, showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said that they had not taken a day of sick leave.
Another study, this time concerning health insurance, states that in 2010 37 per cent of the hospital population lasted less than 8 days, 15 per cent between 15 days and one month, 15 per cent between one and three months and 11 per cent longer.
If you compare these figures to those of European neighbors, you can see that French workers are no more likely to take a sick leave than those of any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001, the total unemployment rate in France (for health reasons or not) varied between 10% and 11%, compared to 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with sick leave is very low compared to "grey" employment.
As for the level of fraud, it's very low.
The strengthening of the law since 2002 has led to a systematic review of hospital periods longer than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term reports were "unjustified" or too long", amounting to 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital sheets longer than 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were "unappropriate or unjustified", which is 132,000.
Overall, 169,000 cases were "unfounded" for several million workers who received sick leave.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, for example, "grey" employment.
According to UMP deputy Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, they amount to between 9,000 and 15,000 million euros of lost budgetary revenue per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore is infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Papadimos: Greece should follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos announced this in Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his coalition Government were not sufficient to carry out this task.
"In order to achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who made his first public statement opening a debate on the credibility of Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October should be the "core task" of the new Government, as the country's presence in the Eurozone was at stake, he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos projects a reduction in the country's budget deficit to "approximately 9 per cent" of GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Right-wings reject the measures of the new government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We won't vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with his party deputies, New Democracy.
He expressed his agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debts and combating waste, but also his rejection of any course that hindered economic recovery.
Ollie Renou, the European Commissioner for Economy and Finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary loan of 8,000 million euros without written assurances from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
euthanasia and suicide with outside help must be legalized, said the committee of experts
Canadians are denied death, claimed in the Royal Society of Canada report
With regard to palliative medicine, the committee argues that the Government, health-care institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, not including cancer.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
The Committee suggests that the Government amend the penal code to permit suicide with outside assistance and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
For starters, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is in 10th place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death".
Medically or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, provided by experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dead in a hospital.
The highest rate in the country is in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide with outside help, the report concludes that it is contrary to the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the penal code with regard to euthanasia and suicide with outside assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization involves abuse of use, i.e. the commission of euthanasia or suicide with outside assistance against people who are unable or unwilling to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed during a teleconference that the majority of such cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicides were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
A self-inflicted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is obviously illegal, explaining Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia because, according to a 2010 survey by Angus Reid, they believe that this will allow people to alleviate their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66 percent think that legalizing euthanasia will not signal that the lives of the elderly or the disabled are less valuable.
In the case of people who assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of those interviewed felt that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care, the situation was less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also propose, among other recommendations, that the Penal Code should establish that legal termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires health professionals to be trained in a spirit of respect for the end-of-life abandonment of medical care without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the committee called on the Government, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminological siting already widely used in Canadian health-care institutions, the committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to dull physical pain like euthanasia and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some experts in the area of health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Metr Pierre Deshan, a health legislation specialist, described the "creature" of the experts who signed the report, because, among other things, it did not limit the use of euthanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide, says MT Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also stressed that the report seemed to place individual independence above all other values that formed the social fabric of society.
He said that "there are warning signs and prohibitions in society."
The health legislation specialist Margaret Somerville also expresses "the categorical disagreement with the findings of the report, which she called "a manifeste for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, inter alia, the report ' s findings concerning abuses in some countries where euthanasia and suicide with outside assistance are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to surrender power
Damascus condemns the "conspiracy"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated.
Bashar Assad's supporters demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure intensified on Syria Bashar Assad, who, with Russia's support, resists it and condemns the "conspiracy" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria ' s membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union had tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syria ' s neighbours Turkey and Jordan had advocated the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday became the first Arab leader to call upon President Bashar Assad to relinquish power in Syria, where some 40 other civilians and members of the regime ' s armed forces were killed.
"If the interests of his country were dear to Bashar, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life," said the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview with BBC.
In turn, the Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, expressed regret that Turkey ' s mediation efforts, which had begun earlier this year, had failed.
Those in the Middle East who did not live in peace with their people and who could not satisfy their aspirations would lose power, he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country to which Turkey was taking an increasingly rigid course.
For its part, the United States welcomes the "enlargement of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are increasingly taking a tougher stance against repression in Syria, and Mark Toner, a representative of the State Department, has noted.
During that time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime ' s armed forces died in the Dar ' a area in southern Syria, according to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents died in a shooting and heavy machine gun fire in Jobar in the besieged city of Homs, according to this ONG.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis."
In addition, he reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which he said was "a dangerous step".
Syria will not be broken, he added, assuring that this plot against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying "the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires 500 members of the Arab Organization for Human Rights, journalists and military observers.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from repression of a regime he said had entered "paranoia".
The League ' s new emergency meeting is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis recovery plan adopted on 2 November, which includes, inter alia, the withdrawal of armed forces from fighting cities and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described yesterday as "uncorrect" the decision of the League of Arab States, while China called on Syria to implement a plan to emerge from the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time from Italian markets and victims.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monty, asked the markets for a little time to form their team and execute a program that would require "victims" to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi's rule.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in discussions with political parties prior to today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet made up of technocrats who are not members of Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of a multi-victim programme, said Francesco Nukara, a representative of one of many small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions following the meeting with the Prime Minister's candidate.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said that he would wait to see if Mario Monty would ask Parliament to vote on confidence before Friday to make sure that the new government had sufficient support.
The meeting will conclude with a limited list of dozens or so of Mr. Monty ' s head of the country, George Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on the nervousness of stock exchanges and bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
"Democraty takes time to prepare government and programme," he stressed, adding that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understanding."
His appointment as president was initially approved by the markets, but concerns re-emerged, particularly after the sudden fall of industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The Prime Minister-designate was to form a team, including, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include "politics".
The new Government would have to operate until 2013, the date of the next elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will receive a vote of confidence in Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that when he took office, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important actor in Europe.
The representative of European Commissioner Ollie Ren stressed that "in spite of the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed".
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not meet its 2013 budget, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, had demanded, inter alia, new and stringent measures.
The Italian "boss boss" Emma Marchaglia, who will meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet its deficit parameters".
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence as the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents the "change of the era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", "professor", symbolizing "a challenge of seriousness" and "a different Italy", according to the authors of the editorials.
The great unknown is the durability of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid an early election, since by April 2012 Italy would have made payments in the amount of Euro200,000 million for public debt.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program.
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danielenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, confirmed on Monday an American nuclear-risk agency.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the United Nations Agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the "possible military aspect" of Iran's nuclear programme
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934 and worked for 30 years "since the 1960s at the Soviet Military Nuclear Centre in Chelabinsca (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds in the methods of explosion".
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to set up a company that produced nanoalmages in Kiev.
His company ' s financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with Iran ' s programme from 1996 to 2002, pending his return to Russia
In its report, IAEA refers to "clear indications that Iran's development of the nuclear detonators system" was facilitated by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technology well, but who also told the Agency that he had worked most of his career on this technology as part of his home country's military nuclear programme".
Anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence decreased slightly or did not change over the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 per cent, compared with an increase of 13 per cent in cases of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4 per cent in attacks against Jews and an overall increase of 14 per cent in the number of religious crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very little to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
After a decline in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of these crimes is rising again, human rights organization Human Rights First stresses that "the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant", adding the organization in an official communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as serious violations of human rights", added a leader of Paul Lejandr.
"The American Government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes."
"Hate crimes" in federal law are the legacy of a period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after Martin Luther King ' s death to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and sexual orientation today.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook
On Monday, Twitter's microblog site changed the image of its platform to allow users to see, inter alia, the activity of those they watch, which makes it similar to Facebook.
The new activity tab and other name tab allow for easier and more direct monitoring of the activities of other Twitter users, Internet users whose messages (tweets) you track, and those who track yours.
This provides an opportunity to learn if they publish messages, if they sign new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "at a small percentage of users in August" before being made available to the public on Monday, telling AFP to release Twitter to Caroline Penner.
Twitter, which has long been known as intuitively rather incomprehensible and as using rather vague terms (RT to repost someone else's message, #followfriday to recommend tracking other users), mostly while enjoying experienced users, discovers itself in this way for a wider audience, presenting users with something closer to popular Facebook and Google+ social networks.
On the Internet, users discussed this innovation using Twitter.
"It's useless, obsessive and too much like Facebook."
Functional activity will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter stream, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of the "gold rule" of the budget in the Constitution
The leadership of the large coalition of social democrats and Christian democrats in Austria decided on Tuesday to write down a budgetary "gold rule" in the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid possible downgrading of Austria's state credit rating agencies (triple A).
The Chancellor of Social Democracy, Werner Faymann, personally announced the decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with the Austrian public debt of 74.6 per cent, which is much higher than the 60 per cent ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's capacity to pay fell by only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest by 3,000 million euros more each year, put forward an argument by the Vice Chancellor and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus met the demand of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; the heads of State and Government demanded a reduction of fiscal deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The regulation adopted by the Austrian Government resembles the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt the "rule".
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017, the structural deficit of the federal State budget should not exceed 0.35% of GDP in any year, and land, like communes, should submit balanced budgets.
The goal is to force public debt to fall below the 60 per cent mark of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esikhiko Noda
Threatened by a new intervention in the foreign exchange market
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yeshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would make further interventions in the currency market if the value of the yen continued to rise.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the exchange rate too volatile for the yen, Mr. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen grew to almost a historic point, which prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which has set a new record of strength since 1945.
But since then, the yen has been growing constantly, driven by the purchases of investors who perceive it as "as a refuge" in these vague times of economic collapse around the world and of Europe's debt crisis.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic point of 105 yen, close to the level that triggered the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar cost about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
Japan ' s currency growth is detrimental to Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces Japanese firms ' foreign income when converted into national currency.
"Japan is fighting to restore itself" after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), stressed Mr. Noda, who fears that this growth of yen will kill the fragile embryo of recovery.
The world ' s third largest economic power resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, owing to the increase in exports and consumption of disaster-affected households
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect Japan's fundamental economic performance.
Minister of Finance Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy board on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy manager of Hirohid Yamaghuti warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken "appropriate steps", making it clear that no further mitigation should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the issuing organization increased by 5,000 million yen (47,000 million euros) the purchase of treasury bonds, raising to 55,000 million yen (519,000 million euros) the ceiling it allocates to the purchase of various financial instruments to fill the securities market.
Eurozone
Rates are rising, stock exchanges are swinging.
The risk of exposure to the debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and the improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in fragile countries continue to rise
Still concerned about eurozone stability, European exchanges left this Tuesday, 15 November, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and finished bidding at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London fell by 0.1%.
Owing to the new difficulties in lending to the hard-hit eurozone countries, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
"Satisfied investors are just too worried about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, the institutional broker IG Markets quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo Exchange closed with a fall of 0.7% under the weight of new market doubts about Europe ' s ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has looked at Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in the narrow change corridor until investors have confirmation that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsusege Aquino, the fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return of concern about the eurozone's future strikes a single currency that continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lowest point in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570, falling by 0.4 per cent.
According to the brokers, it fell after the meeting of Chancellor Angela Merkel HDZ on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, inter alia, for a country in a difficult situation to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are substantially higher than 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
This morning, on Tuesday, Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2 percent.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of the participants.
Mario Monty, the head of the future Italian government, asked the time markets to restore the situation in Italy, which was under threat of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
Greece's new Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be the "core task" of his Government.
Spain was under fire in the markets before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread between interest rates on the ten-year debt of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical maximum.
Waiting for the Eurozone growth figures
France recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3 per cent, owing to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised the second quarter downwards, with a fall of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first assessment for the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be resolved after a brief discussion or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy trend that electoral meetings provide a basis for reflection on the share and place of nuclear power.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options have been examined.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and sound data.
We are now 7,000 million people on the planet, and demographic development will double the need for electricity by 2050, unless a large part of the world ' s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the increasing scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to generate electricity at all times, bearing in mind the crucial need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to address the climate imbalance, a theme that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident doesn't change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision conditional on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear power, or of Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Finland, Poland, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are only a few of those who are resolutely pursuing their projects.
The United States decided, after Fukushima, to add one installation to its kit by resuming the construction of the station that had been interrupted following the Tri-Miyle Island accident.
Although the German renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
Berlin ' s choice will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, compounded by an increased demand for imported gas, particularly from Russia, and a surge in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be felt.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
The European Turbine Champion, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to intermittent wind, resulting in carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices being 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher, respectively, than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40 per cent more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy the price of energy is a key factor in the competitiveness and maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity available in Europe.
Consequently, any meaningful reduction in nuclear power will result in a huge increase in the cost of electricity, which will make the beautiful statements about our country ' s new industrialization and the protection of purchasing power an illusion.
The price most French refuse to pay, especially since they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy made it possible to create an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a wide range of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises in international trade and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France had decided to abandon nuclear power, it would have to sacrifice a large number of those enterprises and lose 6,000 million euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What kind of electrician would order an EPR designed to run for 60 years if it was planned to shut down its manufacturer?
To solve the energy equation, it must be recognized that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy production.
Areva's development of low-carbon solutions, nuclear and renewable, is indicative of the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power to maintain the highest level of safety is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security body that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are full of the same obsession with security.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major incidents.
Only one, Tri-Miyle Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the reactor device and the unforgivable human error led to a tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force, which resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this accident, as it has learned from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and of the cooperation between the safety authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project that can be countered.
As it is considered by all energy specialists who wish to build a reactor, stopping its construction in Flamanville will be an excellent gift to competitors of Areva and EDF, paving the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased manoeuvres to prevail in a dispute that is so important to our country ' s economic, social and financial situation.
Immigration is a burden or good for the economy?
The policy of immigration under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from a variety of points of view - the overloading of police, judicial and administrative services subordinate to the policy of numeracy and its compatibility with France's self-proclaimed status as a "human rights State".
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which came into the news, when the Minister of the Interior (Liberación of 23 May) said that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waiters".
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is much agreement between the right and the left on this issue.
The right tone was set by Jacques Shirac, who in 1976 stated that "900,000 unemployed will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers", and by the left, Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France "can't accept the poor from all over the world".
The only difference is the level of generosity.
In 2005, fear of invasion by the Polish plumber was felt by both left and right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden on the French economy and on French society.
The only difference is the level of generosity that they intend to show to immigrants.
In his program, François Holland confined himself to platitudes, saying that "joint work will solve our immigration problem".
This perception of immigration as a burden and a problem may give an electoral advantage, but it is economically expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book summarizing recent immigration data (Special People: How Migration has shaped our world and will shape our future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among professionals about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting immigration reduces growth and reduces employment.
Fear of immigrants ' influence is based on the perception that they can replace local workers, especially the low-skilled, by triggering lower wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than they are replacing local labour by performing jobs that lack local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour and the most skilled work in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
Positive impact on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity that exists between locals and immigrants results in the arrival of immigrants having a positive impact on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1 per cent increase in migration flows led to an increase of 0.6-0.9 per cent in real long-term wages.
This goes without the fact that the diversity of immigrants has contributed to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (the United States Nobel Prize winners have a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo have all been based on immigrants).
Migrants also bring net profits to social security systems, giving an average of 1 per cent of the total European budgets.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, in Germany, an immigrant who arrived at the age of 30 will make a net profit (income minus expenditure) to the State budget in his or her lifetime, on average 150,000 euros.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy was going to "tooth" cling to missing growth points.
The teeth mentioned, which were used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, remains to reflect on European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; it is also fragile.
The European continent must remember that, in its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the twentieth century it experienced the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulf, Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some believed that in order for democracy to finally prevail over its enemies, it was sufficient to organize a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's time, "Malogo" has known that this is due to the superficiality of thinking.
Universal suffrage, although a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even become "a tool of repression", as Etienne Vastro, a Republican philosopher once said.
No, democracy requires many other things: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palinodia of the true and living Greek referendum will have a double revealing effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious change in policy and the unpleasant sense of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now moved, and many believe that Republican soldiers are now targeting the wrong direction.
We will win nothing by demanding a series of national referendums, organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
Cart Blanche for an absolute European monarch or a jump with bound legs into the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream of a guillotine blade, but of implementation - joint, clear and continuous - of choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is not known how many more will have to be listed because there is only one crisis: the crisis in Europe.
Europe as a whole is subject to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
Europe is completely humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of European sovereignty, but Europe as a whole is gradually losing its sovereignty, together with each of its nations.
There is an urgent need to restore the management of the European project to the people ' s sovereignty.
Because only by working together can Europeans reduce everyone's debt burden, free themselves from markets, and prepare for the future by investing in it.
Recovering from the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without leading us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delor, everyone now demands a European economic government.
So be it.
But to imagine it without the stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has come to life is yet another madness and a new impasse.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to create Republicans.
A revolution of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a Europe united at the economic level.
This can only be done through the creation of a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European sovereignty for the people.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
Contactless chips are spreading more and more.
The World Chip Card Exhibition opens on Tuesday in Wilpente, Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, 2011 will end with 11% growth in world sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM cards), exceeding 6,000 million according to Eurosmart.
The most important is the non-compact technology sector, which allows public transportation or shopping to be paid by simply mapping the reader.
This year, the world will sell 460 million contactless chips, compared to 320 million this year!
Their share will increase in 2012 (580 million units expected) to reach almost 10 per cent of the world market for chip cards (6.925 million maps).
Europe, long behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of non-interact payments.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting from a more modest position, with 400,000 contactless maps of Visa in circulation.
But big stores are increasing their pace.
This year, Carrefour released 2.5 million unconnected Pass MasterCard.
To move to a higher speed, banks need to equip their customers.
"Two large organizations in France promised to systematically distribute to their customers bank cards adapted for non-compatible use in the future," reported Gérard Nebuye, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments with a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage of the development of a future payment facility, that is, a mobile phone.
So far, only a few machines are equipped with NFC (near field communication) technology needed to perform such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they should really fly next year."
"We count on world sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012," explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricol announced an experiment from December to June next year in Qana.
The iPhone machines of approximately 200 clients and staff will be equipped with lockers that provide non-compact payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that he was preparing to launch a proposal on the market that would allow his clients to pay through mobile phones.
The terrorist front spreads from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-held links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that the Algerians were now confident.
"The method used by the two organizations and the reports of the secret services show that they cooperate actively," he explained, without going into detail.
Paris seems to have reached similar conclusions.
The investigation into the abduction of two French men in the Niger in January revealed two links.
Kidnapped at a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leocour and Vincent Delory were apparently killed the following day, along with several of the kidnappers, during an operation carried out by the French Special Forces.
Among the remains of the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone symcards belonging to terrorists.
Axis of Terror
An analysis of the calls made indicated several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one refers to a Nigerian who has lived long in Maidiguri, a town in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram's cradle, and the other to a man who is said to be close to Aqmi and the cult.
"This is a step forward, but surely we must wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for many years that the sect is receiving financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active," says Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type used by Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, is now putting pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the challenges posed by Boko Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of enlightened people of no interest.
Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri, at the mosque, at the school and at the imam fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which on House means "Western education is sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It was politicized and demanded strict observance of the Shariah, and its activists had begun to fight against the wicked central government.
It focuses mainly on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in many attacks on police stations.
Abuji's reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the cult is radicalized and will go beyond its northern vaults.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an action that killed 80 people in Jos, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram organized the first suicide attack on a reinforced police headquarters in Abuja.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, which comes from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a concern for all security experts.
Now that Aqmi has been strengthened in Mali and Niger and Somalis from Al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, in a conversation with Presidents Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppe, he warned of the danger of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all available information.
The world, as the Republican presidential candidates see it,
With regard to China, Iran, and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, lead a complex world with simple, if not simple, ideas?
If you listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe it.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry, and other many loud but devoid of details about foreign policy, which are traditionally the strength of Republicans.
Luzungi of China, Iran, and aid to Israel are often mixed up.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of running from the Good Party Star, threatened to file a complaint with the WTO against the Chinese and accuse them of "manipulating his currency is a sensitive topic for America, annoying the migration of its entire industries to Asia.
Even worse, if it led to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Obama's Ambassador to China and the only candidate who knows about complex foreign policy, has failed to overcome a position that encourages emotion.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now Obama ' s position).
But Huntsman, who's in the bottom of the ratings, hasn't been heard.
Reagan style.
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if sanctions failed to stop his nuclear programme.
"If I'm chosen, I'll stop Iran," he said."
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen military assistance to Israel by accusing Obama of failing to fulfil his promises to that partner.
Businessman Herman Kane, second in a candidate rating, showed a discouraging lack of knowledge.
He recently called to confront the Chinese military threat because Beijing was trying to achieve nuclear power — apparently not knowing that China had already possessed it since 1964!
Governor Texas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military attacks on Iran, says he is ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Kane, Perry and candidate Michelle Bachman also recommend torture of terrorist suspects banned by Obama in 2009.
This is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, the heavy weight of foreign policy.
The current president's opponents say that Reagan had simple ideas, too, and that he won the cold war.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to lower the tone of the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the premature withdrawal of the "guys" from Iraq, his tricks in Libya, which have brought him a reputation for weak politics.
But the offensive isn't that easy.
The population believes that the national security balance under Obama, which eliminated Ben-Laden, is positive.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that are stuck in the sand.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to restore its leadership, Obama is right.
North Flow, a new gate for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The Northern Flow, which connects Western Europe and Russia directly through the Baltic Sea, has been launched.
It is designed to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with pompa.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between the orchestra's performance and the fine snacks, in the opening of the Northern Flow, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitrymedev, French Prime Minister François Fiyon and his Dutch colleague, Marth Rütte, turned together the symbolic valve controlling the flow of Russian gas to the Western European network.
Under the new gas pipeline, 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas will flow to Western Europe each year through the first 1,224 km long pipeline linking Leningrad region to the land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline should be ready by the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to all French consumption.
The possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met with fierce opposition from Poland and the Baltic States.
Northern flow will indeed allow gas to be transported directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Polshu or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose part of their power: they will find it more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop before comparing the North Flow with the new "German Soviet Pact", implying an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
It means that the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is working towards greater security of its supplies.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between eastern and western Europe.
Russia has managed in less than five years to achieve its understanding of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large quantities of gas and whose own reserves are already running out.
"This gas pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it's a new artery that organically binds us," said François Fiyon, opening the gas pipeline, showing to what extent big gas contracts are both politically and economically important.
All this explains the big smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Ljubmin, the gas point of arrival.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel, confined to concrete, to protect it from anchors of ships.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, we had to bypass the minefields left over from the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Mueller, the press secretary of North Flow.
Many steps were also needed to protect fauna and flora.
The pipe is a long metal snake of a weight equal to 242 Eiffel Towers, without bursts throughout its length, without valves, and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers abandoned it because Sweden was not thrilled that the Russian state company would settle forever off its coast.
"In case of an accident, we'll cut off the gas flow in less than a minute," says Jens Mueller.
So if there's a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will go into the air.
But it seems unlikely to the designers who designed the stitches to leak only once every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the gas pipeline will be carried out by an underwater robot that pulls the ship for external observation, as well as by a apparatus that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
A cigar-like apparatus shall be introduced into a pipe with a diameter of 1 metre and pushed forward by a flow of gas.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second, he provides accurate information on any deformation of the metal.
The gas line was designed to operate for 50 years without any need for repair.
The gas shall be circulated only by its pressure.
It is 200 bar on departure and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement the project.
Gazprom, which owns 51% of the capital, remains the leader.
The rest are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Netherlands Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies established a joint venture called the North Flow, which was responsible for the construction and operation of a gas pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Zuga, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company for 20 years, with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
"Gazprom will pay for the full volume, no matter how much gas is actually transported," says Jens Müller.
The gas pipeline was financed by 30 per cent of shareholders and 70 per cent of bank loans.
The total cost of the work would be Euro7.4 million for two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investment will be about 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure they're gonna spend their money because Gazprom is taking all the risks.
The gas pipeline leaves the Baltic Sea in Ljubmina on a sandy shore planted with coniferous trees.
The vents are four and a half metres high and form an output gas terminal.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour, and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine brand notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will restore taste to the letter.
He has a scent of adventure, hours spent behind the letter in the light of the candle.
Moleskine's block is easy to read on a rectangular black cover, by rubber, by yellow-and-white pages, as if yellowed over time.
However, Moleskine's notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, has decided to sell design notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's then consultant, claimed responsibility for launching the new product.
The block is inspired by the old technology, the moleskin - laced cotton cloth used, for example, to cover benches.
This type of notebook is said to be highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought into line with today's taste the old and forgotten thing that was a cult for avant-garde artists until the twentieth century," said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the manager of a brand in Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25% to 12.7 million.
We were far from producing the first years when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed Italy's borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It's hard to profile a typical buyer because the notebook is equally attractive to a businessman, student, and a free trader.
The buyers of Moleskine are cosmopolitan, have broad views and are educated.
A small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in Fnac bookshops, shops in the centres of small cities, and has been able to gain widespread visibility.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new need for a letter despite the appearance of an e-mail," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural feature has accompanied the development of Moleskine; recently, the brand organized an exhibition called "The United Way", where architects and artists demonstrated their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched the cover of a leopard painting on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Using its success and its cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified his products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and brand includes all kinds of support.
In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which has written a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19 per cent of disabled persons seek employment.
The 15th week of employment for disabled persons begins today.
Despite the policy of public charity launched in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19 per cent as against 9 per cent for the general population.
Disappointing?
"No," says Eric Blanche, Director General of Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for disabled people."
"A great deal of progress has been made in 15 years."
"The unemployment rate was three times higher at the time, not two."
"But there's still a lot of work to do."
It must be said that there are still many barriers to employment for a disabled person.
Of these, 37 per cent are older than 50 years of age (17 per cent on average).
Rather, they have low qualifications: 80 per cent do not have a bachelor ' s degree and only 10,000 out of 2.3 million students in higher education are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, is very common, compared with 38 per cent on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and that are at the heart of the problem", according to Christian Grapen, Director General Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies hire a disabled worker.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about mentalities that are changing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre Association on behalf of Cité revealed that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge of disability and "presumed complete people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally disabled persons".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of having 6 per cent of disabled workers set out in the 1987 law.
The most recent known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
"We're about 3% today," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefe, the organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of "taxed" organizations, like the amounts paid, decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 in 2007-2011 (and from Euro606 to Euro480 million).
"The 2005 Act, which raised the tax, put a lot of pressure on companies, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also reflects an increase in consciousness, particularly in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with between 20 and 49 employees have disabled workers, compared to 82 per cent of organizations with between 100 and 199 employees.
Azar: "What happiness."
Before fighting the Blues on Tuesday night (20.45 hours), Eden Azar and Georges Leekens did not conceal the pleasure they enjoyed from this friendly match.
We're not gonna make it to the point that there was a conspiracy between them, but the painting is symbolic.
While sitting next to the arena of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months after his attacker's act against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his promotion, and the fact that he's Belgian."
"I want to move on," Lille's player says.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and in the team, it's one thing, he's justified.
"I'm in Lille all year round, but I'm not in Belgium."
"I have to earn my glasses."
Left behind in the run-up to this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to Saint-Deni to finally shine.
Not forgetting, however, the notion of "pleasure."
He supported the Blues since the age of 7 and the 1998 and 2000 winning campaigns.
"I've always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also reinforces the special character of the match.
And especially the fact that Mathieu, Johan and Adil were on the other side," he recalled.
"Just our roads crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens kindly remembered the "horrity."
"Greatness" to play in a "festival match."
Pride also claims as a "neighbor" that France "began to become a very high-level team" just a year after the Naizna injury.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderstorm, he admired it.
Now that Belgium has missed the next Euro, the tech athlete will be on the same plane with the blues... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up," he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll make sure of that in future games, including this one against France."
Portugal is very confident.
Portugal, Paulo Bentou, begins his counter-offer against Bosnia (22.00 hours) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to lose their sense of reality.
"By the end of those 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt to him that the Assembly, which has been running it since September 2010, is classified as Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a match to play, and there's Bosnia to win.
With 0-0 on Friday in Hell Zenica, it's clear the game isn't over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to achieve the ambitious goal that would calm her down.
"It's a good result, but it does entail some risk."
But in his brightly lit de la Luz stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of a public that should be thrilled, although the match will be very tense," said the optimistic but reasonable Bent.
"We expect a very intense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance of getting to the Euro 2012", the successor to Carlos Keiroš failed.
No one on Friday against Bosnia demands that the Portuguese win.
No one could arrange for the Bosniacs.
"It's a good result, but there's some risk," Bent's regret.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical merit and players with a lot of individual merit," he added.
As was already the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the beginning, "not give them time to think."
It's a good idea if it's realistic this time.
