In Kineshma and the district, two men committed suicide
Previously, one of the hanged had attempted suicide.
On October 30, around 1:00, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging in Lugowa village.
It is known that he has attempted suicide before.
What led a man to do that is unknown.
On 31 October, at 11-50, a 41-year-old male resident of Kineshma died in his home.
No signs of violent death have been found, as reported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs Press Service, Kineshemsky.
Is there a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the falling highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box carefully built on your car's dashboard.
These devices, which track every mile driven by a motorist and transmit this information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to modernize the outdated American highway financing system undertaken by the planning authorities of Washington and the state.
Usually, the boring arena of highway planning suddenly generated intense debate and coloured alliances.
The Liberians joined environmental groups in lobbying the government to use small boxes to track the number of miles you travel and, perhaps, where you pass them, and then to use that information in tax accounts.
Tea party movement is in shock.
The American Union of Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy.
Although Congress is not yet in a position to agree whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They reflect on how to move over the next decade to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of the road they pass.
Thousands of motorists have already tested these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
"This is not a question on which we may have a choice," said Hassan Ihrata, Executive Director of the Association of Southern California Government, who is preparing plans to begin tracking down the miles of every California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's already technology for that.
This is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Roads Fund, which is financed by taxes paid by Americans at gas stations.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars travel more than miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn't been up for 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise the tax by even one cent at high petrol prices.
"The gasoline tax is simply impossible to keep," said Lee Mannich, transport policy expert at Minnesota University.
His State had recently installed 500 tracking devices on vehicles to test the system.
"It will be the best alternative in the long term," he said.
The assholes call it a mercy user's fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The planning authorities in California are looking at this system in developing strategies to meet the targets set by the State ' s ambitious laws against global warming.
However, House Member Bill Schuester (Republican, Pennsylvania), President of the Chamber's Transport Committee, said that he too saw the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free-market members at the Reason Foundation are also thrilled that drivers will be forced to pay for every mile.
"It's not just a tax that goes into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Political Affairs Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Ministers of Transport, who in 2011 called on Congress to move towards a payment of mercy.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, involving some 10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of the fear of rural legislators representing voters, who often have to travel miles to work or to the city in their daily lives.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The state of Oregon is the most enthusiastic one, where 5,000 drivers are recruited to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers are about to pay the state for miles away instead of the gas tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It's under review in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And Coalition I-95, which includes the transport departments of the 17 states of the Eastern Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteer vehicles had recently been equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could track every move.
"Satisfaction about a big brother and similar things is a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, the head of strategy and performance management in the Nevada State Transport Department.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the trials were well under way, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website that it would be easy to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices.
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of several states where it is difficult to find low-cost technology that would allow state authorities to keep track of the miles they drive, but without information about the place and time.
If you could do that, Han said, society would feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
The company did not initially assist in the collection of state taxes.
It has sought to enter the developing market of the type of car insurance in which drivers pay on a mileage basis.
But the devices she's testing attract road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do so if you don't track their speed and their location," said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There were some big mistakes in some of these pilot state programs.
There are much less expensive and less obsessive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with providing drivers with different options.
They can choose the device with or without GPS.
Or they can give up the device altogether, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state.
In other places, they're hoping to sell the idea to the alerted public, forcing the devices to do more than less.
In New York, transport officials are seeking to develop a tax device that will also accept parking meter charges, provide "pay as you drive" insurance and collect real-time speed data pools from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic congestion.
"The automobilists will engage in the benefits offered to them," says the urban design document.
Some designers of transport systems, however, are wondering if all the talk of a pardon is simply a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Bay City Transport Commission, officials say that Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the highway trust fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles do not use much petrol to pay their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you have to do is take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
The EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in the event of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with IMF on an emergency loan, if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
Negotiations are under way with IMF on a stand-by loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their aim was to conclude an agreement soon.
In addition to a potential IMF loan, Ukraine could receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF can overcome long-standing differences about the terms of financing.
Neither does the international rating agency S&P, which lowered Ukraine's sovereign rating by one step on Friday, to "B-" with "B."
The EU representatives say, however, that IMF can be flexible in lending terms, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country's financial support plan, the EU has a stand-by option for providing Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of which is now supplied from Russia.
It might be a northern stream gas or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia "insulates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this mode of reverse transfers to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks and is likely to reduce supplies to other regions.
"The EU and Ukrainians are negotiating how to create favourable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from sources other than Russia or from the same source but on other routes", Reuters added.
Russia is not fighting for urban pollution by automobiles.
Efforts to address the transport problems of large cities have been evident in most mega-cities of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
In general, these were either the upgrading and expansion of roads or attempts to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of vehicles and the time of their use.
The example of Singapore was well known, with a strict quota of private car growth and the right to purchase it by auction.
Its price can be two to three times that of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced fees for entering the city centre.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green areas are introduced, which are only allowed to enter vehicles with a certain eco-class, which also use high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a five-year clean air plan in 2012 with a total cost of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As stated by JO, the Director of the Transport Pollution Control Unit of Beijing's Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, Lee Kunseng, the main goal of the five-year-old is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, to increase the number of private cars to no greater than 6 million (now 5.2 million) and to increase fuel use by no more than 5 per cent per vehicle.
According to the agency, vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
The main measures of the programme are the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for motorists.
Among other things, the urban measures of the Green Five-Years include the accelerated transition to Euro-fuel standards compared to the rest of the country, the introduction of a local eco-standard system and the labelling of cars and fuels, restrictions on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, the prohibition of obsolete vehicles (other than the creation of incentive financial programmes to replace old cars with hybrids or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and service transport), and the development of public transport (including high-speed).
The car innovation in Beijing also includes a ban on all private cars within the fifth transport ring (all six in the capital of the PRC) one day a week (this information is contained in the vehicle licence plate) and the issuance of lottery registration plates (for example, in 2011, the first year of operation of the lottery, the total number of private car registration permits in Beijing was only one third of 2010).
According to the current State programme for the protection of the environment for 2012-2020, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution is expected to decrease to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011, 41 per cent of all emissions to the urban atmosphere were "mobile sources".
In Moscow, for example, emissions from motor vehicles are 10 times higher than industrial emissions and in St. Petersburg nine times higher.
The Russian Federation is just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Michael Blinkin, Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Policy of the European Union, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel are not popular, but can be adopted by society only if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its vehicle fleet, with two clusters of weakly sensitive to any regulatory impact - service and personal vehicles, as well as vehicles of "privileged" users, with a total number of at least 200,000 (about 5 per cent of the total Moscow fleet).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM Centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study analysing the balance of urban areas between residential development, road surface area and the number of vehicles.
The main findings of researchers are that the city centre is twice as equipped with roads as required, and most motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them for long periods of time in parking or simply in the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build storage facilities rather than parking, rather than expanding the carriageway (to make the streets more friendly for pedestrians) and to limit the use and location of personal transport within the area of the protection zone of the historic centre (a total area of about 3,212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
Fines for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will rise once and for all
According to the city authorities, an increase in fines would help to clean up Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, and the products they sell often do not pass appropriate sanitary controls.
Which means the health of the vlogians is in jeopardy.
Thus, the lower penalty for unauthorized trade will be increased sixfold from 500 roubles to 3,000 roubles as of November, according to the Press Service of the Vologda Administration.
Goldman Sachs warned about the risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of the growing risks to Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payment of unsecured consumer loans and massive reductions in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it has been entirely driven by consumption, which has barely slowed down," declared Goldman Sachs' chief economist in Russia, Clemens Grafe, presenting yesterday's quarterly report of the Russian economics investor.
Russia now has a nominal salary increase of about 10%.
With an inflation rate of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, waiting for Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is declining, so they are likely to optimize staff costs.
Today, we see a substantial increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages rise by 10 per cent, GDP rises by only 2 per cent, Mr. Grafé explained.
Companies have experienced a decline in profitability.
If it does not grow, it could lead to layoffs and increased unemployment.
Russian business cannot raise wages, comments the major economist Barclays Capital on Russia and the CIS, Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment is close to historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise their salaries in order to lure their employees from outside or to keep them from doing so.
Russia's consumption is supported by a very rapid increase in the demand for credit.
In Mr. Grafe ' s view, because of the very high rates of consumer loans, this type of credit does not have a multiplier effect on the country ' s economy.
"The benefits to the economy of increasing demand for credit have not been seen, the money is not divided in the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments," said the economist.
But the other problem is that Goldman Sachs is expecting an increase in default on unsecured loans.
They are mostly taken by poor people who have nothing to provide for their welfare.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more frequently", Mr. Grafé noted.
The second threat to economic growth in Russia is therefore a possible crisis of non-payment of unsecured loans.
The Director of the VSE Banking Institute, Vasily Solodkov, is already seeing signs of an impending banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the cheap resources available to State banks, were forced to raise public funds at high interest rates.
In response, the state banks have embarked on the war path and began to lower their credit rates, an economist continues.
Small lending organizations cannot lend at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have negative interest margins.
If the state banks don't give up dumping, Russia faces a full-blown banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
The withdrawal of a number of banks' licences in recent weeks has been seen by an economist as a harbinger of mass collapse.
"The state banks themselves will not be able to cope with this situation: the deposit insurance scheme was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," the head of the institute warns.
But the increase in consumption will slow down without a crisis of non-payment, believed in an investment bank, due to the rejection of the indexation of government and military salaries in the current version of the draft budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of tariffs on natural monopolies (and consequently by a fall in inflation).
But only partially: if the investment does not grow (and the preconditions are not yet available - see the statement), the increase in consumption will slow down, I'm sure Goldman Sachs will.
Vladimir Pantushin of Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for implementing pessimistic scenarios.
"The primary risk is still the drop in the price of oil," he says.
He estimated that Russia's economy would begin to decline with oil prices below $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the BC is not yet in a position to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has declined and banks have begun to raise their stakes.
This may mean they didn't believe the C.E.C. that announced a shift to inflation targeting," said Clemens Grafe.
The interest policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, but only interbank lending rates.
"For the BC, it's a failure of all hope," Clemens Grafe appreciated.
Banks are not using the money obtained at the BC auction to lend to the economy, but to manage their liquidity.
Once the rate drops, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go into speculation against the ruble.
"The BC will realize that this strategy is not working sooner or later," said Mr. Grafe and recalled that the State is planning to release the ruble into "free navigation" by the end of 2015.
But either we have to do it sooner or raise the key B.C. rate (5.5 per cent), he thinks.
His estimate is that the ruble's rate is now artificially high by 10%.
I only have one road to go down, and the expert concludes.
But if the BC casts doubt in financiers that dismantling the currency corridor is not part of the policy of weakening the ruble, it could bring down the ruble much more.
The Second Congress of the South Ural peoples was held in Chelyabinsk.
The Forum commemorates the Day of People ' s Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The Congress was attended by delegations from all towns and regions of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive bodies, totalling approximately 350 persons.
The forum course is aimed at strengthening inter-ethnic harmony.
We can set an example here not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no differences of opinion or opinion.
We live in complete understanding," Feofan claims, the mitropolitics of Chelyabinsky and Zlatoustsky.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the education of patriotism and cultural cooperation.
At the end of the convention, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
This is the opening of an exhibition of national cultural associations in the Chelyabinsk region.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on a US intelligence issue.
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence debrief, stated that he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander could not answer questions about his activities.
A German deputy, Hans-Cristian Ströbele, met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, who was presented by the deputy to the media in Berlin on Friday, stated: "Even though the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to view dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political discourse by criminal charges that offer no protection."
However, it is not a crime to tell the truth.
In a letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany became tense following allegations that the NSA was listening to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who heads a parliamentary group responsible for the intelligence service, said that if there is an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, "without endangering him or destroying his relationship with the United States completely", it should be used.
Mr. Strebele, MP of the Green German Party, posted his photo with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strebele said that, according to the lawyer of a former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would have needed assurances that he would be "safe" there, said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a "rigid and constant" harassment campaign that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the world's reaction to "his political rhetoric".
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level officials — including in the United States — have found unveiling an uncontrolled surveillance system to be beneficial to society.
The letter offers to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved".
Frontier Airlines will charge for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers for carrying a hand baggage aboard their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers would be able to keep the whole jar.
The new hand luggage charge applies to bags in the upper baggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said she'd charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if the travelers paid only when they arrived at the landing.
The representative of Frontier Kate O'Malley said that a $100 fee should get the passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge for this," she said.
The airlines began charging fees for the first and second bags delivered in the luggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges fill as much as they can into a hand-clothes in the upper baggage compartments, which often lack space in these compartments.
Fees are one way to get passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection isn't really about making money.
The fact is that the most loyal Frontier clients claim that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper baggage compartments.
Passengers who buy airline tickets will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in line at Frontier's flight may be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in line may pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that changing the procedures on the website and at the Frontier registration counters is intended to ensure that passengers will know about the collection before they reach the landing point.
The new Frontier collection for hand luggage will not start to be collected before summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling baggage costs money, and passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges to be a sign that airlines collect enough money to cover the cost of flights after several years of loss.
However, most of them did not deal with hand baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual treasure collection three years ago, and another Allegian Air DVDer later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a collection is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said J. Sorensen's airline consultant, who is closely monitoring the surcharges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the hand luggage fee was $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former headmaster for Midwest Airlines, recently flew a Sprit flight, and he wondered what he would find at the exit when passengers encountered an unusual collection of Spirit for hand luggage.
"The landing process was the smoothest thing I've ever seen in my career in airlines," he said.
I was expecting to see a brush of teeth and a fight at the entrance to the landing.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing went fast."
Frontier also follows Sprit for $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who received soda or juice could keep the entire jar and that coffee would be provided free of charge.
She'll still be handing out free water.
U.S. Airways has been trying to collect drinks for a short time in 2008, but has refused to do so seven months after passengers started complaining and no other major airline followed suit.
The Frontier initiative to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is its last step in attracting customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers like Orbitz from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has given all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than to go to a tourist online agency.
However, Frontier went further than anyone in this area.
In September, she began giving twice as many bonus miles to frequent visitors who bought tickets via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the bonus number of miles to 25 percent of the miles she travelled.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip from Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would provide 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only choose their seats in advance if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal client base in her hometown Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming a loss.
The loan decreased by 9 per cent, and the flight capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to correct Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
NSA blames "internal error," not hackers, for shutting down the site.
The undercover National Security Agency announced on Friday night that the shutting down of their site for a few hours had caused a technical malfunction, not hackers, as alleged online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during the planned update," the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the interruption was caused by a distributed "failure to maintain" [DDoS] attack are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems registered that the NSA site had not been operational for at least six hours, and the site was still not accessible to some users.
The NSA representative previously informed ABC News that the agency's internal secret network "not at all" had been hacked.
No classified information was in danger, the representative said.
At least one online hacker group of activists claimed to be responsible for destroying the NSA website through a DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to cover the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is disabled.
hacker tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to penetrate the target system's internal network.
Previously, the super-secret NSA, once known as "No such Agency", has been at the centre of public attention and intense criticism in recent months, following a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programmes abroad and domestically, all of which are reactions to NSA secret files stolen from the agency and published by a disillusioned former NSA employee, Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the agency has given rise to the fact that today's incident was the result of deliberate action by hackers.
Bombardier's profits are falling with the drop in deliveries and the number of aircraft orders
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net profits on Thursday due to reduced orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems in its railway unit.
The company Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish any flight test data for its newest CSeries, nor did it provide new information on whether ambitious plans to put the aircraft into commercial operation by the next September would be implemented.
After the first flight of a pilot aircraft about a month and a half ago, it flew only three more times, raising questions as to whether the test phase was on schedule.
The results did not meet the projections and resulted in a fall in shares of more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dørksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his rating on Thursday from "above average market" to "average market" because of the belief that stock growth was limited in the next quarter or two.
"Despite the generally predictable decline in the number of aircraft shipments, we are certainly disappointed with the rate of return of the Transport Division," said Dørksen in the stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will allow it to win a seat in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first pilot aircraft was presented in March and first flew in September after several months of delay.
However, the firm orders for CSeries are not yet too high — 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the flight test results to verify the company's fuel efficiency and potential cost-effectiveness of the new liner.
There are now 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Bauduan was confident that Bombardier would reach his goal of 300 firm orders by the time the first plane was launched into commercial operation.
On Thursday, leaders also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward as planned.
"The fixed-wing aircraft model did not stay on the ground longer than expected," said Boduan during the telephone conference, adding that ground testing and software upgrades had been planned for the time of the aircraft's downtime.
All manufacturers plan the tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break for the upgrade, and that's what we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test programme.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks, and the rest will soon follow, as the company has reported.
However, analysts are skeptical of the statement that the first client will be able to operate the CSeries 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier stated that it estimated the date of commissioning and would provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although apparently in line with the Bombardier internal schedule - reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015," said Dørksen.
In the third quarter, which ended on September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted return on the action remained at 9 cents.
Gross income declined slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world ' s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, down from 57 in the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26.
The Portfolio of Orders of the Aerospace Department was $32.9 billion on September 30, without change since December 31.
"In the aerospace field, the results were consistent with our objectives, but the low number of orders received and the general market conditions were a distasteful factor," said Bauduan.
Gross income from aerospace activities fell by 13 per cent, to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train producer, reported that gross income in this sector had increased by almost 11 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
The transport unit's portfolio was $32.6 billion on September 30, which is slightly higher than on December 31.
The revenue of the transport unit was adversely affected by several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's stock, which also announced that Google's chief financial director, Patrick Pichett, would join the board of directors, fell by 8.5 per cent to C $4.83 at a bid in mid-Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world ' s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and close rival Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent decline in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony is counting on a lower annual profit.
The Japanese electronics producer Sony, after completing the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast for the current fiscal year.
Sony ' s results from July to September 2013 were more disappointing than expected, owing to the fall in demand for television, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which in the second quarter brought the company the first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years, fell again to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese market for consumer electronics is going through difficult times, especially because of the declining demand for television.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, Panasonic, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components, where sales of companies are growing at a high rate, especially with car systems and clean technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen in operating profits against the anticipated 230 billion yen previously.
According to Thomson Reuters, however, analysts assumed that the figure would be significantly higher, at 221 billion yen.
In an effort to emerge from the crisis, Sony expands the food line.
In the middle of this month, the sales of smart watches were announced from a Japanese corporation with a number of fashionable functions that would eliminate the need to pull a smartphone 100 times a day out of its pocket.
After Sony reduced its annual profit and revenue forecast, the company lost over 11% of its share in opening the horns in Tokyo in the morning, falling to JPY 1,668 per share.
The speech gene proved to be a catalyst for synapse formation.
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School have discovered a protein that makes Foxp2's "gene of speech" a function that stimulates the formation of new links between neurons.
The study is published in Science and can be found on the magazine's website.
The gene Foxp2 is the first known genome whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 with the discovery of a family of several people who could not speak properly and sometimes even understand one another.
Scientists found that the Foxp2 gene had been disrupted by family members, but how it performed its function was not known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their function is Foxp2 as a catalyst for the formation of new synapses in the speech-related brain.
He's doing it thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of a search for factors that stimulate synapses.
SRPX2 turned out to be one of the 10 genes found by the authors, with only Foxp2 acting on it.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vocalization has been confirmed by scientists in the mice experiment.
When the animal's gene activity was artificially reduced, they screamed less when separated from their mother.
If the gene activity was restored, so was the frequency of the sounds.
Previously, the mice also showed the connection to the Vocalization of Foxp2.
Animals who were injected with a human copy of the gene were more likely to feed at a lower frequency than normal mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether Foxp2 and the SRPX2 it controls relate to the purely mechanical properties of sound generation or to more subtle processes.
A lawyer with cocaine addiction who warned the gang leader about a police investigation is imprisoned.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta passed information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would be exposed.
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Royal Court of Liverpool.
A predatory lawyer who told the drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Ditta transmitted to criminal authority Neil Scarborough secret information on his investigation into drug trafficking after being threatened by his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer named Bash, known among criminals as a "cool lawyer", was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation against Scarborough, which he had previously represented at a drug trial.
Officers noticed that 32-year-old Scarborough left three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's house in Blackburn County, Lancaster, while he was at a bar association dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta had "regularly used" Class A drugs after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
For eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted illegally to obtain information about the arrests of two persons on Scarborough ' s behalf, as well as of one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were at that time under police surveillance as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of the criminal organization selling heroin and cocaine in Lancastire, Kambria, Mercisaid, Burkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and over £200,000 in cash in a series of raids.
42-year-old Ditta was passing information on to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today, in the Riverpool Royal Court of Ditt, which works for the Forbes Solicitos Law Company, located in Blackburn, was disgraced after finding him guilty in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at the Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to possession of cocaine at a previous trial.
The lawyer ' s disclosure came after Scarborough ' s investigation police found out that he had regularly spoken to Diet on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found him walking up to Ditt's house in Blackburn and putting 60 percent pure drugs in a black golf glove under a lawyer's trash drawer.
Shortly after Scarborough's transfer, he had multiple calls with Ditt, who was at dinner at the Iwood Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court learned that Ditta had "regularly used" cocaine after the tests found traces of a Class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, said he was talking to a suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication constituted a "lawyer secret".
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but all were confiscated and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he said that, along with his workplace, he had a home office and his clients came to his house on legal matters.
However, the Court learned that, after important arrests, it had called the largest drug traffickers, a number of whom he had previously represented in court to tell them that detectives knew about them.
In an indictment speech, Anne White said, "If anyone knows they shouldn't break the law, it's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he has had too close relations with certain clients.
The contact we're talking about isn't just a drug dealer, it's a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will certainly prove to be legitimate because he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the normal relationship between counsel and client.
He prevented the police investigation as much as possible from continuing their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but embarrassed it.
He was too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, to question his lack of interest.
Ditta pleaded not guilty and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer I wasn't, and I wanted to give Mr. Scarborough information, I wouldn't have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Halstead of the Lancaster police said, "Mr. Ditta became a criminal lawyer as soon as he started buying drugs from organized crime."
His addiction to cocaine has made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the main participants in criminal groups, who have instructed him to extract valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire public confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover his profession.
The investigation of Mr. Ditt was led by a particularly dangerous organized crime unit in Lancaster, which has already reached his verdict in three cases of cocaine possession and now also in obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire to obtain a fair punishment for the perpetrators.
Let this case warn criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was convicted for 14 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the fraud were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related offences.
On his website, Ditta arranged a question-and-answer session in which he says that the work of his dream is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the ideal partner for him at dinner is Mohammed Ali, and motivation in his work is inequality.
The stadium in Jaroslavla is not ready to receive 22,000 viewers, and police officers who were present today at the meeting of the Russian Federation CDC.
The ticket programme was, in their view, about twice as high.
During the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup with Spartacus, only a thousand flight attendants were involved under the nine thousand rule.
Spartakov fans were given 2,200 seats, 10 percent of the stadium's capacity, but were sold 5,000 tickets by agreement with the Moscow Club.
Arthur Grigoriantz, head of the CDC, read this information.
Americans eavesdropping on Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, 1 November, a representative of the American intelligence services, who chose not to reveal his name, stated that the States were listening to telephone calls from high-ranking Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that there are several audition points in the rising sunland.
He noted, however, that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand did not engage in intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during the Second World War, when those countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, in spite of allied relations with Americans in the post-war period, is the target of intelligence activities, reporting to NHK.
No official comment has yet been received from either party.
Let's remind you, the news of the U.S. intelligence surveillance of the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany came out last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to tap Merkel's phone for the last 10 years.
The Chancellor herself, according to some accounts, took the news of her wiretap very painfully.
She stated that the allies she believed were the FRG and the US for decades, and that such surveillance of the head of government was unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden stated that he was willing to share details about the telephone conversations of Angela Merkel with German prosecutors.
The German specifically flew to Moscow to meet a former CIA employee.
Bashkiri can tender the grain not before the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria, in the course of public procurement interventions, may tender the grain not before the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic, Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not encourage sales into the intervention fund.
As long as the market price is higher, it's demand.
"Perhaps the grain will be tendered after New Year's Eve," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that the current year ' s crop crop cultivation for 2013 was 3.1 million hectares, of which 1.7 million hectares were cereals, an increase of 3.3 per cent over the previous year.
In 2014, 550,000 hectares were planted (by 105,000 hectares more than in 2012).
The area has been increased to winter wheat and tritical, and the birth has remained at the same level.
There is no "Brat Circle" group in the Ministry of Internal Affairs bases that Leps was assigned to in the United States.
In the databases of Russian silovists of the Bratt Circle, to which Washington assigned the singer Gregory Leps, there is no record.
According to Interfax in the Russian Federation's law enforcement agencies, all databases have been checked after reports of the U.S. Treasury Department's listing of Gregory Leps on the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brat Circle", but no such group has been found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia", which allegedly operates abroad, is regarded in the security forces.
"Even in the name itself, 'Brat Circle', there's an element of mystery, there's a hint of a secret bed.
"It's all very much like a PR campaign," said the agency's interviewer.
On October 31, the U.S. Treasury announced that it had placed on its control lists suspected of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brat Circle" of Arthur Badalan, Gregory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lalinn, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalski and Igor Schlykov.
The individuals on the list are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who have been considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on US sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Gregory Leps is "a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev".
At the producer's center, Gregory Leps refused to comment on the US accusations against the singer, calling them "delusional."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama designated the Brad Circle syndicate as "significant transnational organized crime groups" and instructed the Minfin to "fight and prohibit their global criminal operations".
The blacklisting of an American mine has the effect of freezing its assets in the United States and banning business contacts with people living in the United States.
Scandal video went to the police.
Toronto's head, Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and blatantly reckless stunts, got caught smoking crack.
The Canadian city police said they had a video and were ready to launch an investigation against the town chief.
He stated that he would not leave his post, reporting to CNN.
Information that the authorities had evidence of drug use by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto police website.
Bill Blair, the head of local law enforcement, held a press conference on the subject.
The sheriff said that he was not authorized to share these personnel with the public, but that he was responsible for their existence.
According to Blair, the compromising Rob Ford video was discovered during an anti-drug raid conducted by the guards in the summer of 2013.
Previously, the Canadian press had written about the existence of the video, but until recently there had been no confirmation.
The mayor himself makes no comment on this matter.
He's just saying it's not his fault and he's not gonna resign.
The video footage found by the police is one of the evidence in the case of a 35-year-old friend, Ford Alexander Lisi, accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illegal proceeds, and criminal conspiracy.
Lisi sometimes acted as Rob Ford's driver.
The people of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He fought journalists on several occasions, appeared in public in a drunken manner, allowed himself to be racist and sexist.
The Rostovaeroinvest recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender chosen by the project's genetic designer.
The contract amount at Rostovaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the UAO press service, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, and according to the terms of the tender, the project is to be prepared and sent to the State expert examination in spring 2014.
The winner will have to design a new airport passenger terminal as well as infrastructure facilities, inland roads and airport upgrading elements.
In the first phase of construction, the internal area of the terminal will be 50,000 square metres, and may be increased thereafter.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the design documents will take into account the prospects of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and by 2035 6 million passengers.
By the time the outcome of the tender was completed, the architectural concept of the South air station complex, developed by Twelve Architects, a British company, had been established.
The main terminal project embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Donu and other cities in the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience with major projects, and the company designed terminals C and E of Sheremetevo International Airport and a new air station complex at Knewiwiwich International Airport in Vladivostok.
The South International Airport complex will be built in the Aksay district of Rostov oblast and will replace the existing growth of the airport, which will be closed down and eventually integrated into urban development.
Construction of the air station complex is scheduled to begin in 2014, with the entry of all facilities in 2017.
A politician in Turkey went on a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria.
In mid-October, the authorities began construction of the separation wall in the area of Nusaybin town in south-east Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the PMD Pro-Kurdish Party have spoken out against the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish town of Nusaybin Ayshe Hekhan, on the border with Syria, went on hunger strike to protest against the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border and reported to RIA News in the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PFM) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly dispersed protests.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muammer Güler, first denied the construction, then stated that the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"The Mayor of Nusaybina Ayeshe Hekhan, a member of the PDP, went on hunger strike, turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," said the party's press service.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries from each other, and the Kurds have crossed the border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhuman situation that the Kurdishs will never accept," is quoted by Ayeshe Hekhan of the party's representatives.
According to the press service, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is scheduled to take place in Nusaybin on 7 November.
Venezuela will set a rate of exchange for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, the Bolívara, against the dollar for tourists.
On 1 November, Bloomberg reported this with reference to a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange the equivalent of 10,000 US dollars a year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the bolívares acquired in the country at the time of departure.
The specific rate of bolívar against the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolívares per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolívares.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 per cent.
On 18 October, the Minister of Petroleum Industry and Vice-President of the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, stated that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the Bolívar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to depreciate the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
Policies to contain the prices of products and goods of high consumption, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, have led to a shortage of a number of products and the operation of the black exchange market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
The director of Southra, Andrei Belmach, noted that it was difficult to tell how long it would take to find a new chief coach.
This post became vacant following the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so to tell you how long it would take to find a new coach, I'm not ready, I'm telling you ITAAR-TASS the words of Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're looking at all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
It's not just to find some coach, it's someone who's gonna work at our club for a few years and get some results.
The Kenyan press is outraged by the provocative media law
"This is a terrible place, and there is reason to ask: What can Parliament prevent the independence of the judiciary from being destroyed in the future?" reported the newspaper, calling the law unconstitutional.
"This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of the Capital Group, a parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said that the new media judiciary "will always be biased, as it is a continuation of government", and content and advertising restrictions will harm Kenya's global economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return it to the deputies," he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially allow the government to "take the media with a dead grip," and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "received a serious blow" and criticized the bill as "draconian".
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at Westgate Trade Center.
The Kenyan media provoked anger on the part of the authorities by broadcasting surveillance cameras, where the troops who were sent to the scene of the attack allegedly robbed an expensive shopping centre.
The reaction of police chief David Kimayo was to summon two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was cancelled following mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, with an additional risk of being "delisted", i.e. prohibited from obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender ' s property if the fine is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM radio stations.
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called live blogosphere.
Politicians realize that by silence, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote National Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenyan media as a key source of restraint and balance in public life.
"The politicians themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.
Kenya's legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to abolish the cuts appointed by the National Wages Commission and to restore their huge salary of about 532,000 shillings per month, which is tax-free, one of the highest in the world.
There will be a new line of expenditure in the Voroners ' utility payments, which will be paid for major repairs to the house.
The best estimate for a standard two-room apartment is 100 to 400 roubles per month from the new year.
The Government of the region will determine the exact standard.
But when you paint the entrance, you fix the stairwells, or even replace the elevator, it's up to the tenants to decide.
Such a law was approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klavnikov, Chairman of the Voronezhsky Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, too, it will be necessary to establish order - to prioritize the renovation of houses, to accumulate funds not in the governing companies - which we often register in Moscow, or in Orenburg, or elsewhere, it will be to establish State control over the expenditure of funds that residents collect for the renovation of apartment buildings."
Under the control of the State, it is now joint construction.
The law protecting against fraud was approved by a clutter in final reading.
The document wasn't born empty.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people have been affected by unfair developers.
Most of the problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and obligations for all those involved in the construction.
Vladimir Klavnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, stated: "It is no secret that abuses have also started in this area because the shareholders were the same in 98 and the same in the 2000s."
People started making money to cover the loophole, including by adopting these two laws.
It was decided to build a temporary stay centre under Voronezhe for foreign nationals subject to deportation.
The Regional Parliament had passed such a law not only under federal pressure.
The problems associated with irregular migrants in the region are even better.
In the past year, for example, a little over 100,000 foreigners had entered the migration register.
But only one in five has a formal work permit.
Where the rest work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klavnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said, "They have violated the law but are not criminals."
There's no trial, and we have to deport them. We have to keep them somewhere.
Such a decision was taken by the Federation that, through regional means, such places should be equipped.
In the Voronezh region, this is the Old Olshank of the Semiluk District.
Well, last but not least, the regional parliament has granted new benefits to parents with many children.
First, families raising 5 or more children are completely exempt from transport tax.
In this case, the budget loses 3.5 million, but so do parents with many children.
Secondly, and above all, those who adopt three or more babies will be granted housing subsidies from a new year.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at a cost of 30,000 per metre.
For example, a family of six — the father, the mother, the child, and the third — were adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the State purchases 108 square metres of housing for 3 million 300 thousand roubles.
For the left bank or the southwest neighbourhood, it's an acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage at the Ridge Center for that amount.
Baumgertner nominated for board of directors of Uralcalya.
The current board of directors of the UAO, Uralkaly, has proposed the candidate of Director-General Vladislav Baumgertner, arrested in Minsk, for the new board, and is posted on the website of the Russian company.
Bamugertner joined the list of 11 persons nominated for the new board of directors.
The list was prepared for the extraordinary shareholders ' assembly on 29 November, which will determine the new composition of the board by vote.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
At the time of his arrest in August of this year, he was charged with abuse of authority.
However, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenka, later stated at a press conference that the charges against Baumgertner had been reclassified to "theft".
Gateman Matt Dalton refused to comment on Vladimir Crickunov's departure from his position as a mentor to the Lower Rockers.
The Golkyper believes that Acting Chief Coach Dmitri Balmin has a great deal of authority among the players and will be able to handle his duties.
Let's remind you, the oil chemist retired Creekunov today.
To be honest, I wouldn't like to comment on Vladimir Crickunov's dismissal, quote Dalton RIA News.
All I can say is that Dmitri Balmin can handle his responsibilities, which I have no doubt about.
On the team, he has a great deal of authority, and this young expert certainly has a big future ahead of him.
Leonardo Bonucci, a member of the Juventus, won't help the team in the next Italian match with Parma.
According to Football Italia, the coach's office decided not to include it in the game to save it before the fourth round of the League of Real Champions.
Nor will they compete with Parma Lichtsteiner, Vucinich and Pepe.
And Forward Fabio Quallarella recovered from the trauma and is ready to play.
A tax manoeuvre that includes an increase in the oil tax (NPI) would lead to an increase in fuel while lowering export duties and increasing excises.
In the view of the experts, these measures could add an additional 619.3 billion roubles to the budget.
The President of the Krasnoyarsk Court had his I.D. stolen and hit him on the head.
The unknown attacked the President of the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court, Vladimir Dwukonko, by stealing his identity card.
According to Interfax, late Wednesday night, the perpetrators hit the judge in the head and lost consciousness.
When the 63-year-old president came to his senses, he found that he had been removed from his service card.

The Interregional Exhibition of Medicine and Health opened in Ivanov
The Interregional Exhibition of Medicine and Health 2013 opened at the Olympic Sports and Entertainment Complex.
Olga Hasbulatova, First Vice-President of the Government of the Ivanov region, participated in the opening of the event.
The exhibition presents the work of the regional health-care budget institutions of the Ivanovsk region and the commercial health-care institutions of the regions of Central Russia.
The exhibition will include seminars, round tables, presentations.
The exhibition includes a mobile complex (full diagnostics), a mobile fluorograph and a blood transfusion station.
All interested will be able to obtain free diagnostic procedures, specialist counselling, a master class in physical education, and a range of services provided in the treatment facilities in the Ivanov region.
In addition, there is a donor's day during the exhibition.
The general concept of the exhibition " Medicine and Health 2013 " is a preventive approach to medicine and the promotion of healthy lifestyles.
The exhibition presents medical goods and services, equipment, pharmaceuticals and medicines that improve the quality of life.
The main activities of the exhibition were: to develop cooperation with producers and suppliers of medical equipment in the Ivanovsk region and in the regions of Russia; to demonstrate medical goods and services, equipment, pharmaceuticals and medicines that improve the quality of life; and to establish business contacts between health-care institutions in the Ivanov region.
U.S. Secretary of State: intelligence agencies have sometimes gone too far in data collection
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that American intelligence agencies sometimes went "too far" in data collection and wiretaps, but the politician pointed out that the news about the wiretapping of 70 million people was not accurate.
I assure you that innocent people were not injured in this process, but the attempt to gather information was.
Yes, in some cases this has gone too far and was not lawful.
I admit it, as the president also admits... and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future," quote Secretary of State AFP.
Italian workers with seniority give way to young people
Italian unemployment beats records.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5 per cent of the population were now unemployed.
This has not been the case since the Second World War.
Among young people, the rate is several times higher.
40.4 per cent of the population between the ages of 15 and 24 are unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
The country ' s largest energy company is already carrying out such an experiment, and the laws that have been adopted allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for long-term employees.
On the other hand, Italy faces a common European problem of ageing populations.
And economists aren't sure that an early rotation will justify itself.
This will result in the construction of TPU in Moscow
Every year, the capital authorities promise to build more and more transport and transport hubs (TAPs).
It is planned to put 255 TAPs into operation before 2020.
What the project actually turns out to be, our reporter was looking into it.
A couple of months ago, the Smolenne subway of the Arbatsko-Pokrov line had a construction fence.
The inscription stated that a transport hub was under construction.
This was all very strange, as no ground transport stops near Smolen and therefore cannot be moved to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you have to cross about 130 meters, including the ground crossing of the Carmanice alley.
Now, Smolen's almost done.
The flower bar has disappeared, the newspaper stand has been dismantled, and the asphalt has been replaced by a tarpaulin at the entrance.
There's the whole transport hub.
Transport and transport facilities can be flat and capital, as explained by the Press Service of the Metropolitan Transport Department.
There's no capital TVU yet.
And the flats involve parking, the withdrawal of commercial facilities that hinder passenger movement, the creation of small architectural forms, and the improvement of structures.
In fact, it is not even transporters who handle flat TPVs, but professionals from the Moscow Capital Renovation Department.
The transport hub, which is not necessarily a complex design, explains the director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics, Michael Blinkin.
Sometimes there are enough roofs and placards to indicate the time of arrival.
For example, the Jasenevo subway has recently opened a fully-fledged flat-plane transfer Node.
I don't care if there's any curtains, but there's a lot of parking and signposts to indicate when the bus is coming.
But in pursuit of the number, the officials record everything in the TVU.
As early as 2011, the City Hall planned to build all 151 knots, 59 of them with capital construction.
The plans for 2020 now include 255 TAPs.
One and a half of them are gonna give up this year.
Although the city has a programme for the development of TSS, there are no qualitative criteria, Alexander Morosov, co-chair of City and Transport.
They report on the number of objects, but the quality of transplants on each of them often deteriorates.
The criteria, in the expert ' s view, should be two: first, reduced transplant time; secondly, comfort.
First of all, the possibility of changing the mode of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, however, the TPU sometimes comes out exactly the opposite.
That's a good example of the subway.
The suburban buses from the Jaroslav Highway used to come to the Square in front of the main entrance to the OCE.
Now they've moved their stops to the opposite side of Jaroslavka to Cosmonaut Street.
Far from the subway, far further from the monorail, but closer to the homes.
It's a gift that residents didn't want the bus station under the windows and complained to every possible authority.
The capital TPU in Moscow didn't start at all.
The first one started building five years ago at the Planner subway.
The project was meant to be exemplary.
And there's a really good example of how a transfer knot that's been bought out to investors turns into a platoon mall.
No, there's bus pens, a curtain to avoid walking from the subway in the rain, and three floors of the parking lot.
However, the number 202 and number 203 trolleybuses in Moscow's TPI did not have a place in principle.
They've been moved away from the subway like strangers.
But there are more places to trade.
There's only 32 store clothes, and there's almost all of them, from the zootowers to the auto salon.
Well, really, what if one of the passengers on the bus needs to buy a new car on the road?
We've always got a mall when we're building a capital TSS.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion when part of the parking lot decided to market.
Now, on the third floor of the "Planner" TAP, there is a brute trade among the semi-parked parking spaces.
Vegetables, spice, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech, and security guards, looking evil at our photographer.
The transfer node has finally turned into a bazaar.
The thing is, the Planner subway used to have a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, the traders felt sorry and were allowed to go to the overtaking parking lot of a transfer node.
It's always empty because of the high prices.
The funny thing is, the market was destroyed in order to build a new flat TCU.
That's the rocking.
At the Kaluga metro, the distance from the subway lobby to the bus was 50 metres, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the mall, allegedly TPU increased the distance to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the mall.
After 22 hours when it's closed, you have to go around it in the open.
However, the designs on Planner and Kaluga are about to look like flowers.
In mid-September, the Town Hall Urban and Land Commission approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TAPs.
Four of them will be 25-story, apart from two or three underground tiers.
The main monster will grow up on the Tushino subway, with 418.7 thousand square metres of space.
The representatives of the RZR railway station directorate responsible for the construction of TPVs by the subway have already told journalists: shops, hotels and apartments will be available in the future.
In doing so, the officials assure us that the multi-tiered parking is between one third and one half of the square.
Take the "people" garages as an example.
Let's say the 258 car garage that was recently built on International Street has an area of 8015 square metres.
So it's going to take about 80,000 quadrants to park for 2,600 cars.
That's less than a third of the machine they're going to build there.
Let's have one or two floors of bus perforates.
There are at least 150,000 square metres of commercial property left.
And this, for a minute, is almost two GUMs.
If railway trains are built at stations and stations, the remaining sites will be developed by the metropolitan population.
They also promised that there would be many "functional objects", including hotels, offices, and even gymnasiums.
By the way, the Moscow Property Department recently told journalists that it was drafting a regulation that would allow investors to apply directly to officials for a TPU site.
No contests.
'Cause, you know, transport issues are a priority for the city.
The ideal TSS is, for example, Harvard stations in Boston or Spadeina in Toronto, I'm sure Alexander Morosov.
There the trolleybuses and trams go underground to the subway level and the distance from the subway wagon to the tram is only 50 metres without going to the street.
There's no extra trade around here.
But Moscow's officials are out of line.
Either we don't build anything, or we're gonna tear down 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser proposes to treat extremism as an affront to patriotic feelings.
In order to protect the patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, Justice Russia proposes that the insult of patriotic feelings should be equated with extremist activities and punished for five years in prison.
According to the newspaper Izvestia, such legislative amendments, prepared by Oleg Miheyev, a deputy to the Doum Committee on Energy, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and to the Government for an opinion.
By patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to mean an emotional relationship between a person and the country of which he is a national, characterized by love for that country, responsibility for its fate, respect for its history and culture.
According to Miheev, domestic legislation contains sanctions for abuse of the formal features of State authority - flag and coat of arms.
In the view of the parliamentarian, however, the protection of Russians whose feelings may be hurt and insulted by State symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country is not sufficiently developed in Russian law.
By way of example, he cited the debate that was taking place every year on the eve of Victory Day, when some media figures were allowing themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the struggle against fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday, the Victory Day of May 9th, the real Wachanalia is taking place every year.
By practicing wit and "alternate view" of history, some publicists have come to think that it is a shame that the German culture did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I find this totally unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "soul-stamped" nation, which is outraged by Oleg Miheev.
Moreover, according to Miheev, patriotic people in Russia are far more numerous than religious ones, but the law punishes those who insult the feelings of the believers and insult patriotic feelings with almost impunity.
In the opinion of the people ' s elector, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activities and to prescribe appropriate penalties in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for penalties for insulting patriotic feelings, ranging from a fine of 100 to five years ' imprisonment.
The 6.6 magnitude earthquake occurred on Thursday, 31 October, near the town of Coquimbo in central Chile, and is being transmitted by Reuters.
The quake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometres and 54 kilometres south-west of the city, as explained by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The shocks were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 on 1 November in Moscow).
No casualties or subterranean shocks have yet been reported.
Again, Chile is located in one of the most seismic regions of the world, so earthquakes are not uncommon.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
At that time, the 8.8 earthquake and the tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history, with 9.5 magnets recorded there in 1960.
More than 5,000 people died as a result of that natural disaster.
Dmitri Beardev: Greenpeace will be heard fairly
The Russian Prime Minister, Dmitrymedev, announced on Friday that the Greenpeace case would be dealt with in strict compliance with Russian law.
France can be sure that the case will be dealt with in accordance with the law, and we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee respect for the law," said Dmitri Medvedev at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero.
There is a French citizen among the detainees of Greenpeace activists.
Pierre Pizan, like other activists, is charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quotes Mr. Ero's RIA News.
"Our country cannot support activities that are likely to harm the environment, no one is entitled to violate the law," Dmitrimedev stated.
He said that any structures that tried to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy extraction, were dangerous.
He stressed that these objects "like a powder keg" and recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, were transmitting RIA News.
UN sets new targets for poverty reduction
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing "sustainable development goals" to replace the 2015 MDGs before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro the previous evening.
They were included in the final version of the document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit the previous evening that it was now time to "be above national interests".
"I am pleased that UN member countries have agreed to launch and monitor the process of establishing the universal sustainable development goals — SDGs", he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will make every effort to use the authority given to me by member countries to translate our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the successful achievement of the MDGs.
Concerns about security in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
At the top of the statue of Samara Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant peace slogans at one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for her country's future, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt decorated with the inscription "We Demand Security" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd in the capital Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo have been one of the most brutal clashes since the truce was concluded more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa in the apartheid era, as part of an effort to destabilize the country ' s independent Government.
After the 1992 truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to a full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge shelf reserves of gas and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy, and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Fremmo Party, a leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo Party accuse each other of creating tension.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government was the mastermind of the recent clashes, attacking its members in Sofala province, Renamo ' s traditional stronghold, on 17 October.
Attacks on former rebels then intensified when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, reported to the Financial Times, Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renamo.
The government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Gebusa tried to dispel fears of instability.
Gebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt "unlucky" who wanted to use "all that was left of his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government".
Both Fremmo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears have increased following reports that Mazanga has declared Renamo ' s rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he was referring to Fremmo's non-compliance.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tensions that have been exacerbated by the series of clashes this year.
"These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakama) who have bumped into their foreheads," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiators and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
The share of votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which was founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who was due to resign next year when his second term ended, wished to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is not clear what Renemo is capable of, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.
Most of the clashes took place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Bayra, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railway tracks for about a week after Renemo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that Mozambique is not doing well," said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the government's frustration, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent increase in kidnapping, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
"People think that responsibility for the future of the country lies with the Government and the President, who must find a solution to these problems," he says.
Omar Sultan, a protestor, said that people simply wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Fremmo, they just want peace to resume, they want free access to roads," he said.
The Art Mainstream premiere series will take place in Moscow.
The film series "Art Mainstream", where the viewers will be able to see one Russian film and four foreign films a few days before their release, will take place at the Rolan cinema from 1 to 5 November, reporting to RIA News with reference to the project's organizers.
Opens the Art Mainstream program to the French comedy director and actress Reim Kerichi, Paris at all costs.
This is the story of the French capital's Maya model (Kerichi's own), which is being deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi's film, viewers will also be shown a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Doek "Mibius" and the melodramatical biopic Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: a story of love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts as lead and lead film of the May Cannes Film Festival "Living Adele" by Abdelaltif Keshish.
The only Russian member of Art Mainstream will be Alexander Veledinsky's film, "Geographing the Globe" for the same novel by Alexey Ivanov.
The film featured Konstantin Habensky, a charming failure teacher, who was also awarded the "Cinautaur" prize.
Children should learn myths and legends as "models of way of life," says the author.
The Torah could show that "brutal power cannot defeat sophisticated tricks," and legends about King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
To say that many myths will be "too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too indecent to be taught in schools", Crossley-Holland advocates "study selection" of age-appropriate texts.
"I think it's wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I advocated their introduction into the curriculum for 20 years.
He added that "excessive moralism" by authors and teachers "disturbed" children, and the basic ideas were "sublime" in fascinating stories.
Crossley Holland, who translated "Beowulf" from the English-Saxon language and wrote "Norwegian Myth Collection" for Penguin and "British People's Tales", said, "You may have intentions, but you better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps a great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but that there should be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And that should be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly articulated.
It's an old principle to show, not tell.
In the Voronezh region, a football fan was detained, breaking a window in the waiting room at the train station.
At 9 p.m. on 29 October, two football fans from the Moscow region were removed from the passenger train by the transport police at the station of Grozi-Voronezh.
On their way to the game of their favorite team, the guys were on the way to a drunken train bastard.
The young men were taken to the on-call section of the Liner Police Unit at the Dirty Station to draw up a report on the administrative offence.
There the fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
The police put administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets to the next train and began to wait for him at the station station.
At half the first night, fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke the front door window of the train station waiting room with his foot.
An officer of the transport police and a guard of the CDC "RZD" rang the broken glass.
They managed to apprehend the perpetrator who was trying to escape the scene.
The officers of the South-East LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation are conducting an inspection.
The question of the institution of criminal proceedings is under consideration, and a senior referee of the communication and public relations of the South-East LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation on the transport of Sergei Olkhovik.
Vitaly Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we've been back 15 years.
The Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutko, expressed his opinion on the riots on the stands during the Russian Cup match Shinnick, Spartacus.
I'm in favour of being held accountable by the organizers of sports events: clubs, leagues, the Russian Federation.
But we can see that they're taking a different position.
They're waiting for someone from the outside to come and clean up.
It's a very good position, but it's not quite the right one.
We have to organize the fans, the clubs have to invite their flight attendants, not let the case go.
We have now drawn up a special government regulation on the rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it's accepted, we'll take care of it.
But I'm gonna have to invite all the football organizers to join me.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, give the law quickly.
It's like they're Bavaria fans in Jaroslavl and they're all doing it.
We're outsiders.
In fact, it's awful to see the stand water from the firewall.
And it's in a country that's preparing for the World Cup.
"I feel like we're back 10, 15 years," said Mutko.
Snowden can be questioned in Russia.
A former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden is likely not to travel outside Russia to testify on the German Chancellor Angela Merkel telephone calls.
As the Interfax said to a source familiar with the situation on Friday, an American can answer questions from representatives of the German Attorney General's Office in writing or in private in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure outside Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by U.S. allies," said the agency's interviewee.
"At the same time, in principle, the General Secretariat of the Federal Republic of Germany could send representatives to the Russian Federation or refer written questions to Snowden", the source added, adding that the matter should be developed at the inter-State level.
Previously, a German Bundestag deputy, Hans-Cristian Schtrebele, reported that Edward Snowden was willing to testify in the German Chancellor's wiretapping case.
Snowden is ready to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or on German territory.
A CIA ex made it clear that he knows a lot.
Although the U.S. NSA has blocked all of his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, all the conditions for his arrival must be clearly defined," reported Schtrebele to Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement of Interfax's source, stated that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide.
A U.S. citizen, Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he released information about U.S. intelligence operations on the Internet.
Snowden was in transit through Moscow, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport was cancelled by the United States authorities, who made serious allegations in absentia, and remained in the transit area of Sheremetievo Airport until the beginning of August.
On 1 August, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum on Russian territory for a period of one year and left Sheremetievo on the same day.
Yesterday, an American lawyer Anatoly Kucheren stated that his client had taken a job in a "large Russian company".
The NSA's surveillance of Angela Merkel was reported last week by German media.
According to journalists, the chancellor's phone calls began to be auditioned as early as 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly located at the United States Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after publishing the information, stated that the surveillance of Merkel violated German law and sovereignty.
Ponomarev left Justice Russia.
A member of the State Duma from the Justice Russia Party, a member of its office in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, filed an application for withdrawal from a political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he filed an application with the party ' s Novo-Siberian regional office.
According to its statute, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of "justices".
We're sitting here drinking tea...
"Why do many want to see the painting "Ilya Ponomarev puts on the table, but there is nothing so landmark about it," the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintained a good relationship with the Regional Office of the Esers.
However, Ilya Ponomarev, a member of the State Duma, has no intention of relinquishing his mandate.
He explained that, despite his withdrawal from the party, he remained a member of the faction and could not legally leave the party.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the Fair Russia party appeared on 30 October.
Dmitri Houdkov and Valery Zubov were reported to be coming out of "SR" with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss the conclusion of a peace treaty with Russia
The head of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Fumio Kisida, met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of the political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," said Kisida at the meeting.
Japan ' s Foreign Minister recalled that since Japan ' s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had visited Russia, relations between countries had become warmer and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation would meet Japan on complex political issues, writing RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today to demand that the land lost after the Second World War be restored to the country.
There are cars in the Japanese capital that say, "Return the northern territory!"
The police don't stop the protesters, they make sure they don't exceed the noise level.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
You can safely say that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the singer Frank Faye, who worked as a conferenceist at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Faye's innovation has in time been picked up by others, just recently by the New York comedy festival.
Created and sponsored by Caroline Hersch, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"The majority of these headliners started at Carolines, and then made more progress, reached a level when they were already too famous to perform at the club," Hursch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Cathy Griffin and Bill Mar, as well as "Stendup for Heroes", an annual music and comedy charity concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, which will feature Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy expanded.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival became popular in a non-traditional way, for example through a show on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was famous for playing in a comedy show on a little-known cable television channel (punctured a FXX scavenger "League" on the theme of fantasy football), and now runs his own sketch show on comedy central.
Jenny Slate joined the cast both on Saturday night live and on Parks and Rest Zones, although it is best known in the series of viral videos "Marsel - the shell in the boots".
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians in their own style (surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, a wicked, racially focused Camau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but then became a successful television director and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy" with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in the center of Manhattan.
"This city is certainly the centerpiece of Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walked around some street between the two houses and thought, "If I don't have any money, maybe I'll live here."
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy in the United Kingdom, where Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan is visiting.
The Head of Government of Pakistan made a statement on talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Vice-Prime Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister reported that the dialogue with the Taliban had begun," states the statement of the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
- He said he hoped and prayed that dialogue would work in accordance with Pakistan's constitution," the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement but operate independently in the north-west regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are working to establish an Islamic State.
Earlier, the Government of Islamabad had attempted to enter into negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement had refused to engage in dialogue.
It stated that it would negotiate only if the authorities took troops deployed in the Taliban areas to permanent locations and also released the arrested Islamists from prison.
Navaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil's down to $96 a barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about the formation of large reserves were eclipsed by a report showing that China's energy-intensive manufacturing sector was gaining momentum.
The US reference oil in the December shipment was 14 cents, with a price of $96.24 per barrel later this morning in European time in electronic bidding at the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract was 39 cents, which represented a 5.8 per cent drop in the October price.
The wealth of oil has affected its cost in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy announced on Wednesday that US reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels have been added.
But on Friday, there was a reference to a possible increase in demand, based on two reports of Chinese industry showing a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China ' s economic recovery may continue to gain momentum after the third quarter ' s growth rate rose to 7.8 per cent after the twenty-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Brent's oil is the reference international oil type used by the United States oil refineries as well, and has been cheaper by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the London Intercontinental Exchange.
Chief Coach "Colorado" Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release the Golkyper Semen Varlamov from the first minute on Friday's match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars had not shaken his confidence in the Russian, transmitting from Dallas "S.E." Natalia Schmelev.
What do we have to wait for, Rue said after the morning roll of Lavin?
Of course, what has happened concerns us all, but we are confident of it and feel that it will be useful for him to get on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you're pretty sure the situation hasn't affected the gatekeeper's condition?
We'll see about that today.
There is no doubt that our players will support Varli by helping him guard the gate, as was the case in previous games of this season.
The important thing is that no one on the team is going to draw any conclusions until this situation is resolved by the court.
In Siberia, you shouldn't be a vegan: a warm tomato won't replace a soup.
Why vegetarianism isn't suitable for living in Siberia, RIA News reporter found out.
People who have completely abandoned animal food should not live in Siberia.
They will not be able to survive the winter without loss to health, and no greenhouse tomatoes will compensate them, as the New Siberian nutritionists and doctors interviewed on the eve of Vegan Day view.
Drink butter in litres
Strict vegetarianism, where not only meat and fish are abandoned, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable lifestyle.
However, dietologists believe that in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia, maintaining such strict nutritional standards is not at least healthy.
Total abandonment of animal food is harmful.
Animal proteins contain indispensable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate with plant acids.
You have to put milk or eggs in the diet," nutritionist Marina Bogai is sure.
She gives an example of fish containing the indispensable fatty acid Omega-3.
His richest vegetable oil is linen oil.
"In order to consume it in the quantities necessary for a human being, you have to drink in litres!" says the nutritionist.
Medical doctors believe that the people of Siberia need to pay special attention to the diet in the winter.
This season, vegetarianism is particularly called into question.
In our realities, food requirements are high.
It takes more calories to keep it cold.
"If a person limits himself to animal products, therefore, he misses this calorie," says a specialist.
Olga Pozniak, a nutritionist, agrees.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not the answer.
It is better for a person to eat mainly food that is grown in the region or where he was born.
The genetic code is oriented towards better learning and digestion of these products.
In the winter, people want to eat a hot soup or something nicer," the doctor explains his position.
According to her, from what vegans can eat, it's really useful to have different grains, porridges, beans, local vegetables, apples remaining in the winter, frozen berries.
But that is clearly not enough to feed.
According to the gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, the vitamin levels in the body were sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
The complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural environment, where the temperature can change by 30 degrees in 24 hours and the snow is lying in May, is not appropriate.
The body needs energy to live, and this is above all fat," the medic says.
Doctors note that veganism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And by sticking to vegetarianism, we give them to the inferiors.
Pregnant women also need increased protein, vitamins, and micronutrients on the menu.
"The vegans don't get them," I'm sure.
Arifulina says that a grown man is free to choose whatever he wants, "play those toys he wants."
He's got a formed body, a skeleton, organs.
And yet, children must eat fully.
If his parents deprive him of any micronutrients or amino acids, choosing what he'll eat for him, it's just a violation of a child's rights.
"The lack of any substance for the development of the brain, the eyes, the bones will never be restored tomorrow," she says.
All the medical specialists interviewed agree on the poor quality of the winter growing in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains less of the micronutrients we need than it does in the open soil.
"The quality of the food is wrong," says the God.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
At times, the desire of producers to collect more crops is detrimental to quality.
"Apples do not become brown on the cut, cucumbers quickly yellow and mold, tomatoes tasteless and non-aromatic," gives examples of medics, adding that they are likely to be filled with excessive fertilizer.
And they become suppliers not of vitamins, but of fibers.
This is not in agreement with the Cybira Institute of Agrarian Physics and Technology, a candidate for agricultural science, Vera Petruk.
She said that full-scale vegetables could be grown in greenhouses with the right approach and compliance with all standards and requirements.
If we try to kick more from a square metre, we will, of course, water more often, and feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grew rapidly, they were large but watery and unweak," she explained, adding that quality was primarily a matter of conscience for the manufacturer.
The Court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of "stop-and-search" at the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes in the "stop-and-search" programme of the New York Police Department and suspended the judge from the case.
The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeal stated that the execution of Judge Shira Sheindlin ' s decisions would be suspended pending the outcome of the city ' s appeal.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution by carrying out a street detention and interrogation programme.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and corrective action orders, including an order to appoint a supervisor to help the police department change its practice and related training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the parties ' deliberations on the motion to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal argued that the judge should be retried because she had violated the U.S. judge's code of conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid a demonstration of bias, partly because of a series of media interviews and official statements providing a public response to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unjustifiably turning to blacks and Latin Americans under the "stop-and-search" programme.
It had appointed an external supervisor to oversee major changes, which included policy, training and monitoring reforms, and had decided to launch a pilot programme to test video cameras on television in police stations where most arrests took place.
In August, New York had decided to discontinue the practice of storing names and addresses of people whose cases had been discontinued after police checks.
The debate on the city ' s appeal is due to take place after 14 March 2014.
"Stop and search" tactics have been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
The stop-search has been practised for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor, Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, the majority of whom are black and Latin American.
In 2004, four persons, all members of national minorities, filed a class action in court.
Proponents of the "stop-and-search" programme in the New York Police Department say that these changes will put an end to bad practices, create a more reliable and effective police service and may have an impact on how other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce the morale of police officers rather than crime rates, lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult police conditions due to the reduction in the number of officers by several thousand in the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not cease the practice of "stop-and-search" which was constitutional, but changed the way the NYPD stopped people.
In the area of the Third-Kow Gallery, a pedestrian area was opened
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Third-Kow Gallery and occupies an area two kilometres from the Novokosuznetski metro station to the Bolot Square.
Street torthers, flowers, benches, urns and toilets have been installed, deaf fences and illegal advertising have been removed.
In addition to the Clementovsky and Lavrushinian alleys that had already been pedestrianed, five streets were closed to cars - the Ordina Storm, the Big and Little Tolmachew alleys, the Kadashev coast and the Bolot area.
Traffic on the streets of Marosheika and Petrovka is not restricted.
On the Friday street section from the lobby of the Novokosuznetski station to the Clementian alley, pedestrian conditions were created without the removal of traffic and the cutting of the carriageway, and are transmitted by Newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Third-Kow Gallery, the temple of the Holy Clement of the Pope, museums, libraries, monuments and other sights.
Previously, the Tver Pass, the Tables of the alley and the street of the Kuznetsk Bridge were completely pedestrian.
A large Dmitration, where the pedestrian area opened in early September, was decided to close vehicles on weekends and holidays.
Coulson hacked a phone to check a confidential message.
The former editor of News of the World's Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm false information about Charles Clarke's affair, then Minister of the Interior.
The Prosecutor, King's Counsel Andrew Edis, informed the Old Bailey Court that in May 2005, News of the World had received inaccurate news that Clark was meeting with her "attractive special counselor" Hanna Polby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulkeir to hack Paulby's voicemail and sneaking around to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left her voicemails, and the court heard.
"The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand by someone's house hoping to surprise someone, he is the man who likes to offer history to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He said that News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the other one, the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone burglary?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
Words about Clarke's novel first caught the attention of News of the World, when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
The voice mail tape received from her phone at least three times was removed from Mulkeira's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found footage on a private detective's computer in which Ms. Polby and her sister appeared as "Projects".
During the period of surveillance, Ms. Polby ' s grandparents received anonymous calls requesting information about her, Mr. Edis said.
At the time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weatherap were monitoring Ms. Polby's movements.
Leaving her a voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we're planning to publish tomorrow and which I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edis said that Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same scenario as other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blanket about an affair with a married woman while he himself was meeting with a defendant, Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks refuse to conspire with other people to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkyre, Turlbeck and Wezerap confessed to hacking phones.
Snowden is willing to speak with the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany on the wiretapping case.
A CIA officer, Edward Snowden, is willing to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so and meet with representatives of the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany, and transmits RIA News.
A letter from a former CIA officer to the FRG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by the deputy of the Bundestag, Hans-Cristian Schtrebele, through which Snowden delivered the message to the German authorities.
Schtrebel met Snowden in Moscow the previous day.
Four people were injured as a result of the fire on Tver Street
Four passers-by were injured as a result of the fire at the manifold in the centre of Moscow, on Tver Street.
According to Interfax, with reference to a source in emergency services, one of the victims is hospitalized.
According to the source, passers-by were injured during the fire in a smoked underground crossing.
According to RIA News, with reference to the head of the capital department of the fuel and energy industry, Pavel of Livinsky, electricity has now been fully restored in all houses on Tver Street.
The fire in the heat manifold near house 15 on Tver Street occurred on the evening of 31 October.
There was heavy smoke in the storm sewer hatches and smoke in the underground subway at the Armania store.
11 houses on Tver Street were disabled as a result of the fire.
At 9:45 p.m. Moscow time, the fire was removed.
The US cuts the food aid for the poor
Food allowance for four-person families is reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday, the U.S. has been reducing the financial security of food stamps, known as Foodstemps, as the relevant government program ends.
The food allowance for a family of four will now be allocated $36 less per month than in the past by officials.
It will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in fiscal year 2012, the allowance per person averaged $133 per month.
Expenditure on food aid in the United States rose to $80 billion a year because of rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14% of Americans have been relying on free food aid for "foodthamps" that has been named since before when they were paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
Republicans in Congress, however, demand further cuts in the resources allocated to the programme, saying that it should be aimed at helping those who need it most.
Food shop owners across America are worried that reductions will reduce consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to debate how government funding can be further reduced.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platformr free of charge.
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platform on PC free of charge.
WOW Insider reports it.
According to his data, the game became available on Battle.net in the classic Blizzard game section.
However, some gamers note that only those users whose accounts relate to the American part of the service can download it at present.
The game is not yet available to Russian users either.
As the media broadcast, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC is no different from the original version of the game.
The Blackthorne soundtrack also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform, which Blazzard released 19 years ago, originally appeared on SNES consoles.
His events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and bright kingdom.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlac decided to kill the good King Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was rescued from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight Sarlak's minions and protect the planet's inhabitants from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game released by the studio after its renaming as Blizzard Entertainment.
It was previously called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was published by Interplay.
There's gonna be new subway machines in Moscow.
But they're not selling tickets to passengers for money, they're selling tickets for sitting down.
One trip worth 30 rubles would cost a potential passenger in 30 seats.
The number of sittings will be counted using modern technologies, and ITAR-TASS reports with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first machine will be installed at the Exhibition Station on 8 November 2013.
The President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zhukov, and the Olympic champions of the Alexei Nemov and Elena Zaytarchikov gymnasts will host the presentation.
The National Security Agency ' s acknowledgements reinforce corporate paranoia with regard to State surveillance
On a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the United States Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
According to the Federal Constitutional Defence Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, his mission was to photograph the roof of the U.S. Mission building, which is less than 5 kilometres from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media say BfV was hoping to find antennas of listening devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the US and the German Foreign Office in Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of U.S. National Intelligence, again assured in September that the U.S. was not using foreign intelligence "to steal the commercial secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of U.S. companies to increase their international competitiveness or their profits".
But ever since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who became a exposer, began to publish his treasurer of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company leaders are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted on his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was monitoring the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gaining access to data stored by United States cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised corporate paranoia caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged for perhaps about ten years.
If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made it clear that there is intense cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I think it's quite likely that these data are being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," says Oliver Grune, president of BITMI, who represents the small and medium-sized IT companies of Germany.
German companies are convinced that the US now poses almost the same risk as China in the area of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
All the documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, however, still did not show that the US had transferred the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Policymakers expressed concern that the EU lacked certain information technology and Internet capabilities and felt that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German Parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"It's not an option," says Gasso Plattner, president of a German company that supplies software for SAP business.
If there was a need for a strong European IT industry, it shouldn't have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everyone except the IT industry.
And yet, the reach and technical development of U.S. spying agencies, known by Snowden's revelations, were a shock to some companies that used to think China was the greatest risk of surveillance.
A major shift is taking place in cloud technology, where European company leaders have become more aware that data stored in the US are under the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants have abandoned plans to use the services of a cloud provider in the United States after exposing the American program for intellectual analysis of Prism data.
Jim Sneib, one of SAP's executive directors, said, "We see consumers asking a new question that didn't come up a year ago, namely, where my data are stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically within this jurisdiction."
Many German leaders claim that the latest reports are merely proof of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at all costs.
What is happening in economic espionage is not surprising.
It's always happened.
"This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate," says Kurt Bock, CEO of the chemical company BASF.
Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial levels, and we are spying on them, too, because it is in our national interest to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually don't like to brag about the response they've taken, because it might give the enemy an advantage.
The idea of taking a free flash drive at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room has long been learned.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the board of directors of the Audi automobile company, says that for many years this standard practice has been to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German Federal Constitutional Defence Service recommends that company leaders consider the use of simple prepaid mobile phones during overseas travel due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to forced entry and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their particular niche.
"Little and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access," BfV warns.
The US alerts its own companies to economic espionage by other countries.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence Report placed France with Russia and Israel in the second series of perpetrators of economic intelligence hacking after China, claiming the Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Scarcini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency DCRI, reportedly stated in an interview this month: "The services know very well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
The parents of a teenager in Georgia who died in an "unbelievable accident" believe their son was murdered.
The parents of a Georgian teenager whose body had been found inside a deposed sports mat in his high school gym believe that their son had been killed, told the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the State of Georgia Valdosta, was found on January 11, in a vertical matt tied behind the stands in the gymnasium of his high school.
The Loundes County Sheriff's Office concluded that Johnson had died in a tragic accident, but that the family of a 17-year-old boy was disputing it.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was killed," said FoxNews.com Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
"They think it's against logic, the laws of physics, and common sense," said Kramp.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a body bag," he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll look into all the facts, wherever they come from.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds" for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told the reporters that the initial autopsy revealed that Johnson had died as a result of "positional asphyxiation".
The second autopsy, however, according to Moore, revealed another cause of death.
"There are several issues to be resolved or clarified," he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Loundes County Sheriff's Office was not available for comment when he was contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to publish all the video footage of the surveillance cameras that investigators were watching.
The teenage parents said they hoped the videos contained the key to solving how he died.
Spartacus: For information on the individuals who posted the fascist symbolism
On the official website of Spartacus, the Moscow Club announced the appearance of a fascist flag at the Jaroslavla rostrum.
"In the Shinnik Cup match, "Spartacus" on October 30, unknown provocations at the Jaroslavla stadium showed fascist symbols.
We ask all those who have reliable information about the perpetrators of this criminal offence to provide it
"Rewards are guaranteed," says the application.
Looking for fans hanging a fascist flag in Jaroslavla.
It will be recalled that in the match 1/16 of the Russian Cup, Shinnik-Spartacus was interrupted several times because of the riots at the stands.
Also in the Spartacus fan sector, fascist symbols were displayed.
As punishment, Spartacus can hold about three games without an audience.
There will be a meeting of the committee on Friday.
If you have any information about who carried and posted this symbol, please contact us.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations to schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One of the 20 children in the United States now has food allergies.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of nutritional allergy among children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The manual provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and service staff about child food allergies and how to help when an allergic reaction occurs.
It also recommends that schools keep a stock of adrenaline — most commonly using EpiPen's automatic medical syringe — to assist with potentially lethal anaphylaxis.
The state legislatures have recently amended the regulations to allow schools to supply adrenaline with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Kids can say, "it feels like something is poking into my language," "it feels like I have hair on my tongue" or "the tongue is pinching."
Parents of intersex children may choose "undefined sex"
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex in children born with intermediate external sexual organs.
Newborns will no longer have to be attributed to the male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to call any sex such children, allowing parents to indicate sex as "undefined" or "undefined" in their birth certificates.
The aim of the law was to relieve the pressure on parents who could make hasty decisions about the operation of the newborn and to counteract discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex person, according to BBC, said many years later, "I am not a man or a woman."
I'm gonna stay a doctor-made piece with bruises and scars.
About one in 2,000 children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexity, one of the approximately 60 pathological states that are diagnosed as "sexually impaired", a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonades (ovaries or seeds) or unusually developed external sexual organs.
Wallace Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identity is still underexplored, but most experts in the U.S. say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use and embezzle all available information than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Dresser, who specializes in gender identity, said that the new German law "sounds like a good idea."
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening violations that require rapid intervention, but most children do not," he said.
You can embezzle the floor without surgery and then see how the personality evolves.
The science of how a child will develop any gender identity is not very precise.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a riddle about why people are gay.
A report sent to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as distinct from transsexual or transgender people, as their condition was not gender-related but their biological structure, which was not exclusively male or female, but typical of both at the same time or not.
These characteristics can be found in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and build; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosomes and hormone structures.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice crimes.
Boys with gender disabilities now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to place male, female or "third sex" in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "sexless", claiming in court the right to retain "undefined" sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third symbol in addition to M and F - X, which is intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, a prominent Catholic country, signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is being dragged into a new state where gender is a choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning the other two pillars of civilization."
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have children set the sex at birth.
"It is difficult to raise a child without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said to the website for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genital organs were called hermaphrodites — by the name of a beautiful Greek god who had signs of both sexes.
And just a decade ago, the medical community saw gender as a leaf to erase everything and then draw it again.
But now many are challenging the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice without knowing how a child will perceive the sex assigned to it when he grows up.
"In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called an "urgent psychiatric incident", Dresser said.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genitals was proposed by Dr. John Maney of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easily changeable.
He introduced the term "gender identity" and argued that environmental signals, including social signals — the way parents raise a child — interacted with the child's genes and hormones, determining whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as "John/Joan", his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during the negligent circumcision to castrate the child completely, also removing his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it was not," said Dresser.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that right now some doctors are still "applying this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these sex-shifting operations declared themselves "disgruntled by the result".
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes of XY, but with intermediate-type genitals.
Doctors could not determine exactly whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a "full life" of a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external sexual organ and testicles were surgically removed and raised as a girl.
He was given hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was assigned vaginaplastics.
But being depressed and realizing something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
When he learned the truth, he became a man again, receiving testosterone shots and removing his breasts.
The operation made him barren.
Today, he defends others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to make the perception of people with intersexuality standard.
But Ann Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California Law Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law "instills labels and stigma".
"A lot of activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make hasty decisions and give the child an "undefined sex", she said.
We're afraid he'll facilitate intervention.
We think it's better to embezzle a male or a female and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will prove itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supported Australian law because "it allowed adults to choose a third sex".
" Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal gender," she said.
German law implies her attribution at birth.
It is a battle that young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they'll be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist mammologist from Pittsburgh, who has a sexually handicapped daughter who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law would "support" both parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Kathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual disorder called "the syndrome of total insensitiveness to androgens".
Because her androgic receptors are not working properly, Kathy has developed female signs.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Katie is married and is receiving a residency degree in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestation surrogacy.
" The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves, " said Barac.
It gives them time to do some analysis and to understand the situation, as well as a period of time before they write "male" or "female".
In that case, you're fine — raising a child, loving a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't need to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
"It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that parents have because they don't feel they're doing the right thing," she said.
Eventually, the child will decide which sex he or she is more comfortable with — and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
"Chicago" gatekeeper Nikolai Habibulin pointed out that he understands he should play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two Hawks meetings, Habibulin first missed six hits from Tampa Bay and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I failed to do so, the CSNhicago quoted Habiblein's words.
- I need to find confidence in my training, and perhaps I should approach them as games, and try to achieve a better result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that you've had.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel pretty decent in training.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into a snowball coma.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
I don't think I'm the only one who's always trying to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I don't like it.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss that much puck.
It's nice to have my one-club support, but it's pretty simple: I have to play better.
Two games aren't the whole season, but I wanted to do them much better.
But what happened happened.
I have to put this aside.
I'm just gonna try to play the next game better.
There's a bus on Altay.
In the Rubtsov district of Altai province, a PAZ bus was turned over.
As a result of the accident, 13 people were reported to have been injured and reported to the Regional Office of the MES.
The region ' s law enforcement agencies previously reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident took place around 9 a.m. local time on the No novikolyaevaka-Vishnevka road, 1 km from Nonikolaeva.
The bus from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka had 12 passengers and a driver, all injured in various degrees and were hospitalized.
Eleven of the victims were brought to Rubtsovsk City Hospital No. 1 and two were hospitalized at Rubtsovsk City Hospital.
Bears expect the SSJ-100 aircraft to arrive in Europe.
Russia expects Superjet 100 aircraft to reach Europe as soon as the markets in Latin America and Asia are established.
"We expect to receive a total of more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type," quoted "Interfax" the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitrimedev at a press conference with France's premiere, Jean-Marc Eiro.
The Head of the Russian Government noted that serious cooperation had been established with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some of the financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once the aircraft is strengthened in the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be supplied to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that he will one day be sent to France," the Russian premier stressed.
SSJ-100 is a plane built by the civil aircraft of Sukhogo in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Lyner is developed using modern technology and offers high standards of quality and comfort in a segment of 100 passenger seats.
The Dnipropetrators started a unique rescue program... the stork nest.
In the old days, in order to be brought to the court of the stork, the villagers placed a wheel from the cart on a high pillar, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special poles have long been abandoned, so the storks have loved power lines - the interlocked branches rely on wires, making the aesthetic house reliable.
Anja's grandmother, who had been living in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikov district for twenty years, began to notice how the nest settles despite the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new twigs on top, and the bottom layer's already in between the wires, and it's about to collapse.
Of course, it's a pity to have a family of storks who've been nesting at the door every year, taking out and feeding three or four chicks over the summer, but you don't want to be left out of the light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm places, Anja's grandmother called the Carican RET, which owns the support.
I didn't expect it to react so quickly.
When our experts arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding up, said Dr. Sergei Berezovsky, Technical Director of DTEK, Dneprooblangergo.
Corrosion began on wires, which were in fact already inside a nest weighing 150 - 200 kilos.
At any moment, the birds could have died from electric shocks.
And the locals risked losing light because of the damage to the wires.
So the linear monters started a nest rescue operation, not for the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from the National University of Dnipropetrovsk helped to develop a set-up for nest transfer.
They also conducted training sessions for district network staff.
Alexander Ponomarenko, a well - known ornithologist of Dempetrov, provided advice to the energy industry at all stages of the nest renovation.
To begin with, it was estimated that there were more than 50 aesthetic "rents" in an emergency area.
Special metal platforms resembling the vortex have been boiled for their reconstruction.
The base was splintered with willow branches and then moved into an old nest.
According to experts, it is sufficient to lay old branches as a basis for birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Then the storks will build their own home.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Sandshank of the Novomoskov district.
A new reinforced concrete pole was placed next to the electric pole and a platform with an old, already living nest was placed on it.
The entire operation cost 9,000 hryvnias.
And the other day, the same housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikov district on the suburb of Anja's grandmother.
This is where the platform was fixed, just lifted above the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that careful, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their apartment has undergone major repairs.
The same reconstruction is expected to take place before the end of the year in four more nests in the Pokrov and Caričan districts of Dnipropetrity.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others kill them ruthlessly.
The other day, the whole area was covered by the sad news - in the village of Ust Kamenka of the Apostolic District, on the day of the discovery of pheasant hunting, poachers shot down a swan family living on a local pond for fun.
The noble birds were not afraid of the people, but the locals fed them and did not hurt them.
When the villagers heard the gunshots, they ran to the pond, four beautiful swans were already lying dead on the water.
The Apostolic District Police Department is now investigating who shot the birds in the Red Book.
The Russian March is getting more popular.
On 4 November, the Day of People's Unity, Moscow will host the Russian March.
According to the Levada Centre survey, support for the Russ march is increasing - 40 per cent of the citizens have endorsed it to varying degrees.
According to the Levada Centre, 40 per cent of citizens approve the Russian March in varying degrees, 11 per cent of which are definitely positive and 29 per cent "early positive".
The popularity of the Russian March is gradually increasing, with only 14 per cent of Russians welcomed in 2006, and twice as many citizens (28 per cent) supported such events in December 2010.
"Surely negative" refers to "Russian Marshs" only 7% Russians, "early negative" 19% Russians.
Another 35 per cent were unable to formulate their views on this action.
This year, the City Hall of Moscow agreed on a "Russ March" of up to 15,000 people in Lublino, as reported today by the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Majoor.
This action by nationalists has been held every year on the Day of People ' s Unity since 2005.
In response to a question from social scientists, "Have you heard that Russian Marches are being held on 4 November in Russia under the slogans of defending Russian rights in Russia?" Three quarters (75 per cent) of citizens responded negatively.
Only one fifth of the Russians now know about this action (20%).
It is noteworthy that almost one third of the citizens (31 per cent) heard about the Russian Marches in December 2010.
Three years ago, on 11 December, a spontaneous nationalist rally was held in Manego Square and turned into a riot.
Levada Center also asked the Russians about the celebration of 4 November.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (People ' s Unity Day) increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15 per cent of citizens are invited to celebrate the holiday.
About as many as (17%) intend to celebrate October Revolution Day on 7 November.
The majority of citizens (62 per cent) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How did the city hall of Moscow agree on a Russ March in Lublino?
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the Russian March on 4 November in Lublino.
This was reported by the leader of the Russian association, the organizer of Dmitry Demushkin's march.
In addition to the Lublino march, a rally and a rock concert of the Kolovrat group, also agreed with the authorities, will be held on the Day of People's Unity.
How was the Russian March 2012?
On the 2012 People ' s Unity Day, nationalists held a march from the Yakimana Waterfront to the Central Artistic House, where a rally was held.
The organizers estimated the number of participants at 20,000, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs gave the figure to 6,000.
Message: Obama's election headquarters was considering Biden's exclusion for Hillary Clinton.
According to The New York Times, the closest advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral roll.
This discovery is the brightest sensation in all of Mark Galperin and John Heilemann's expected book on the 2012 campaign "Stavks Double: The Game Changed 2012".
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the president's closest assistants had conducted "large-scale studies in focus groups and opinion polls at the end of 2011" to assess whether Bayden's exclusion could help raise the declining hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to political columnist The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by senior campaign officials and the White House, the former White House Chief of Administration Bill Daley, to assess the impact of the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton as Vice-President on the vote.
A possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded at the Chicago election headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers — including Daley, former head of Obama's electoral headquarters, Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that the replacement was under consideration.
The book "The Stavks Double" claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Baiden despite their "near personal relationship", but eventually abandoned this step when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list would not "improve Obama's chances significantly".
In an interview with Martin Daley, the administration confirmed that it was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I was very much in favour of considering a lot of things, and that was one of them," said Daley to the newspaper.
You should remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, my God, what do we do?"
Although Daley described the study as "a necessary test," Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that the election staff had invested quite a lot in exploring whether that step would yield dividends in the vote.
"Pre-election headquarters don't spend that kind of money on polls and focus groups unless they take something seriously," said Martin in the AK 360 program.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had explored the possibility of replacing him.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about a possible scam.
Although Daley said he didn't think that the president "was aware" of a possible replacement, the former head of administration admitted that "maybe" Obama knew.
Martin added that "The Stavks are doubled" did not provide a clear answer to the question whether the results of the political sensing had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about exploring the possibility of removing Biden from the electoral roll.
"Perhaps," said Martin.
Do you want a glowing ice cream in the dark?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first glowing ice cream with a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came to this idea by reading a scientific article on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to recreate the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person who eats it, raising pH in the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that since ice cream starts glowing when it reacts to the heat of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company Leasney Me, I Taste, says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still at the very beginning of the production, so you'll get about 2 g of substance for £200."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, it will increase pH and the ice cream will start glowing.
We've been testing it for the past few months, and it seemed perfect to introduce it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful luminous effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever done, because the luminescence of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So every balloon costs me about £140.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef, and sauce gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop invisible ice cream."
It's by definition impossible because of the refractation caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists
Avangarda coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking of preparing his team for the regular KHL against Salavata, noted that the Omichi had conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat from the magnetic Metallurg.
The specialist stressed that Avangard should be given more attention to the defense game.
We watched a video match against the magnetic Metallurgian, which is the official "Avangard" website of Chebaturkin's words.
- Missed a lot of pucks, not a very pleasant moment.
Missed because of their mistakes, because they didn't do the game assignment.
We knew a rival had performers.
According to the statistics, they had five attacks in progress-- three pucks beat us up.
Very good implementation.
Have these mistakes been taken into account in preparing for today's game?
Me and the guys, we do every match we can, we talk after the game, we prepare for a new rival.
The main thing is that the installation is going to work.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metalurga.
The game assignment was completed, and the score was 2 to 0.
We missed the goal of "in the locker room" and we started making mistakes in the third period.
Given how difficult the game was, I didn't see any point in connecting the defenders.
It's up to the whole team to cut loose.
Right now, Avangard has a long home series, matches in a day-- the team's getting tired?
All teams are under the same conditions.
What matters now is the implementation of your moments and the performance of your game assignment.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you're running a setup, it's not that complicated.
Because of the new regulations introduced by the Russian Customs, hundreds of furs have been standing in line on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Donetsk officials have promised to provide drinking water to drivers and to install biotuals.
Hundreds of furs have gathered at the border crossing points to enter Russia.
This situation arose from changes in the rules for customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm: the Russian side is creating a turn that did not give advance warning of innovations.
Since 28 October, Russian customs authorities have introduced additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, as reported by Vladimir Denisov, Deputy Chief of East Customs.
The new model is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The points of entry are operated in a high-intensity mode.
FACTOV's reporter visited the border and contacted truckers who were held hostage.
Prices at the road cafe at the Novoazovsk pass point are rising every day, as is the line from the truck.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching about two kilometres.
The Novoazovsk-Veselo-Vozenska Customs Terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from southern Ukraine on an international motorway.
This is where the cargo is sent to the Stavropol region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Armenia.
On Sunday until midnight, and after the introduction of these rules, Alexey Golovov (in photo), a trucker who is carrying goods from Turkey to Kazakhstan through Russia and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week, is complaining.
By the new rules, to cross the border, I need an extra package of documents and freight insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the cargo and the distance to which it is taken.
Minimum insurance - 4.5 - 5,000 roubles (about 1,100 - 1,300 hryvnias).
Those who travel nearby (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo of up to $50,000 pay about 15,000 rubles (3800 hryvnias) and pass through.
And the rest of us are stuck because nobody has that big money with them!
Can you imagine if a driver carries only $4,000 worth of cargo to Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (almost 23,000 hryvnias) to pay for transit!
The conditions for survival at the border - no - are complained about by truckers who eat near their cars.
Border stores and cafes are always expensive, but we've never seen prices like this!
The salesmen were oriented and quickly whipped up: 15 hryvnias are worth a bath, seven hryvnias are a cup of coffee, and 25 hryvnias are a bowl of soup.
There's only one cafeteria.
And there's no bathroom.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the bathroom.
No bathing, no shaving...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife made it all for me.
For a week, another trucker, Victor Skotarenko, comforts himself.
Only, will my car get the line in a week?
How many liters of water do you have?
There's 11 and 15 hryvnias.
Is the bottle crystal or is the water permanent on silver?
We have a cafe, not a store.
Take it while there's something else, the saleswoman's steaming.
When the situation began to be covered in the media, the plight of Ukrainian drivers was brought to the attention of the authorities in the region.
The leadership of the Amvrosiyiv and Novoazovsky Raggodist administrations has been instructed to provide all those waiting in line on the Ukrainian-Russian border and drinking water, as stated by the Acting Chairman of the Donetsk Olygnodist Administration, Sergei Dergunov.
Ambulance teams are now on call at the grounds.
Biotuals will also be installed for human convenience.
According to the official, the list of issues will be resolved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk Obligatory Administration, as at 31 October, 32 and 68 vehicles had been parked at the Usenka and Novoazovsk international checkpoints, respectively.
The "facts" will monitor the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of trying to slander the Lithuanian president.
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking Lithuanians and Eastern Partnership countries - such a statement was made to the BNS agency in the State Security Department of the Republic.
This information is available on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to "talk" the President of Lithuania, Dal Gribaucate, and publish forged documents allegedly found in the Russian Gosarchy, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence services, the Department for the Analysis of Public Administration Processes of the Russian President ' s Administration on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is preparing an information attack.
The entity is headed by Evgeny Umerkov, who has visited Lithuania on numerous occasions and participated in the Convention of the Lithuanian People's Party.
A member of the department of V. Smirnov is also alleged to be involved in the operation.
According to the intelligence service, Smirnov, undercover, regularly visited Lithuania until the end of 2012 and contacted local politicians, political scientists and the media.
Smirnov is now prohibited from entering the country.
The previous day, the President of Lithuania, Gribaucate, had announced that she was aware of the information being prepared for her.
In her view, the main reason was Lithuania's successful presidency of the Council of the European Union and its "aim for energy independence"
The Lithuanian leader has previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities on more than one occasion.
Thus, she stated that in the Kremlin Lithuania was "underrespected".
Moreover, Gribaucatei accused Vladimir Putin, the head of the Russian Federation, of bringing "only demands" to Lithuania.
It will be recalled that in September Rossimnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian milk into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the products did not meet the sanitary and epidemiological standards.
The leader of Lithuania then stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the Government should prepare an appeal to WTO.
In the United States, the principal of the school opened fire on teenagers.
The principals of an American high school literally made teenagers desperate.
The man said he had to take the gun and start shooting.
The incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, juvenile bullies threw toilet paper at a man's house.
As a result, the school principal opened fire on teenagers, resulting in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not in the Director ' s property, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released from prison on bail of $125,000.
Note that shooting civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in the center of Ridgecrest in the U.S. state of California on the street.
The perpetrator then took two random passers-by hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Previously, there was a shooting in Newtown Elementary School, Connecticut.
Adam's mom worked at school, and she was a teacher.
Shots fired at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident took place on 31 January at an American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, not to go to bed late and make a masquerade for our neighborhood.
Now I'm more like a scrub.
I haven't shown up in the last two years handing out candy in my apartment, and I probably won't be here this year.
However, statistics show that I'm a white crow in relation to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans — 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and jewelry.
The only thing I expect every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation projects a costume of $1.2 billion out of $6.9 billion spent.
This year, at the peak of fashion, sexual inanimate objects.
Women no longer have to be sex workers; they can also be sex food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for the men, I think we're gonna see a lot of zombies through the Walking Dead, and I'm sure the Daft Punk astronauts are gonna get into our Instagram ribbons this year.
According to Google, the costumes most commonly sought are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
There's probably nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed up our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
It means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't change.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, candy candy, Milk Duds, chewing candy Twizzlers, and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million children who need candy who are prepared to conquer our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and — and we will not deceive ourselves — eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Association of Candiers, almost 35 million pounds of it is sold as Halloween.
It's about 9 billion individual cornseeds.
It's a mystery that I have yet to solve.
Nothing expresses Halloween as much as a haunted house.
They have amazing names, such as "The Horror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Voice and Scream" and "House of Shock".
Moreover, according to American Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America that generate about $500 million in income, as well as those amazing photos where you almost described yourself, which your friend posted on Facebook, and you can't remove, and then the guy you like sees this picture and leaves a comment like "a cool look on your face."
And in conclusion, we'll talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting off Jack's lamp is like a Christmas tree ornament, what we've been doing since we were kids.
Luckily for us, it wasn't until last year that the Pinterest started fashioning the baby in the pumpkin, so most of us grew up cutting out these pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack's light, slowly drying up on your porch, is likely to come from Illinois, who raised 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want to do more than that, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try cutting something out of their 2032-weight pumpkin.
The Estonian Ministry of Defence site was restored after an attack by Ukrainian hackers
The website of the Estonian Ministry of Defence has been restored after the morning cyber attack, as reported by the agency's press service.
According to the Vice Chancellor of the Department of Defense for Information and Administration, Tymar Petercop, it was a primitive attack, and the site was just overloaded with a lot of requests.
Our specialists have quickly established everything, and so far the site has been restored.
"The damage to the Ministry is minimal," said Petercop to Postimees.
According to Petercop, it's too early to talk about who organized the attack.
"We will certainly analyse the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions from it, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents completely," he admitted.
On November 1, Anonymous Ukraine posted an online address confirming the hacker attack on the Estonian Ministry of Defence website and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We shouldn't be NATO servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be a slave to anyone.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
"Hands away from Ukraine," says Anonymous.
The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine previously reported that a company of the Marines of the Feodosian separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marines would take part in command and staff exercises of NATO Response Forces Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Owing to the fighting of unclean force, several schools and the hospital had to be shut down.
Four schools in Zimbabwe's province of South Matabelland had to close because the students were attacked by... Goblins.
According to the local elder, the children were panicked and it was not possible to continue their studies.
The story of goblins may sound like a child's invention for a European, but in Africa it is a very serious argument for closing a school.
Adults too are afraid of unclean power.
In the summer, for example, a hospital closed in Zimbabwe because the medical staff were also attacked by goblins.
It was announced that the Land Rover series would be released.
Inside are racing seats and six-point safety belts, as well as an internal communication system.
Advanced brakes, a service package that provides access to Bauler Works mechanics, logistical support, and storage of the car between events are also available.
Drew Bauler, managing director of Bauler Motorsport, said, "Bowler band members have changed.
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people looking for excitement, adventures, and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to propose such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try the different disciplines of the rally in Britain and abroad, as well as to prepare the participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the Rally Ride.
We had great pleasure in developing the Defender Challenge car, which would be a really exciting championship.
In addition, Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as an opportunity to participate in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian silovists don't know anything about the Brats Circle-New News.
It is written by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the Russian law enforcement agencies.
"After reports in the media that the U.S. Treasury Department had placed Leps on the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate 'Brat Circle', we looked at all the databases, but no such group was found," said the agency's interviewer.
In his view, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As previously written by "NI", yesterday the U.S. Treasury published on its website a list of alleged members of the Brad Circle gang.
Among them was a Russian singer, Grigory Leps.
He's on the list as Grisha, posted the previous day.
They match the data of a popular Russian performer.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevridze, a creative alias, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, a Uzbek citizen and another from the former USSR whose citizenship is not specified.
The U.S. is convinced that Gregory Leps, who lives on Phuket Island, was transporting money for bandits on their orders.
A photograph of the singer is attached to the present report and all his data, which are valid, are included.
Moreover, Leps did buy a house on Phuket recently.
The agency indicated that it intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
The blacklisting of a person by the U.S. Ministry of the Interior has resulted in the freezing of his assets in the U.S. and a ban on business contacts with people living in the United States.
Leps's assistant, Maya Serikov, stated that no notice was given to the singer: "It's hard to answer the question whether it's the Grigory that everyone's talking about in the U.S. scandal."
All Leps knows is the media.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I don't know if they happen in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all funny on the one hand, and on the other it's amazing and unexpected," she said RIA News.
According to her, Grigory Leps doesn't live on Phuket, but according to the U.S. Department, he does have a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him on a flight to the city of Bognordensk.
Runner in the field in the Shinnick match.
Some details of the fan who ran out to the field during the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup between Jaroslav's Shinnick and Moscow's Spartacus have become known.
As stated by the head of the Russian Federation CDC, Arthur Grigorianz, referring to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the fan is a Moscowian.
He's in custody at the moment.
"In addition to this, Grigorianz described how a fan managed to break through the field: "It turns out that this one, we call him an spectator, went to an ambulance accompanied by two viewers, citing heart problems.
He went to the E.R. - the E.R. confirmed it to us.
And then he pushed away two escorts and ran to the field.
He fled from the corner of the Eastern and Southern rostrum to the corner of the Eastern and North rostrum.
He ran across the field.
It's the flight attendant's responsibility.
Pending the entry into force of the Sports Act, this is an area of flight attendant activity - the police cannot interfere with what is on the field.
He ran to the rostrum, climbed over the Eastern rostrum.
And at that time the riots began on the Eastern rostrum and on the treadmills," the head of the KDC said.
Let us recall that by the decision of the KDC, Moscow's Spartacus will hold the upcoming matches of Russia's 15th tournament against Locomotiva and Zenita, and will also pay a fine of 600,000 rubles.
Fire brigades were called to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 50 feet above the ground in a dangerous quarry.
Coker-spaniel Ruby ran away after she had a little accident.
Three days later, a man walking a dog noticed her trapped in her career.
Firefighters came down on a rope on a backside to save the dog from imminent death.
The puppy was lucky to be saved after the fire brigades were called up to pick him up and get him to a safe place, after he somehow got stuck at a height of 50 feet on the dangerous slope of the back slope.
Ruby's nine-month-old coker-spaniel ran away after a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before she was rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her masters, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at Flappet's quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire fire and rescue service.
They scrambled for their missing dog and posted messages on social media websites after she ran off into a quarry after a small accident.
At about 14:15 on Wednesday, a dog driver saw Ruby stuck at a height of 50 feet on a quarry.
The technical rescue team from the Clekhiton fire station rushed to the scene, went down on ropes to save Ruby, and used the transport to lift her up the slope.
The rescue officer, Andy Clayton, said, "She was in a dangerous situation."
It was right in the middle of the slope, 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move the muscle during the rescue, she's completely frozen.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
The rescue officer Peter Lau said, "Rubi is very lucky to have been rescued."
There was a possibility that she might have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for an examination, and it was determined that she was okay, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, Western Yorkshire, said: "The watch for salvation was scary."
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when we had her back in our hands.
The vet said that if she was exhausted and unconscious, she'd probably fall.
The fire department was great.
It was very brave — what they did.
We're so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson from Kitley added: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fire department was amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he wasn't flirting with Katie Perry when she was 18.
During an interview at an Australian radio show this week, a pop star stated that she was a back-up vocalist for Jagger's 2004 Old Habits die hard song.
Perry said she was having dinner with a rocker veteran, and she said, "He was flirting with me when I was 18."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of 70-year-old Jagger said that he "critically denies that he ever hit Katie Perry".
The representative added: "Maybe she's confusing him with someone else."
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Breaking up with Europe gives Scottishs a choice
One more day, another scarecrow for independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition for EU membership.
There is a turn of stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along the Adrian Wall.
True, Strathclyde pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movements across the rest of Europe, although — predictablely — this did not appear in the headlines.
Nor has anyone pointed out that EU member countries spend a lot of time turning their formal rules as conveniently as they are.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen zone, continuing non-compliance will be a cheap concession for Brussels, instead of what he really wanted from the Scottishs.
So it's an unattractive story.
And it's so old that it's become fossils: for the first time, I heard the "truth" that "independence means passport control", at least 40 years ago.
Still, there's an interesting moment lost in re-saiding an old story.
Why does an independent Scotland have to follow Europe's orders?
Why change London's yoke to Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With Eurocrisis, the Europa project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or to the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining momentum.
Even in Germany, the party of Euroskeptics, "Alternative for Germany", founded only this year, emerged from nowhere and obtained almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus effectively replacing the "Free Democrats" (similar to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency have led many people to believe that the "Europe" project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments working against excessive budget deficits — it was only true for Greece.
In fact, the euro system has blocked its members on exchange rates beneficial to German exporters — which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe finds itself in a pre-distributive position in terms of production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only lifesaving measure is to cut salaries and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current fiscal and currency problems is the deeper problem of Europe ' s productive capacity.
As a result of the green energy package introduced by Brussels — the cipher that subsidizes French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer — the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the US.
It's a paralysingly unfavourable price environment, as we've seen in Grangemouth.
No wage freeze in the world will stop the devastating victory of US cheap shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, there is a mutiny, especially in France, once the most violent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the destroyed French economy in distress.
The result is the right-wing anti-EU party, Marin Le Pen's National Front, which has just won decisive by-elections, leaving the ruling Socialist party in third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 per cent of the vote — a timely warning to British Laborists that it cannot be assumed that division among the right will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newfound popularity in the French white working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If – and this is very likely – anti-EU parties are supported in these elections, such a bloc will be able to dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
Here's my opinion: Soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the common currency in Europe will come together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something of a vague "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies can maintain the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I assume that Britain will distance itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain is likely to be neglected in the cold of the Atlantic.
What position does that leave Scotland in?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect Scotland will succeed in a more free European arrangement, provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway ' s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party Government in Scotland is, strangely speaking, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which won an impressive majority of votes in 2011, thanks to objections to the cost reductions proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Treasury, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent coalition of Tory and Liberal Democrats.
Scotland would now be ridiculous to vote for independence only to adopt austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Sexual Maturity: Ageing Before
African-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty before their white peers do research.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that obesity can be one of the triggers for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etherage is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be frightened if her daughter begins to develop breast and pubic hair at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Paediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and constitute a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming my parents — usually that does not mean a rapid onset of full puberty," said Caplovitz.
Visible signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, and the smell of the body, appear earlier in girls' lives.
But there was only a small shift at the age of menarche (first menstruation) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
"After breast development, it takes at least two to three years to menarche," said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of the book Early Sexual Maturity in Girls: How to deal with this widespread problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but is considered to be "early", when breast growth is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to eight years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or slow down — that the pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progress can be used as a basis for endocrinology tests to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures in place to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of bones, which can eventually lead to slow growth and low growth in adulthood.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, level of development, rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is careful with her medication, but acknowledges that "sexual maturation can alleviate behavioural problems and the feeling of girls that they are different from their peers".
Another big problem is that parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or even how they handle hygiene issues," said Caplovitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many popular theories about the causes of early puberty.
Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are responsible for milk or other foodstuffs, environmental chemicals or sexual messages in the media.
Boys, like girls, have early puberty.
Caplovitz claims that the condition that has the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, it helped to conduct a study of girls aged 6 to 9, which links the amount of fat in the body to puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In that country, African-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There are various explanations.
Early puberty is likely to be influenced worldwide by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
The mystery is that although boys have hair on their faces and pubics at a younger age, the trend towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of pubic and pubic hair can occur even in infants and children of child-bearing age.
"We must be careful how we determine the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at the Gorieb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be embarrassed to receive instructions from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This could mean an earlier than expected conversation," he explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who thrive early on need confirmation that even when they are ahead of schedule, this process is a normal part of life.
The American Boeing trapped in Chita is preparing for flight.
In the framework of the Open Skies Treaty, observation flights over Russian territory and an unscheduled United States aircraft landing at Chita on Wednesday, Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 p.m. Moscow time, will leave the city ' s air harbour.
The airport authorities allowed the flight to take off with money for fuel.
According to the airport, the plane will leave for Ulan Uday.
According to other reports, he's going to the U.S.
A plane flying to Ulaanbaatar was reported to have landed in the Zabaikal region because of fog.
Owing to unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita airport.
The aircraft has 30 passengers, including a crew, who spent two nights at the airport, reporting to ITAR-TASS.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, under the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, persons on board aircraft are not allowed to leave Chita airport, but only at two Russian airports, in Cuba and in Ulaanbaatar.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992 and 34 States are parties to it.
Observation flights take place over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, facilitate the monitoring of arms control agreements, enhance crisis prevention and crisis management capacities within the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the dead celebrity make-- the MK in the U.S.
The ranking of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was led by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But her late Michael Jackson, whose postmortem income was 160 million between October 2012 and October 2013, "slapped" by her.
He is far behind by other retired celebrities who earned a few times less money last year.
The second to be listed by Forbes after the year was 55 million in a year, and the author of the Peanuts comic books, Charles Schultz, with 37 million, was the author of the "Peanuts" comic book.
They included Elizabeth Taylor, former leader (25 million) and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein were also on the list.
In Moscow, the first boutique of Igor Guliayev opened.
On 23 October, the first flagship boutique of Igor Guliayev was opened in Moscow.
The designer Igor Guliaev is known to the general public for his excellent luxury furs.
And now they'll be able to appreciate even more fashion fans -- in Moscow, his first boutique finally opened, about which the designer threw a dolce vita party.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
That's why I'm particularly glad I opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there really is a part of me.
That's what Igor used to cut the red ribbon and invite anyone who wanted to... try on the models he liked!
The jet manufacturers are hostile about the width of the seat when there are large orders at stake.
A fierce dispute over the width of the tourist-class seats on long-distance flights broke out among the leading aircraft manufacturers, setting the tone for violent confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-distance flights to economy-class passengers whose interests are not always at the centre of airline concerns, while the space allocated to them plays a key role in allegations of the effectiveness of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would have a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy-class salons, but its main American competition, Boeing, says it should be decided by airlines.
The dispute is taking place at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in sales of larger versions of their two-engine long-distance aircraft, and the event on 17-21 November is expected to produce potentially record orders.
The assembly of the back of the plane — especially whether 9 or 10 people are sitting in a row — is central to the statements of cost-effectiveness of the new mini-airbus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on seats in the economic class of more than 17 inches wide, 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in economy class in seats 18 inches wide, 9 in rows.
Aeroplane giants often exchange technical blows through advertising in the professional press.
Airbus now addresses the public directly in front of the Dubai air show, where 777X is expected to lead with more than 100 orders.
She has recently demonstrated how a new advertising war could begin by showing financialists a slide that depicts three people in a restaurant held together, called "Would you agree to this?"
"Boeing offers long-distance flights in seats that are narrower than those of regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus sales manager John Lihee.
With the change in diet, people gain weight, but the plane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-fuse Boeing 747 set standards for modern long-distance travel, and the border of the century, the weight of the average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist of the 21st-century average American male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. Health Service statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitors adhere to the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average waist grip of those recently called "reactive public" was already there.
Airbus says she commissioned a study showing that an extra inch in the seat width improves sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus numbers for seat size and says that manufacturers should not interfere with decisions about how airlines balance tariffs with convenience.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the passenger compartment does not depend solely on the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving airlines a choice and an opportunity to do what they think they should do to succeed," said Cent Craver's Boeing expert.
They don't want us to decide what's gonna make them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase side-by-side space, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
This dispute is followed by a race for aircraft orders, valued at at at least $700 billion at catalyzing prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of American to European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the location of seats is exactly what fuels competition between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing report a 20 per cent increase in profitability by one in their last two-engine long-distance models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared Boeing characteristics are based in part on a comparison of the 10-seat series of 777X with the original 9-seat configuration of the 777 design series.
The unit cost gain is reduced when compared to the 10-seat arrangement currently in use.
"The reason Boeing does this is to squeeze more seats and make his plane more competitive than our designs," said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that parlors with a full 10-seat row for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense seating area that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
"The 18-inch seat would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that the Airbus proposal is commercially driven by a threat from the 777th model," said the interior specialist Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply chairs, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Flight dealers around the world even carry roulettes to check competing plans.
Commending comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very tight salon structure for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 rows, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the need for additional modifications to the salons by offering larger access points to some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say that her call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could divert attention from the sales wave of model 777X.
A new antinicotin vaccine can rob the process of smoking pleasure.
Scientists have developed an antinicotin vaccine that could deprive cigarette smoking of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from life-long nitric dependence.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Welle Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were encouraging.
"We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit by testing all the methods available in the market today, but have found that their nitric dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern methods," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of antinicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady flow of antibodies.
Antibodies hunt down any molecules of nitrin in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nitrite blow.
Vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nitrite, continued their normal activities.
And the mice that weren't given the vaccine were "relaxed," and that's a sign that didn't reach their brains," researchers say.
These experiments are described in Science Transnational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it turns liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to the children before they had the desire to try a cigarette, preventing nitric addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nitric vaccine, and that could help them get rid of the habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Olenikov: one third of the rural settlements of Pomoskovya, fully subsidized
The Vice-Governor of Podioskovya Yuri Olenikov stated that almost one third of the rural settlements in Moscow province were fully subsidized
A total of 187 settlements out of 288 receive grants from the region ' s budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 receive grants from the regional budget.
The share of grants to the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent of grants.
As part of the budget security, about 25 billion roubles are allocated from the regional budget," said Olenikov.
The Vice-Governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mochish, Odtsevo and Pushkino - had a budget of more than 1 billion roubles for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million roubles, "this is not enough".
The cost of maintaining the local administration in 88 settlements of Podmoskovya is over 70 per cent, "with a decline in the quality of services", noted Olenikov.
He had previously instructed the heads of municipalities of Pomoskovya to think before the end of November about which settlements needed to be enlarged, merged into urban districts or changed administrative management.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Previously, the Governor of Moscow province had stated that, as part of the administrative reform in Pomoskovje, it was planned to reduce the number of rural grant settlements.
There is also a request for municipal consolidation in Mojaj, Kashir, Sunnynogor, Colomen, Lubjertz and Kotelnik.
Discussions on this issue in the cities and regions of the region will begin in November.
President Mobolduma Igor Brnzalov also stated that all in the coming Adm Reforms were planning about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of Podmoskovya.
This is due to the fact that of 178 rural settlements in Pomoskov, less than one third have a "acceptable" financial base and 100 have a grant base.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children.
Diana Arbenina doesn't hide the great pleasure she gets from raising her children.
Despite the fact that Arbenina is now particularly time-consuming in her creative and social activities, she still finds the opportunity to work with Martha and Artem, not only to spend time learning them, but also to entertain them as much as she can.
Over the past week, Diana has twice reported to her fans on her teaching talents.
First, she posted on Facebook a picture of her teaching her children to read.
And last night, she was pampering fans, showing me how Artema and Martha dressed up for Halloween.
The broom races are ready! Our first Halloween" called Diana the photograph of her children dressed in holiday suits.
Which is inadvisable, because they, like any other Russian boys and girls, have something to do with this party, since they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce "undefined gender" in the registration of children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to indicate "undefined" instead of males or females when registering children born of hermaphrodites.
The child's parents will have the right to leave the "sex" count on the birth certificate blank for a time.
For "F" (female) or "M" (male) parents may write "X" (undefined) temporarily.
The purpose of this decision is not to encourage parents to rush into a gender-specific operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermaphroditis.
Tripody denies being influenced by Obeid.
Joe Tripody, former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, will be part of an investigation into the State's anti-corruption oversight body.
Former Minister Joe Tripody of New South Wales denies changes in the lease of offshore facilities at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obaid, who secretly owned three properties on public land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obaid had lobbyed several state ministers to extend the lease contracts at Serquilar Ki, where two restaurants and cafes were owned by the Obaid family, without a tender after their expiry in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obaid ' s clandestine participation in real estate after testimony given by Mr. Tripody Lynn Ashpoul, former Deputy Chief of Administration, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease be presented for public competition.
Tenants were opposed to this and also wanted longer lease terms.
In 2009, the business leases at Serquilar Ki, which brought about $2.5 million a year to the Obaid family, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 until November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obaid, who, as Mr. Tripody acknowledged, had urged changes in the Government ' s rental policy.
The telephone decrypting provided by ICAC included conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripody and Steve Dunne, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obaid ' s leadership in the Fisheries Division.
"Has the issue discussed during these telephone conversations been the development of commercial rental policies?" Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheley, Mr. Tripody, asked.
"No," said Mr. Tripody.
I can't remember what was discussed, but definitely it wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to a high-ranking official, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria.
A senior administrative official in an interview with Fox News confirmed that Israeli warplanes had attacked a target in the Syrian port town of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official didn't specify what the target was, but he said at least one.
Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel fired air strikes at missiles inside Syria.
Foreign visa workers of Division 457 can be tested for "authenticity"
A "authentic" test for foreign visa workers of class 457 is under consideration by the Government, as it envisages an expansion of repressive measures.
The test, if adopted, will be applied to criteria aimed at preventing the use of class 457 visas to fill unskilled posts or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The Government ' s discussion paper was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McKew criticized the Government ' s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying that it might offend Australia ' s neighbours.
"Loud statements, such as "foreigners at the end of the line" and "Australian work first" represent a very unpleasant setback to the times when trade unions demanded a secure labour market," she said to the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white work that needed to be protected — and if some in the region saw the backs of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The paper presented for discussion outlined 12 measures previously considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets with officials about human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes and the rest are under consideration.
If the "authentic" criteria are accepted, the applicant for a visa may be examined to determine whether "the candidate is genuine in circumstances where the applicant is a relative or close friend of the owner or a person involved in the financing of the enterprise".
Enterprises may also be required to account for the number of class 457 visa holders, since in the past, businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of workers then hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seekers died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
This man's nine-year-old son, who was killed in grief, accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father's death on Wednesday he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board the ship.
The Australian authorities rushed a man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
Semen Varlamova's friend stated that the hockey player suffered from alcoholism.
Semen Varlamov Eugenia Vavrinück, a friend of the hockey player, stated that he was an alcoholic and was handed over by the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said, inter alia, a woman.
It will be recalled that Vavrinyuc filed a lawsuit for beating a Golkyper against Russia's team, Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockey player dragged her by the hair and beat her up - after the attack, her hands, chest, stomach, and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself went to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing the incident in detail.
He was arrested, but later released on bail for $5,000.
The court did not restrict an athlete to travel across the country, but it did not allow him to approach Vavrinyuk.
He also faces imprisonment for up to six years for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact on Scotland of the HS2 railway project.
HS2 is a high-speed project with Scotland and Northern England, starting Phase I in 2026.
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, noted that the project "will unite Britain".
Minister of Transport of Scotland Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work on the plan with the British government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When Phase Two is completed, the lines will be set up in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of constructing a high-speed line between London and Northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in rail capacity and shorter travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include an opportunity to cross from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our target for HS2 is to create a truly national network that will bring Britain and its cities closer together."
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about urban transport links with each other; throughout the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better served by HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called upon Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall argument for a high-speed railway across the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, the creation of benefits for all and the continuation of the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British Ministers next year and to taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Is Tory the new hope of nuclear power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to provide for energy needs.
The combustion of hydrocarbons (where they exist) has a negative effect on the climate.
Renewable sources of energy require large areas for generation.
Nuclear power costs without both, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste disposal.
Recently, scientists have drawn attention to thorium, another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and experts claim that its splintering does not leave waste that must be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures taken in the United States to relax the regulations relating to these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers could read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided that they remained in the Flight Mode.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but it is annoying to many that they do not have access to their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required United States airlines to do a great deal of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they were not planning to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they were considering the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
"The Civil Aviation Safety Authority does not currently have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," she said.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at any time and for passengers to comply with the safety rules reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, who had already discussed with the Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on board, was not opposed to the changes, but stated that it would follow the direction of the regulator.
"We would welcome consideration by the Civil Aviation Aviation Safety Authority of the issue of allowing the use of electronic devices, because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it (a live wireless entertainment system) is on our planes," said the spokesperson.
Qantas announced that she would follow the rules currently in force.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not plan to change them soon," she said.
The FAU regulation applies to United States airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully examine the decision of the FAU and the reasons for it.
For US carriers, the impact of the order will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference with mobile devices, as well as revise manuals, training materials, hand luggage standards and passenger instructions.
"After the airline has verified and confirmed the immunity of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones at any altitude," FAA stated.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during boarding.
In addition, according to the group ' s recommendation, the heavier devices shall be located under the seats or in the upper baggage compartments during take-off and landing.
Dagestan's head hears notes of extremism in Kubani's anthem
The football match between Angi and Kubanyu resulted in a political conflict between the authorities of Krasnodar province and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagesan flag, and the Kubani anthem sounded different.
On Thursday, the head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov invited Republican parliamentarians to appear before the courts because the anthem of Krasnodar province allegedly calls for inter-ethnic discord, in particular calling for war against the "Basurmans".
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar region, which was adopted in 1995 today.
It's a shame, and no one's doing it.
"Remembering you here as the mother of your mother, the enemy, the bassurmanin, we are going to the death battle," expressed solidarity with the President of Parliament, Hizri Shihsaid, for which such words would be recorded in the anthem, to poison some believers against others."
Putin achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now, news from the ocean, namely Syria, where, as we know today, Israel has attacked Russian-made missiles that are reported to have been destined for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled the important condition of destroying its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement brokered by Russia that allowed the United States not to carry out a military operation to which it came close this summer.
More about weapons and what all this means to the Syrian President, our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel, will tell us.
Washington stated that Assad's regime would be punished for that.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August of poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal that Assad's friend Vladimir Putin made.
Syria will abandon its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had disabled declared chemical weapons factories.
The longer-term and difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad's days were numbered.
I think Assad should leave.
The question isn't whether it's gonna happen, it's when it's gonna happen.
He's no longer a legitim and has to leave.
But Assad stays.
And it feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people were forced to leave their homes, and many were starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad has escaped punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement has been described as a success in diplomacy, the inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has given the impression of a cooperative person.
Today, in Washington, the US Ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of starvation, it is hardly easier for his mother to avoid being killed with chemical weapons.
Assad's holding on for a while.
And changing weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation has established a separate Ministry of Construction and CKH
Russian President Vladimir Putin set up a new Ministry responsible for construction and LKH and invited him to lead the former Governor of the Ivanov region, Mikhail Mena, in a private meeting.
The President met Michael Mena at the residence in Novo Ogarevo, and Men did not refuse to lead the new agency.
Russian President Dmitri Peskov's spokesperson explained that all construction and LKH functions were being transferred to a new ministry from the Minre region.
Michael Mene, son of a famous Orthodox priest, Protoyere Alexander Me, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemistry called Gobkin.
Since 1995, his political career began - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergijevo-Posad region, a deputy of the State Duma, the first Vice-Premier of the Moscow Region Government, and the Vice-Premier of the Moscow Government.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Michael Men was governor of the province of Ivanov.
The pawnshop owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties.
In a pawnshop at the Bendemir mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthaling puts in a gold bracelet, ring, and earrings to pay for his daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is in there," says Ms. Amirthaling.
Although she earns $3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia — where household debt is growing — is such that ValueMax, where it makes its deal, became the third pawnshop on Singapore's stock exchange this week.
Jewelry loan is not just a quick way to get money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthaling), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
The pawnshops in Singapore usually charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered at the United Overseas Bank office, a local lender with a subsidiary at the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require credit testing or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks.
Millions of people throughout the region therefore resort to pawnshops, as families feel pressured by rising costs of living and rapidly increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth in the wake of the global financial crisis and cheap loans fuelled by free monetary policies in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to pawnshops to compensate for the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, identified an increase in the family's credit shoulder, mainly due to the growth of the mortgage, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list from 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing decline in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"The truth is, with rising prices, people in the middle and bottom [income tables] will be looking for ways to supplement their incomes where they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIB, a Malaysian bank.
The record high gold prices in the past two years have increased the rush with which people lay their personal belongings because they take advantage of the opportunity to earn money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70% of the stuff planted in 200 pawnshops in the city-state is gold.
People say, "Golden looks good, let's put Grandma's gold chain on and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, an operator of the Bendemir branch and 15 others similar in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where he has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Li Ching, executive director of ValueMax.
The company will fund the expansion using 60 percent of the S-66 million raised this week as a result of the stock market in Singapore.
While some creditors had given rise to criticism because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeah said that the pawnshop not only offered cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also did not increase the debt directly.
"Custodians lay down items they already own, and monetizing personal assets does not increase household debt," she says.
The mortgage is gaining increasing public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured financing.
And pawnshops are not only used by those people who are in financial distress.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax offices to plant gold bars or Rolex watches that can give up to 60% of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties," Ms. Yeah said.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number and status of existing health facilities that matter to the population that matters, but the quality of health care provided.
The implementation of the programme "Modernizing Health Care in Tulsk Region 2011 - 2013" and the reorganization of our city's health facilities will make it possible to establish an optimal structure for the provision of health care to the population, including gynaecological patients, pregnant women and mothers.
For example, after joining up with the hospital, it has become even more possible to recruit specialized specialists from the NGCS to consult pregnant women with various pathologies and to conduct additional tests at the hospital.
During the modernization programme, the material and technical base of the maternity home has been significantly improved and modern equipment in line with world standards has emerged.
During these years, approximately 8 million roubles have been allocated for major maintenance of the premises and 112 items of equipment worth 42 million roubles have been purchased.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
The O.R. uses the Sell-Saver machine to collect blood from the operating wound and, after special treatment, to return it to the mother, avoiding the transmission of foreign blood.
The Clinical and Laboratory Diagnostics Unit is also equipped with modern equipment.
The women ' s clinic has an electronic register, and there are plans to introduce electronic maps and patient history in the near future.
The development of telemedicine has made it possible to consult gynaecological patients, pregnant women, mothers and newborns with regional specialists.
The Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
The people of Chechnya were arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been under way since March this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasus.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes at a hotel in Strasbourg and then beat and robbed them.
The gang leader was a 27-year-old male from Chechnya.
In 2013, David Alabá became Austria's best athlete, reporting on the official Bundesliga website.
In this dispute, he beat the winter sportsmen, who have traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by the skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third by the ski jumper from Gregor Schleerencauer.
Last season, a 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigeriaan origin helped his team win the Championship League, the Championship and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Bowl.
Arshavin's ex-wife is resting with actor Andrei Chadov.
Andrei Arshavin Julia Baranovsky, the former civil wife of Peter's "Zenit" footballer, spends his vacation with actor Andrei Chadov.
Julia is resting in Italy with actress Anastasia Zarogova, her fiancé, figurer Sergei Slavnov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
Photos of couples walking together have been published in Instagram Anastasia of the Road.
This isn't the first picture of Andrei and Julia together.
On 5 October, the Zarogina published a picture of a couple standing on the coast of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Hawbek "Zenita" Andrei Arshavin admitted to living separately from his civilian wife, Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranovsky and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, having three children.
It has recently become known that Arshavin is dating Alice Kazmina's ex-model.
Arshavin's new friend was married to the top manager of the corporation.
Saved package of $325 million for Tasmania health care
The Federal Government insists that the $325 million rescue package for the weakened Tasmania health system will be complemented by stringent conditions that guarantee that the state government will not waste money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth was taking "urgent measures" to prevent a crisis caused by the ageing population of this island state, higher levels of chronic disease and system constraints.
The decision on funding for four years was taken after consultations between the Government and the independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilki.
"The Government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," Ms. Plibersek said today.
A $325 million package includes $31 million for the planned operations blitz campaign.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help to overcome the backlog.
There is also money for unrecorded clinics in Hobart and Lonston to improve the quality of post-hospital care, train medical professionals, mental health services and introduce personal electronic health card systems in local hospitals.
"This investment will be based on the ideas put forward by the best doctors on how best to help the Tasmania health system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmania Government would work under strict accountability and responsibility.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report monthly on where it spends these additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the staff provides services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would not solve anything "if they were not followed by genuine reform that would put Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable basis".
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for its response to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to bringing this state's health system out of its critical state," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the State Government, these additional sampling procedures largely compensate for recent reductions.
But the federal opposition representative for health, Peter Dutton, believes that today's statement is "a solution similar to that of a white-collar.
"The reason we're here is because the state Labour government threw up $430 million from the health care system," he said to ABC TV.
When the state government pulls almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, you can't pretend it's good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Pliberseck to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The screening of Guillaume Nicklu's novel, Denis Didro, may boast exceptional production and historical details, but it is also more difficult to understand than it should have been.
The film, launched in France in the 1760s, tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to the monastery by his family.
When she starts to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadist superintendent and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to vulgarness or sensation, and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the story risks being a test like a moose and for the audience.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing equipment, says the monitoring group.
Syria destroyed the basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas ammunition, and the international monitoring group stated on Thursday, while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the outbreak of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The chemical weapons ban declaration was issued one day before
The deadline of 1 November established by this Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or "unworkable" all chemical weapons production facilities and mechanisms to mix chemicals with the production of toxic gas and to fill them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
This statement was made during a fierce fighting on Thursday in the town of Safira, where experts believe a chemical weapons production facility, as well as a storage site, is reported by the British-based Syrian Centre for Human Rights Protection.
A group of activists who tracked casualties through a network of activists in Syria stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government ' s side, the group stated that 29,954 persons were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-Government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among those killed, as stated in the statement, were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to the 25 July UN estimate, 100,000 have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad ' s troops fought the rebels in Safir for several weeks, many of whom are associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there had been casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The fights highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who are fuelled by the short time frame of their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team "is now satisfied that it has verified and seen destroyed all critical Syrian items of production and mixing/fueling equipment".
She added that "no additional inspection activities are currently planned".
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that both sites were, according to Syria, "deposited and ... chemical weapons programme items in them were moved to other declared sites that were verified".
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the site in Safir was one of the two locations that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director-General of the Monitoring Group, Ahmet Üzümcü, in a commentary published by OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has confronted the rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad Government and its security forces, which are composed of members of its Alavite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
With regard to other events, the head of the Rami Abdurrahman centre said that there had been a major explosion on the Wednesday at an air defence site in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger from the conviction of the organizers of the Bali terrorist attack
The survivors and relatives of 202 victims of the bomb attack in Bali in 2002 reacted angryly to the sentence of the last conspirator who was brought to trial and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years ' imprisonment for his role in creating the explosive devices used in the attack.
He may be released within 15 years if he is granted parole.
A 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kut, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church bombings throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could have insisted that a person called a "explosive" because of his reputation as a bomb maker should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of the mother of Perth June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago.
As soon as she stopped crying, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
"I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the firing squad, " said Ms. Cortin AAP.
"I have to live every day knowing I won't have any more grandchildren and I won't see my daughters."
The "Sari" club was destroyed when a massive explosive device placed in an outside van was detonated immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma three times in a month and died in a life support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the plight of the other three members of the Jemaa Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the massacre — Amrosi, Muhlas and Imam Samudra — who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty the most.
To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds, that's not much.
Patek is the last person to take part in the Bali attack to stand trial.
He had been in hiding for almost a decade, but was finally detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where United States forces killed former Al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
In the course of the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence had testified: Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaida.
"He has not given up," said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he did not regret how much grief he had caused other people.
The verdict is on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the attack, which will take place later this year in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," Ms. Cortin said.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: "Air passengers can now use aircraft gadgets (but not call from a mobile phone)"
Airpassers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not speak on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Office on Thursday.
But passengers shouldn't expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly this change is being implemented will vary from airline to airline, says FAU administrator Michael Werta at a press conference.
The airlines will have to show FAU how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and installation regulations to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic devices in fixed-wing aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
"Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon," FAU stated.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They must not restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives them "good."
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane is down to land and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and steering, FAU stated.
Most of the new aircraft and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glaiding, President of the Association of Professional Cruisers, welcomed these changes.
"After the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option," Glading said.
We are frankly tired of feeling "school duty" when it comes to this issue.
But the Internet connection for surfing, e-mails, text messages, or downloading data will still be prohibited at a height of less than 10,000 feet, says the agency.
Passengers will be invited to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to aircraft.
So there's still no Words With Friends, the smart Internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the incident happened: the actor was taken off American Airlines for refusing to turn the device off while the plane was at the landing point.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still have to be put in the luggage compartment, because they can hurt someone if they fly all over the cabin.
Mobile phone calls in flight will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory authority over telephone calls is vested in the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU.
The FSA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Council, a national transport safety expert CBS News, stated that cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Telephones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know, thanks to the FCS, that they can interfere with cell towers when the plane is in the air," Rosenker said.
The Sectoral Advisory Committee set up by FAU to look into this issue recommended last month that the Government allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, there has been an increase in pressure on FAA to ease restrictions on its use.
Critics, such as the state senator Claire McCaskill, claim there are no compelling security reasons for the prohibitions.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to one third of the passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
FAU began to limit passenger use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by FAU as being resistant to electronic interference.
The airlines have been offering the passengers Wi-Fi at cruise altitude for several years.
Fixed-wing aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are adapted to increase the use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, said Wert.
Today ' s electronic devices usually emit radio signals much lower than the previous generations of devices.
Electronic book reading devices, for example, emit only minimal signals when the pages are turned.
But the signals get stronger when the devices load or send the data.
The company Amazon.com was among those who sought to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company loaded the entire airliner with its electronic book-reading devices in Kindle and flew it to check for problems, but never found them.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Air Passengers stated that he considered interference with the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only individual reports from pilots confirming that devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of those messages were very old.
The committee recommended, however, that FAS allow pilots to require passengers to switch off devices during landings in reduced visibility conditions.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers who now use many technological devices.
"We are pleased that the FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Doe, Director General of the United States Tourism Association.
Motor schools will be able to conduct driving examination
The driving licence examination will be open to private companies with their own computer-based driveway.
This is written by Commersant with reference to the draft Government Regulation "On the Admission to Driving Vehicles".
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such autodromes in Russia.
The students of such "privileged" vehicle schools are expected to read the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Motor Inspectorate will monitor the examination every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30 per cent of the theoretical examinations and more than 20 per cent of the site do not pass the first time, such a school will be denied six months' privileges.
The technical requirements for the motorways contained in the draft Government Regulation shall enter into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also includes requirements for driving two-wheelers.
From 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will be required to pass an examination in urban traffic to obtain category A rights.
Moreover, since 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers will be required to obtain Russian rights after passing the examination.
A bird that was airlifted to a safe place from a drilling rig in the North Sea has been released back into the wild.
The bird, which was transported by air to the shore after being found exhausted at an oil tower in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was placed in a helicopter headed for Aberdeen last month, and was then taken out by the Scottish Unit of the Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (SPCA) at the rescue centre in Alloa.
The manager of the centre, Colin Ceddon, said: "This water shepherd is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has entered a zone of strong winds over the North Sea."
Looks like the bird was exhausted and able to find shelter on the oil tower.
He added, "She was unable to take off again, so we were approached for help."
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is Europe's elite ready to run business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives to determine what changes Britain's wealth and jobmakers want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK, business, and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 business leaders representing a wide section of business in the UK by size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently seeking export opportunities outside Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and difficult process of reforming the complicated institutions of the EU.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from competition regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with a single market, with business representatives saying that the cost of regulation from Brussels now outweighs the benefits of being in the European trade zone — even 40 per cent of the major enterprises traditionally the most pro-European of all companies agreed.
Last and foremost, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority wants Britain to pursue a change of contract and a trade-based relationship with the EU, rather than a policy-based one.
This result, which has been observed among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on a "significant change" that will restore power back to Britain.
The stakes are high — bringing about changes in the treaty and more favourable conditions for Britain will result in a 16 per cent shift in the vote to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British business supports his plan to review the terms of Britain's membership in the EU.
It also shows that business expects that the review will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back to Britain.
The best conditions for British business are possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards closer economic and financial integration.
Priority must be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and our survey shows that for business this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels's regulatory activities.
U.S. Special Services are listening to the Pope's personal phone.
The Vatican's activities are under the vigilant control of American intelligence services.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection indicate that the US intelligence was auditioning all of the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now has strong custody of Pope Francis.
His phone started bugging even before he became head of the Vatican.
The election process for the new Pope was also monitored.
Which in the U.S. was particularly important.
Special Services has connected to the cell phones of the Cardinals who gathered in Rome to select another Pope.

Snowboardist for the Olympic Bill was specially photographed
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a commemorative note on the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
Nominal bill - 100 rubles.
But online bloggers are already actively ironic about the memorial note.
Following the presentation of the Olympic Bill on 30 October, they noted that a picture of a snowboardist from a banknote could be found in photo banks.
In particular, there is a free photo of StockExchange, where the photograph is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in the Photoshop class published on the Russian website "Mega-Observation" on January 18, 2011.
It was also used in the RugGear smartphone commercial.
The Olympic banknote is blue and blue.
On the one hand, there is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, and on the other, there is a view of the Olympic Stadium and Jar-bird.
The author of the banknote design is Pavel Bushouev, who won a contest among the students of the St. Petersburg Repin Academy of Arts.
The presentation noted that several sports were considered, such as skiing, freestyle and skiing, but that they eventually chose a snowboard as a relatively young sport.
According to the Izves source, close to the BC, the regulator does not care about the public's opinion about the wide distribution of the snowboardist's image from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But Goznak isn't too worried about the noise around the Olympic bill.
The Head of State's Press Service, Natalia Nikiforova, said "Izves", that all reasoning about plagiarism is ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the note will turn to the right, the photo on the web to the left, and Nikiforov has specified.
The person at the photo shoot to create the bill was taken from different points, then the final image was selected, and on it it was a typical snowboardist position.
It also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic bill, as the artist had been paid for his work.
In the view of the experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill was positive.
The recognition of the image on the bill - plus for its promotion - is considered by Alexey Popović's executive director of the Rus Brenda.
It is difficult to prove a 100 per cent similarity between the images on the bills and in the photo banks, so it is unlikely that there will be any lawsuits against the intellectual property against the image.
The Olympic banknote first appeared in China, and a 10 Yuan banknote was released for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislative prohibitions forced Russians to drink less beer.
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
By their way of thinking, the country's beer consumption will remain the same next year, at best.
Although the businessmen were originally expecting growth.
This is a bad year for them: sales have fallen by 7 per cent.
The head of one of the country's largest brewery companies, Isaac Sheppes, President of the Council of the Union of Russian Beerbirds, reported all of this at the 3rd Annual Conference of the Adam Smith Institute, "Tovars of Daily Demand in Russia", which just concluded in Moscow.
It discussed public regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market had already declined by 18 per cent, as the regulation of the brewery industry in the production of and trafficking in beer - a small drink - had increased significantly in recent years, reported Shapes.
In no country in the world is there such a severe restriction on the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of new and illogical prohibitions that are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewery commented that many legislative prohibitions designed to reduce alcohol abuse were not very effective, yet new initiatives were constantly emerging.
The most painful beer producers have been the ban on selling liquor in kiosks since this year.
"We immediately lost 35,000 consumers," said Isaac Sheppes.
Next year, the brewers have two projections.
Optimistic is the one Sheppes was talking about: sales of foam beverage will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic, another two to three percent.
In order to save their profits, businessmen have to move from mass consumer varieties to the premium class: the beer will be smaller, but it will cost more.
However, the radical consequences of the drop in sales with a small amount of alcohol are yet to be seen.
"My observations indicate that the level of alcohol abuse remains at roughly the same level," said the drug doctor Alexey Sotnikov.
True, there has been an increase in the proportion of patients who use hard drink surrogates, as well as those who have been "adhesive" on alcohol-containing drinks such as Jaguar, whereas ten years ago it was "drink" alcohol that prevailed.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford road factory in Allwoljsk.
As the unions say, all the laid-off have been compensated.
However, the issue of reducing production in the region is much more acute than the problems of workers.
A member of the regional Zacksa Alexei Etmanov said at the meeting that at the Ford factory in Allwolzsk, some 600 people had been reduced.
He stated that this had occurred as early as September: at that time, about 600 people had left the plant under a voluntary termination programme, which had been developed with the organization ' s trade union.
"Golden parachutes" of several salaries were offered to workers who decided to quit of their own free will.
As a result, the vast majority left their jobs of their own free will.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think it's gonna stop there.
However, the authorities did not plan to adopt any programmes in the next two years to support the difficult regional enterprises," he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large job losses when adopting the budget.
In Ford, this information is neither denied nor confirmed.
We're waiting for an answer from the company, and as soon as he shows up, we're gonna publish it.
We've been talking about cutting down workers at Ford's factory in Allwolzsk for a long time.
For example, the company's plans to dismiss 600 people became known as early as September.
The factory had previously declared the production of cars suspended.
The decline in the demand for Ford cars in Russia was cited as a reason at the factory.
According to Petrostat, industrial production in Lenoblati declined by 5.4 per cent in the nine months of 2013.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, it will be possible to use mobile phones during take-off and landing.
The new rules for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing of the aircraft have been approved in the United States and are reported by BBC.
It is expected that United States airlines will allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the voyage, and the new regulations will be in place by the end of 2013.
However, communication with the Internet for receiving and sending e-mail will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometres.
Because of the risk of interference with aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communications will continue to be prohibited.
The passengers of the flights will thus be allowed to read electronic books, play tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of electronic devices throughout the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile aircraft on aircraft and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, as in the United States, current standards for the use of electronic devices in flight could also be revised in Britain.
A new name, the Brad Circle, was finally established in the United States for the "Russian Mafia".
This week, the blacklist of the Russian mob in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Department of Finance has introduced three Russian representatives, two Uzbek citizens and an Israeli into the "Brat Circle".
One of the Russians was a famous singer, Grigory Leps, whom the US is suspected of transporting money for members of the band.
There are 22 individuals on the U.S. blacklist involved in the Brad Circle and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts had doubts about the existence of such an organization.
"The claim of the Brad Circle is more like an attempt to unite fragmented criminal groups," said an expert on organized crime and a professor at the University of New York, Mark Galeotti.
In his view, the "Brat Circle" reflects a popular perception of "Russian mafia".
"I haven't met anyone in the Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else to confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," quoted Mr. Galeotti as the American Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti also agrees with George Mason University Professor Liz Shelley.
"If they're working together, it's more like a criminal network, but not an organization," says the Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "Brat Circle" brought together more close Russian thieves in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Santa Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed last January.
For example, the activities of Lashi Shuchanashvili and Zachariah Kalashov, who had completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Grandpa Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was a nephew of Grandpa Hassan.
He noted, however, that some individuals had nothing to do with Usoyan.
In his view, they were all rather united by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Gregory Leps, Russian President Vladimir Putin's favorite singer, in the Brad Circle has attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American partner colleagues, which led to the decision why he was placed on such lists, said the spokesperson for Head of State, Dmitri Peskov.
In any event, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
Head of Gazprom Alexei Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field
The start of the construction of the Southern Flow gas pipeline in Bulgaria marked the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
"The construction of the Bulgarian section of the Southern Flow gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, began today," said Chairman Gazprom Alexey Miller in his statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The Southern Flow is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The contract dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, where most of Russia's European gas is located, increases the risk level for ordinary routes, says officials.
Miller stated that direct association with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries had been eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the Southern Flow at a reduced price as soon as the entire project becomes operational in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should start in other countries further along the pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning, in the Sarat district, the driver of the Peugeot car took off on the 115 km of the Odessa Renee road and ran into a bus carrying six people.

Two YMCA employees have been charged with sexual offences even before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission has learned.
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with sexual offences against children prior to bringing charges against a child care worker in Caringbach, Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
But the commission's opening statement stated that it had "never dealt with cases of sexual abuse of children within its organization".
Philip Hare, Chief Executive Officer, was asked about one case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences and another in which an instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted of sexual offences against children under his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Fernes, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, but he didn't know about the second.
He admitted that YMCA had also been inaccurate in its introductory speech to the commission, arguing that "there were external audits by YMCA that admitted that YMCA was at the forefront of children's safety".
The evidence submitted to the Commission indicates that YMCA was informed that it received the second of the four possible quality audits carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined YMCA when he was 21 years old, admitted that he and the lower management had failed by hiring the Lord, and had also failed to ensure that staff understood their obligations to report violations of child safety policies.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the assumption that YMCA corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lord's child safety violations.
Staff testified that they had observed violations, including the Lord being alone with the children, taking care of them personally, placing them on his knees, saying that he loved one of them and allowed them to play their mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was led by the Lord and asked to be trained to protect her children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she had found Jackie Barnat, a child welfare manager at the YMCA branch in Karingbach, who was the head of the Lord, "very scary and often difficult to access".
The Executive Director said that he did not accept staff members ' explanations that it was awkward for them to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said that their friendship with the Lord had led them away from the need to report him.
Mr. Hare said that he had presented his opinion to the YMCA board of New South Wales that the lesson for the organization from the "accident with Jonathan Lord" did not "relate to the provision of information" by the staff, and the board agreed with it.
Mr. Hare stated that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations had been made by the YMCA Director General for Child Care, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was intended to prevent the damage of evidence, but that it was "overdoing" and that the decision was not well implemented.
YMCA New South Wales was not a child-friendly organization during Jonathan Lord ' s work during the period 2009 - 2011, and the commission was informed by an expert on child abuse, Professor Stephen Smolbone of Griffith University.
He said that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, selection, guidance, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing is postponed until December 20th.
Fashion Week in São Paulo.
She's not just a model in her home country, she's a real star.
Although Giselle Bundschen left her job for a while, distracted by motherhood, she came here on purpose these days and this week of Defile.
A month's absence did not prevent her from keeping her seat on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the world's highest-paid supermodel.
This time, she was a member of the Rings.
Fashion week finals are usually the most interesting shows.
It's like a Lino Villaventura stylist.
Marke is over 30 years old, in parallel with the production of the luxury pret-a-porta, and the designer is active in the theatre and in the cinema, making performances and developing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 firms and companies involved in the textile industry and fashion world participated in the closing fashion week in São Paulo.
It is one of the most dynamic areas of production, employing more than 2 million Brazilians, and has an annual turnover of $50 billion.
Tony Blair said he'd take the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but admitted that return was unlikely.
On the eve of the evening, in an interview marking the fifth anniversary of his resignation, a 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after 10 years as leader, Blair has largely avoided British policy debates, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Quartet of Middle East peacekeepers.
When asked if he would return to the position of Prime Minister, Blair, according to London's Evening Standard, he said, "Yes, of course, but I don't think that's gonna happen, so..."
Milana's chief coach, Massimiliano Allegre, expressed regret for the result of the 10th round of the Italian Championship with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failure in the start-up was due to a series of injuries to leading players.
I'm sorry we couldn't win," he says, "Tmw the words of Allegory."
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn't let Lazio do anything.
The second Romans added up, but in general, I can't say we've lost concentration.
I should've won.
Last season, we did the task of getting into the Champion League.
We're behind schedule now, but it's due to a series of injuries to key football players.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Look at Kaca, who held a high-level meeting.
Experts of the Conversatory Events, moving to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year prize, knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months earlier, who took his first steps, this little kid and his pet Shetland pony, Toffy, ran three tours to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This indistinguishable couple — the same height — received high marks for their appearance, behaviour, and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnibenk Mount Sports Center in Radri, near Cardiff.
When he went out to the public in front of men and women in elegant caps, he moved his hat and proudly spent two years in Toffy's circle.
The judges praised Fenton for his long-standing innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffy got the highest grade for appearance and character.
Fenton was given a gift to Toffy on his third birthday last March, and since then he's been studying with a Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffy make up a beautiful duet."
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second performance with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
A total stranger in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abb Weil in South Wales, is following in the footsteps of her Aunt Sharon Howels, who has been making horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howels said, "All the public was stunned, and everyone was screaming and clapping."
He ran through the sand the whole length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did a fine job.
Fenton's crazy about animals -- he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
Judging by the way he started, he will soon be participating in the "Loshadi of the Year" — and I am sure he will speak well.
The representative of this annual horse exhibition said, "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to treat his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The judges commended Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and for the way they presented themselves at the show ring.
They assess the coherence of the pony and the manufacturer's performances — Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper that published the call "should be reorganized"
The Chinese newspaper, which had published on the front page a call for the release of the accused in the slander of a reporter, must be reorganized, reporting to the press regulator.
The newspaper New Express, published in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yungzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with State ownership.
Now the New Express must go through a "full error correction process," as the regulator reports.
The order for "correction" came from the Guangdong Department of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express newspaper published several false reports about Zoomlion's listed company between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The New Express editorial manual has been misdirected," says the regulator's statement.
He states that it has been decided "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yungzhou in the form of the revocation of his reporter's licence".
He also "directed Youngcheng Evening News Group to make a full correction of the New Express errors and recommended that it investigate the situation-related responsible newspaper and immediately amend the New Express leadership".
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, in which he claimed financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published on the front page two calls for his release, stating that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on State television, admitting that he had published false articles for money.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust," he said to the public broadcasting company CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my guilt.
Following Mr. Chen's confession, the New Express published an apology on the front page, stating that the newspaper had failed to properly verify his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
The experts say that the practice of extracting confessions in China continues to be widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing someone to self-incriminating.
A U.S. tunnel — Mexico for drug trafficking — equipped with its own railway — has been discovered.
Found one of the most complex drug-smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel as four-by-three feet wide as one of the most difficult secret moves they have ever discovered.
This tunnel, which has a length of nearly six football fields, links warehouses near the city of Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, United States.
The area is filled with undetectable warehouses, which facilitates the clandestine loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled through it, as the authorities claimed.
According to judicial documents, law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officers, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution purposes.
If convicted, they face prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were found in Central Mexico after a harvest of marijuana in October, which presented drug cartels with the difficult task of delivering their product quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage length of approximately 700 yards, equipped with rail tracks, from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two depots in San Diego.
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November of this year and have informed BELTA's correspondent at the Ministry of Labour and Social Security's General Directorate of Pensions.
From 1 November this year, the average wage of workers in the Republic, as applied in the previous recalculation of pensions, will be adjusted with an increase of 5.4 per cent, and a corresponding recalculation of the labour pension will be made in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on the increase of pensions.
As a result of the recalculation, it is estimated that retirement pensions will increase by an average of 5.3 per cent as of November.
The average old-age pension will be Br2 million.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million inhabitants of the Republic.
The expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus on higher pensions will increase by Br274.3 billion per month as of November this year.
At the same time as the calculation of employment pensions, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and pension supplements will be recosted in November of this year due to an increase in the average per capita subsistence budget.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government at the level of Br1 million,530 - 2.1 per cent higher than it was during the period from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, the minimum labour pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and pension supplements will be increased by 2.1 per cent as of 1 November.

British police give Assanju a notice of extradition
The British police today gave notice of extradition to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they had given a 40-year-old Australian a "official demand to surrender" requesting him to appear at the police station, adding that if he failed to do so, he would then be arrested.
Assanju faces extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, asking that South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "has given a 40-year-old man an official demand to surrender, which requires him to come to the police station on the day and time of our choice", as reported by the spokesperson.
He continues to violate the terms of his bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the notification to the police.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible charges of espionage following the publication of more than 250,000 American diplomatic speeches on the WikiLeaks website, which opposes secrecy.
Driver driving at 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs, fined £1000
The car was fined £1,000 for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between its legs.
35-year-old Andrew Howie from Tiptree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintre on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a beverage between his legs.
In the Court of Justice, Colchester Howie found that he had been accused of driving without due diligence and attention.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driving licence resulted in him receiving a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also required to pay £90 and an extra fee to help victims of crime in the amount of £100.
A tax for foreign real estate owners will cause the London bubble to burst
Treasury had completed a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but was awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, had introduced a state duty rate of 7 per cent for houses worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who chose to own houses in partnership rather than as natural persons.
So far, the state's residential estate in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to £708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, is already exceeding the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook stated: "After the increase in government spending on expensive houses and the introduction of related anti-evasive legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is understated, regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system."
"But this move may lead some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners will not want to sell it," he added.
First-class real estate, the top 5-10 percent of the housing market at a price, in a rich southwest London belt, which runs from Fulham to Wimbledon, has grown by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a survey by Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady growth of 5.6 per cent annually, but they were eclipsed by a rapidly growing "family market" with rising prices in the south-west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent).
Scientists have shed light on how the dog's tail moves are related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that happy dogs hang their tail on the right side (from the dog's point of view), while troubled dogs wave their tail on the left side mostly.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can see and respond to these subtle differences in tail swinging.
Professor Georgio Vallorigara, a neurobiologist at Trent University, says: "It is well known that people's left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in creating incentives that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we tried to look at it from other species.
He added that just like a human, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to a variety of tails of other dogs, researchers observed animals while watching movies about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of animal heartbeat and analysed their behavior.
Perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes they go the other way.
Professor Vallorigara said, "We showed dogs a video of dogs, either naturalistic versions or silhouette, to get rid of any other distortions, and we could manipulate the tail and direct the tail more to the left or to the right."
When animals saw that otherwise the non-expressing dog moved its tail to the right (in terms of a waving dog's tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was inclined largely to the left (newly in terms of a waving dog's tail), their heartbeat was increasing and they seemed anxious.
Professor Vallorigara said that he didn't think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should be worried about or not.
He observes: "If there are several encounters with other dogs and their tail is often in one direction associated with more friendly behaviour, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say that these results can provide owners, veterinarians, and trainers with a better understanding of their animal emotions.
An expert in dog behavior, John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher at Bristol University Veterinary School, said that this was not the first study to test whether the left and right sides were relevant to dogs.
Last year, a group of scientists from Lincoln University discovered that dogs turn their heads left when they look at an aggressive dog and right if they look at a happy dog.
And in another scientific paper by Victoria University in Canada, he said, "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when her tail was swerving to the left than to the right instead of becoming alarmed, the opposite behavior towards Italian research."
He said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Where there is sufficient evidence for different mammals that two hemispheres of the brain are being used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Artic Monkeys are putting off a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's illness.
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the concert in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This Sheffield band was supposed to be performing on the town's Hydro concert set on Friday.
However, the vocalist Alex Turner's illness forced them to reschedule the show.
This statement was made after she was forced to postpone the LG Arena concert at Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys reported: "Following the decision to move the show to Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical attention, Arctic Monkeys should also postpone the show on the Hydro site in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November".
"Alex Turner was diagnosed with laryngitis, and unfortunately he is not able to perform."
The LG Arena show in Birmingham is now on November 20, and the Glasgow show on the Hydro playground is on November 21.
All tickets to these shows remain valid.
We want to apologize to all ticket owners for any inconvenience they may have experienced.

Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February.
Pope Francis will set up new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are the ones who elect the Pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually participate in the selection of his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, after the Cardinal reached the age of 80, he can no longer take part in the Papa election, which is the prerogative of the group of 120 "Cardinal electors".
In announcing this news, the Vatican Press Secretary, Father Federico Lombardi, said that a meeting of all the current cardinals, known as the Consistorium, would be held before the ceremony.
"Papa Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consulate in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from around the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to decrease.
He said that Dad usually calls as many cardinals as it takes to get the number of cardinal electors back to 120, as well as as as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
The referendum next year will be important because it will be the first since Francis's election in March this year, according to Valero.
So far, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe, and especially in favour of Italy.
"It would be interesting to see if the new Pope would appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a negligible number of cardinals.
They will also be the first to be chosen cardinals since the formation of the French Cardinal Council, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world charged with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad made his own decisions.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that "it is possible" that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we weren't in this situation before — this is the first time we've had this.
Valero said that the Popes used to appoint the cardinal bishops from the major parishes, but Francis "is full of surprises, so we don't know who he's going to call."
GM withdraws a number of new pickup trucks in the U.S. to improve seat backs
General Motors Co. withdraws almost 19,000 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks and the 2014 GMC Sierra model to address problems with manual seat back adjustment, following a Friday notification from U.S. vehicle safety regulators.
For some of the pick-up trucks, the front seats may have a defect in the back angle machine.
As a result, seat backs do not meet federal vehicle head restraints safety standards.
"The head restraint may not adequately protect the occupant by increasing the risk of injury in the rear impact of a vehicle" is stated in the notice posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
The withdrawn models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The production of GM pickup trucks began in June and represents the most important production of the car for the leading American car manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM reported a defect to truck owners in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider the notice to the owners due to the 16-day termination of the Government, which reduced the increase in car sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, grew by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as GM announced on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickup trucks and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM stock on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
A cry of despair for Obama's voter
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change.
He says Obama allowed Republican obstructionism to undermine commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with Obama ' s reformed health system website, drone attacks
The Obama campaign memoirs of 2008 are a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard University.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me in times of depression in the second year of the medical school and restore me to a sense of hope.
It's called "Witness for Victory," and it's a memoir about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients tonight, and I go to bed, this book brings me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people, and the performances may have taken a breath.
The election victory was impressive, and leading news programmes paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists was supposed to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his level of support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a rude awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It is difficult to recall those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, changes have indeed taken place.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of a law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, to the repeal of the rule of "Don't ask, don't say," the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health choices and the closure of the Guantánamo base, among others.
But after countless times, when I stood on the side of the Obama administration, defending her in front of colleagues and peers, I ran out of explanations I could provide.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain permission to wire foreign leaders or to hit innocent children in other countries with drones.
He could not explain the collection of data on American privacy by the National Security Agency or the persecution of public figures that revealed government misconduct.
He cannot explain the murder of the United States citizen Anwar Al-Awlaqi without trial or the failure to respect the limits of public funding and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the report's conclusion that the White House's efforts to silence the media have been "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration".
More recently, it cannot justify the failure to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the Accessible Health Care Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have realized at the age of 18 that the leadership might run counter to the political campaigns that preceded it?
It is clear that holding an elected office is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be shaped by an opposition political party and by random events such as the beating in New Town.
Nevertheless, all the examples I have listed above show that they were to a large extent their own choice of administration.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, and he seemed unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I thought that in his second term, Obama, freeing himself from the pressures of future elections, would live up to the hopes we have heard for so long.
However, when Obama's rating fell below 45 percent this week, it became much more difficult to return in 2008 through this book.
It makes me miss a lot of promises that have gone away.
This week, I read that part of the book that described how Clinton had caused Obama a deafening defeat in the initial elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting to analyse the reasons for his failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
"I want us to return our appeal," he said.
"We must remember who we are."
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.
The views expressed in the commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest with regard to parental leave.
Deputy billionaire Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in childcare leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining magnate, who has an unresolved dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, made this statement at a time when he was trying to escape questions about whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be decisive in deciding to lift carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from political action.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters were pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether they would be granted leave or not," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer to be the winner of the Sanshain-Kost seat of the Fairfax constituency, with 53 votes cast after the vote was counted.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the voting process in order to expedite the process.
Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget's daughters.
Should a decision be taken on these elections two months after we have voted?
"We need to have a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system to come in, enter our data into the computer, vote immediately, and get the result at 6:30 that night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
It seems strange to use a pencil these days.
The Electoral Commission was exploring possibilities for electronic voting and had recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and would take his new job "very seriously".
Public office involves the service of society.
"We seek no reward other than the thanks of history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment," he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily suspended two traders from its foreign exchange unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is further evidence that global scrutiny by regulators of alleged manipulations in the foreign exchange market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world's largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended during an ongoing investigation that coincides with the LIBOR interbank manipulation scandal.
By refusing to comment on suspensions, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
"Our ongoing investigation of this matter is ongoing, and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and our other regulators," reported to the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, well-informed people said that RBS had handed over e-mail records and instant messages that had been received and sent by its former trader to the British regulatory body, the Financial Control Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted leave to his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of European spot bidding at Citi, left this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior foreign exchange trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher ' s instant communications team included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to knowledgeable people.
UBS reported this week that it took action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said that he was investigating alleged currency-market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators worldwide — the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers conspired to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal checks or received requests for information from regulatory authorities, and said familiar individuals.
Banks have been looking at instant messages and e-mails over the years in search of cases of wrongdoing.
The audit news has fuelled traders in activities that have been one of the largest sources of income in recent years for trading units of investment banks, which this year, however, has encountered difficulties because low currency volatility has reduced opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the seriousness of the situation, saying that a vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the Senior Trader, despite the huge volume of daily trade in the foreign exchange market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increased use by banks of their internal platforms means that "you can start influencing the market at a very low price".
This news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of its stock-tenders at the London Exchange this week after it had caused losses of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue has been localized," Credit Suisse reported.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama's health law
The U.S. Supreme Court today has ruled that Barack Obama's landmark health law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By voting 5 against 4, the judges ruled that separate orders under the Patient Protection and Accessible Health Act requiring citizens to acquire health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine were constitutional in accordance with the Government ' s tax authority.
The Chief Justice, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page Act and further held that the requirement of the Health Act that states increase compliance with Medicaid, otherwise they would lose all federal funding for Medicaid, was not unconstitutionally coercive.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Business have filed an action to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is the cause of discord?
In the State Duma, in the framework of the "open rostrum", politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the suggestions made was to ban football in the North Caucasus because it was a game of scandal and discord.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled recent events in Biryulev and said that in order to reduce the "level of social tension", politicians and the media must be correct in their statements.
He must have meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinovsky, who in a television show threatened to encircle the Caucasus with barbed wire if they didn't want to limit their fertility...
All speakers referred to measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and to measures to harmonize relations among the peoples of Russia, which had given rise to confusion.
Maxim Grigoriev stated that the events in Biryulev were "a model conflict that could have been predicted", but "there are too many people and entities to answer for these questions," and seven children have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism that Europe had long practised against migrants had failed, according to the socialist, and it was necessary to find a way.
The historian Yuri Petrov had great hopes for a new, unified history book.
"It is still necessary to create a handbook on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zuganov proposed criminalizing "calls to dismember Russia": "If the US says on radio that Alaska should hand over Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Girinovsky tried very hard not to inflate.
As usual, he blamed all the journalists who put the sick and the acute national problems on the public debate: "There's not much to say in the debate!"
Vladimir Vasiliev, leader of the Uniting Russia faction, immediately advised journalists to conclude a charter and agree to talk carefully on the subject, and then the same commitments could be made by politicians.
We have some 30 laws that regulate migration, and Mr. Vasiliev stated that the whole order is in place.
As an example, he cited a law that held regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-national peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andricchenko's enthusiasm for this law has not been shared: there is "no clear perception of what the adaptation of migrants is, about its mechanisms and limits.
This means that actors will treat the scope of these powers differently.
Moreover, the municipalities do not have the human resources necessary to deal with such complex issues, do not have the means to do so, and do not have any methodological advice that they can use, the centre provides them with ...
The head of the Dominan Committee for Nationalities, Gajimet Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special agency with the threatening name "Ministry of National Security", which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who led a similar agency in the 1990s, which was subsequently abolished, opposed.
It's enough to have a special person at the federal level, a "minister without a portfolio" who could be approached if anything happened.
"We walk on the edge, the projectiles break apart, it's very important that representatives of different ethnicities and religions work together against provocations, and this work should receive decent information support," said the representative of the RPC for the association with the Society of Allvolod Chaplin.
There should be no neutrality on the part of the State with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious ideologies, in its view.
Here, Oleg Nealov led the discussion into an unexpected course: "A lot more talented than in Chechnya or Dagestan is still to be looked for, but they are being pushed into the wrong path, the wrong way," he said.
"The wrong road" is the development of football: "The football player is beaten by the whole crowd, the flags are torched, the comrades are stoned...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another sport called rugby...
"They won't be equals in the world in this sport!" said the right-wing word.
No one will play in the rugby in the Caucasus! Mr. Girinovsky immediately intervened.
You're gonna offer them kerling!
You need to know the country's particulars, it's like a Georgian "The Pickle" to offer."
In Jaroslavla, the representatives of the Moscow Club, during the game with the local club, distinguished themselves with wild behavior at the stands.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
Arthur Grigoriantz, head of the control and disciplinary committee of the Russian Federation, reported that Kuban was fined 500,000 rubles and that Philippe PAPENKOV, a CE correspondent, was transferred from the Football House.
Such sanctions against the Reddar Club were imposed for setting fire to the Dagestan flag by fans on the rostrum during the 14th round of the home game against Angi.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from the EMPL.
We've been looking into all the available materials.
A fine of 500,000 rubles has been imposed on Cuban viewers for their misconduct.
Google, Samsung, Huavei patent suits have been filed against Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent suits against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, whose price it interrupted at Nortel's bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which purchased $4.5 billion of Nortel patents, filed a patent infringement claim with the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, HTC Corp, Huavei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help to compare key words of Internet search with their corresponding advertising, the claim states, which is the foundation of Google's search business.
Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not available and did not comment.
Samsung, Huavei and HTC make phones that work on Android's Google operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google offered the original $900 million price for Nortel patents.
Google increased the price several times, eventually offering an entire $4.4 billion.
After losing the Northel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, and in this deal the determining factor was in part the Motorola patent library.
"Despite the unsuccessful attempt to purchase at auction the patents that are the subject of the suit, Google has violated and continues to violate them," says the lawsuit.
Rockstar claims increased damages from Google because he claims that the violation of Google patent rights is intentional under the claim.
Egypt takes the oath of the first freely elected president
Muhammad Mursi takes the oath, but his day of celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Mursi promised "a new Egypt" when he took the oath, becoming the country's first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi was also the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and fifth head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black robes at the courthouse on the bank of Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We seek a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi during a ceremony broadcast live on State television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American entity from the Muslim Brothers, a fundamentalist group that for the most part of its 84 years of existence was a banned organization that was targeted by successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Mursi arrived with a small convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and unlike the Presidential post of Mubarak, the movement was stopped for only a short time to allow his convoy to pass on a normally busy road linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Although Mursi was mocked as a non-charismatic "save wheel" by the Brothers, his personal prestige has increased dramatically since his victory and Friday performance, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists, but also for all those who want to complete the 2011 rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges in a wooden chamber where he took the oath.
Morsi later went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra that fulfilled the national anthem, during which he stood at the "Serene" counter.
A military officer, Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi, was present.
His visit was met with the slogan "Armenia and the People - One Hand", which chanted hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a pillar of secular education, Cairo University became a pillar of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where a rebellion broke out that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and promised to restore the presidency, which had been deposed by the military council that took over the affairs of the deposed leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before a court rather than a parliament, as is customary, he does the will of the military, which is a sign that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theater gestures.
The next meeting of the Association of Machine Manufacturers of the Tumen Region was held at the Jalutorov Automobile Plant.
The event included the launch of a new line for the manufacture of electrical welding pipes from steel.
According to the business director Denis Gribanov, a marketing study on the steel market in the Tumen region was conducted in 2011 with the arrival of the new owner.
It turns out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electrical welding pipes per month.
It was then decided to change the plant ' s profile and install equipment for its production.
Already this year, more than 7,000 tons of production have been shipped.
More than 120 million rubles were invested in the plant, says Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new station was launched, which allows for an expansion of the range.
The plant produces both a small section of the pipe, which is used for greenhouses, small construction and furniture, and a large one for the construction industry.
Plans to reach the level of 50,000 tons of output per year, which would account for about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen region.
Despite the shift to another activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - it now stands at 157, and in the plan for the purchase of new equipment - an increase of more than 50 employees.
The enterprise is undergoing retraining and the necessary specialists are drawn from existing ones.
It is planned to introduce a new longitudinal cutter of up to five millimetres next year, which will reduce the cost of production as well as another country, at a rate of 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is about to develop pipes that are used in housing and utilities.
The company ' s management aims to close up to 70 per cent of Tumen region ' s demand for these products.
Leonid Ostromov, Deputy Director of Investment Policy, advised that more attention should be paid to the modernization of the engineering industry when addressing the managers of the industry.
This is also the aim of government support for industry, which includes the reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and its leasing costs.
This year, 150 million roubles have been allocated for this purpose, two thirds of which have already been spent.
The last commission, which will review the grant contracts, accepts the documents from the enterprises before 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses the cost of local producers ' participation in international fairs.
For the coming year, the budget provided for 150 million roubles, which could be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for fairs, 3 million for energy conservation programmes.
The amount is reduced to 72 million roubles for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment produced in the southern Tumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostromov, this form of support will eventually cease because the reason for its introduction was to compensate for the mining tax that oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so, and subsidies are becoming direct spending obligations of the region.
Therefore, the Government has given priority to direct support to industrial enterprises rather than funding through them the oil industry.
Budget assistance will relate to investment projects to be implemented in the workplace.
Many business leaders have expressed concern about the evolving situation with the oil industry.
The grant for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage of the industry in the southern Tumen region, and it will be difficult to compete for the price of the medium band in Russia, where the lower-cost labour force is the only one.
In addition, the continuity of the new owner of the VC TNCs, Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders in the Tumen enterprises, is not clear.
The agreement for the implementation of the Uvata project expires in 2013 and no applications for extension have been received.
Currently, enterprises in the southern region that specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector are unable to form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
It remains to be seen whether taxes from oil produced in the Uvat region will be paid to the region or will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the deposits.
Tomich will work 240 hours for an extremist social media ad.
The Leninsky District Court of Tomsk sentenced a resident of the city to 240 hours of compulsory work, who posted on the social network a video of extremism, informed RIA Novosti on Friday of the representative of the Regional Court ' s press service.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted on his page on a popular social network video taped on the federal list of extremist materials.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation on "Actions aimed at inciting hatred and hostility, as well as the humiliation of human dignity, committed in public".
"The Leninsky District Court examined the case in a special manner and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned offence by imposing a penalty of 240 hours of compulsory work", said the agency's interviewer.
She added that the man fully confessed his guilt.
Azarov promised the Ukrainians a collapse in commodity prices after signing an association with the European Union.
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that prices in the country will fall significantly after the country has signed an association agreement with the European Union.
He spoke about this in his Facebook page with readers.
I can certainly say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, with the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area provision, customs duties on imports from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices would also have to fall.
"This is about goods coming from EU countries," wrote Azarov.
For other goods, the effect of the agreement on prices will not be that direct, but indirect.
But there shouldn't be any price increases either.
So the billboard reports, which have recently appeared quite extensively in our country, that association with the EU is a price increase, that's not quite the case, or to put it that way," Summarized Azarov.
Investigators check information on child abuse in Bijsk
On 29 October, the media reported that a kindergarten teacher in Biyska had locked a child in a basement for educational purposes.
The investigators are currently looking into all the circumstances and are also providing a legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten staff.
After the charge of bad taste, Eugenia Vasiliev spoke.
Eugenia Vasiliev, who has received close media attention for almost a year, has so far not commented on numerous press publications, both on thefts in the Ministry of Defence and on her personal relationship with the former Minister of Defence, Anatoly Heartykov, her poetry and her addiction to valuable things.
However, on 1 November, a figure in the Oboronservice case broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasiliev, she said, "The original task was of course exactly the same: to extract any negative information about the former Minister of Defence from me."
There was blackmail to testify, or I'm going to jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court, prove our innocence.
We're 100% sure of winning.
It can be concluded from the interview that perhaps Vasilyev was the one most affected by the words that she did not have good taste.
It is probably referring to the statement by the official representative of the UK, Vladimir Markin, that counterfeits were found in the collection of paintings collected by a figure in the Oboronservice case.
Among the property seized, there are a number of paintings that the hostess, confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, an art expert appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and were simply cheap forgerys," Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Then they admitted they weren't stolen from DOD, and they said I didn't taste good.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal issues?
I think it's just a mess," Vasilyeva says.
On the other hand, when asked if she admitted her guilt in any of the 12 criminal incidents she was accused of, Vasilyeva stated: "Of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation in question.
Just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the UK that Vasiliev was avoiding the examination of the criminal case file, the lawyer of the figuretian woman stated that he and his client were "not allowed by the investigator to familiarize himself with the case file".
What led to the revelations of Vasileva, who had not yet spoken to the press, who was under house arrest?
Perhaps as a woman, she couldn't not answer the bad taste charge?
Or are the journalists Komsomolka who claimed a few days ago that she was "into an even bigger trans under house arrest" because of news of Anatolia Serdyukov's reconciliation with his wife and his return to the family?
Viktor Baranets, a well-known military columnist of the KP, wrote in his article "Serdukov returned to his wife?": "The investigators do not rule out that after such a shock she may become more talkative during interrogation."
Previously, Vasiliev was charged with illegal sale of DOD real estate.

Flight Centre seems to have a reverse trend.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and is expecting record profits from recreational activities in Australia and the United Kingdom.
This tourism firm now expects its main annual gross revenue to be between $325 million and $340 million before taxation, compared to the previous projection of $305 million to $315 million.
If current benchmarks are achieved, this would represent a 12 to 17 per cent increase over the record $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
Executive Director Graham Turner said that Flight Centre received 8 per cent of its profits in the first half of the year and began the second half with good performance, especially on a week-long trip to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"In the period since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have a record high return in the full year before the deduction of interest and tax contributions," he said.
"This includes Australia and Britain, which usually bring us the biggest profits."
In Australia, the recreational business recovered in the second half of the year, compensating for a somewhat weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in the UK, the Flight Centre business performed well in leisure, while corporate clients spent less.
Her business in the United States compensated for the losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half of the year and is expected to make a profit for the third full year in a row.
Last night, the Flight Centre stock increased by 3 cents to $38.20.
On 31 October, Barnaul police discovered two playrooms.
The first one worked in the Industrial District on Flying Street.
At the time of the audit, there was a game going on in the establishment.
The club counted 24 machine guns.
Another play club was found in the Lenin district on Anton Petrov Street.
There were 20 arcade machines used here.
Russia's UMAD on Barnaul reports that administrative materials have been prepared under the article "Illicit organization and gambling".
The tech's been removed.
In the near future, material on these facts will be sent to the industrial and Leninian courts of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, the perpetrator killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are looking for a criminal who massacred two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
According to New Region, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Sverdlov province, the day before, two women with signs of violent death were found dead in the Kirov district of the Ural capital following a fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential home on the street of Uralsk.
The victims were soon identified.
They were found to be sisters, one of whom was a 44-year-old Yekaterinburg resident, and the other a 33-year-old resident of Orenburg province.
They rented an apartment that burned down a few days ago.
His investigation took personal control of the chief police officer in Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs agencies were working on various versions of the murder and were checking the alibi of previously tried citizens and those who were prone to such acts.
It also establishes the purpose for which women have rented an apartment and where they have lived before, what they have done and who they have been in contact with.
Schools called for greater attention to mathematics, orthography and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th - century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British art literature from 1914 onwards.
The examination will also include "out-of-programme texts" to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, students will be required to take a separate final language examination, with strong recommendations for selecting English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is due to produce new curricula tomorrow in English and mathematics, the first subject to radical revision.
It will make changes to other major subjects next year.
A separate regulatory body for the OFQUAL examinations will present a revised structure for the secondary school graduation examinations, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking in the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there was "a broad consensus that we must reform our examination system in order to restore public confidence", insisting that the school finals would be "more complex, more ambitious and more stringent".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has about 138 hours of schooling.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to mathematics in the schedule, coalition sources said that the large-scale school math finals, combined with the higher rating table ratio, are likely to provide an incentive for schools to provide additional education in this subject.
The curriculum will focus more on "real-life goals", including financial mathematics.
Hahe tickets will cost 2,200 rubles to tourists
As of tomorrow, tourists will start taking ships to the air pillow from the Bohemian in Hayhe.
For those who want to go to China, it means extra expenses.
The puma ticket has traditionally been much more expensive than the boat.
According to AmurASSO's reference service, the normal ticket cost would be 2,200 roubles.
Travel through the comfort hall will cost 2,800 rubles.
As a matter of fact, this season's tickets didn't get expensive: the same price was paid by tourists and last spring, and a year ago in the fall.
Dmitri Beardev: GDP growth of the Russian Federation is not sufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitrymedev considers the Russian Federation's GDP growth rate to be insufficient, and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of credit for business and changing the structure of the Russian economy, based on innovation, informs Reuters.
We planned GDP growth this year around 3%, maybe a little bit more.
It's going to be a little less than 2% real.
Against a background of recession in a number of countries in Europe, it seems to be not bad, but it is not bad enough for us, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries and, in general, has to be faster in order to develop.
It is now very important that Russian companies, Russian businesses, receive normal loans at a normal price - the first thing to do," the Head of Government stressed.

Visit to mud, rivers and the jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bvelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwellet and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients
There aren't many doctors in this West African country, just one for 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile device.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main heroes of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 main heroes to become CNN's Hero of the Year.
This man will get $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father return to life and return to unconsciousness, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bvelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, Cameroon's capital.
At first, his arm was broken, but the infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of itself for the rest of her life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle had accompanied his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals for years, receiving any treatment they might have received.
"It's not easy," Bwelle said.
- You can leave the house at 5:00 in the morning, run to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because of what they have to wait for.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bwellet died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor per 5,000 people.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if the Cameroonians could see a doctor, many of them could not afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of the health expenditure in the country is private.
"The only problem is poverty," Bwelle said.
"And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives."
Having seen the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Bwellé was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwellet and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
It has also established a non-profit organization, ASCOVIME, which organizes weekend trips to rural areas to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 other people are packed in vans, tied to roofs with medical supplies, and travelling across the border to visit villages in need.
They're not always lucky.
Several times they had to push cars across rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are met as real heroes: a holiday with songs and dances and the best places locals can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed an occasion for celebration, and Bwelle, with his wide smile and unlimited energy, is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the team starts receiving hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people on each trip," said Bwelle.
They come from all over the county within a radius of 60 kilometers of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these day-end clinics provides a variety of health services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can obtain crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — documents necessary for a school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the team conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in the school, municipality or house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the post-operative zone to make room for the next person.
Using the generator to light up the operating and sanitary treatment of the equipment, Bwellet and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It's too fast, but the team's commitment usually helps to keep village musicians alive.
"They beat the drums all night to keep us awake and keep working," Bwelle said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that his free hernia treatment would allow him to work again.
"This will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these weekend clinical appointments and hospital work, Surgeon Bwelle also works nights at private health clinics around Yaoundé.
It was this second job, he said, which provided 60 per cent of the funding to his non-profit organization; the rest was covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in Bwell's band.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that these campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle in his task, this is an opportunity that they would never have had at home.
"We were able to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold tools for Dr. Bwellet," said O'Malley.
As a sophomore student, you would never get that opportunity in America.
Voluntary students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often with donated medicines.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, their food, transportation, and training are paid for by Bvelle.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the almost constant workload is not a burden.
Helping others live a happy life, fulfilling their father's promise is something that brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this job," Bwelle said.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can do to help.
Snowden agreed to testify about Merkel's wiretap.
A member of the Bundestag, Hans-Cristian Schtrebele, met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the interview, the question was whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the General Prosecutor ' s Office of the Federal Republic of Germany in the case concerning the possible wiretaping of the German Chancellor ' s phone by the United States Special Court.
Snowden has expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear," said Hans-Cristian Schtrebele, "that he knows a lot.
Even though the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander, has blocked all of his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
First, however, all the conditions for his arrival must be clearly defined.
Meanwhile, American legislators are beginning to respond to the scandal surrounding U.S. spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the United States Electronic Intelligence Agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Maquis, announced this to journalists at a press conference following a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, reporting to BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkeyn relations in all fields and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the two Governments will provide assistance and support to entrepreneurs everywhere who establish direct trade and economic contacts among themselves," said Vladimir Makay.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would provide all necessary facilities and maximum cooperation.
The Minister also reported that the eighth regular meeting of the Belarus-Turkey Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had been held in Ankara, following which a protocol had been signed.
The parties have drawn up a road map for Belarusian-Turkeyn cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy office, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, economic and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture and energy, as well as seeking new forms and areas of interaction.
"The minutes of the last meeting have been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the present protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey see each other as reliable partners", he said.
Turkey ' s Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that, in the course of the negotiations, the heads of foreign policy agencies of the two countries had decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
In the Minister's view, the trade between Belarus and Turkey should be increased to $1 billion.
Turkey was also an important partner in the area of investment cooperation, which needed to be further developed, since there was an unused potential in that area, he believed.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
It will also create all the necessary conditions for trade and economic ties and for the successful work of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey", noted Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama refuses to say anything about health care.
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama turned his back yesterday on his often repeated, unequivocal promise that "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it."
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people are being notified of the cessation of services from their service providers, Republicans have in recent days criticized the President for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama made a few changes to his original public promise.
"The majority of people with health insurance that works can keep it," he said in his speech in Boston.
Regarding what he called a "resurrection on the news" about the cessation of services, Obama called on the notified Americans to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better, more comprehensive health insurance schemes at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get better terms," he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5% of the population who buy insurance themselves may have to change plans because they do not meet the new standards required under the Accessible Health Care Act.
"Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Sibelius in a speech before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the law on accessible health care, said that the Internet sale site has been "worstly bad" since October.
"I'm just as upset and angry as everyone else," she said.
"I really want your trust back."
Annoying Sibelius dropped this phrase, which was picked up by an on-line microphone sitting behind her to an assistant at yesterday's hearing in the room after a hot debate with a member of the House of Representatives, Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether she was obliged to join Obama's health programme herself.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sybelius to say why the "architect" of the Accessable Health Care Act had not voluntarily abandoned government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now imposed on millions of Americans.
Rosballt denied media status for uncensored fighting.
On 31 October, Mosgorsud decided to declare invalid the registration license of Rosball, writing "Lent".
Roscomnadzor insisted that the agency should be removed from media status for systematic and gross violations of the media law.
The trial set an unpleasant precedent: the court considered it possible to close down the media by effectively denying the publication the right to raise counter-arguments.
What's "Rosball"?
ZAO Rosballt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the years that followed, the agency opened a second headquarters office in Moscow and a number of regional offices.
The agency also has offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosballt has developed and operated as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was one of the most recognized private Internet media outlets in Russia.
However, Rosballt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications has been (and so far) written with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Discussions about the proximity of the publication to the security forces continued throughout the Agency ' s existence.
In addition to the fact that Rosballt had an extensive source base in various departments, such assumptions were supported by Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Victor Cherkesov.
However, the role of Chaplin in Rosballom's leadership is not clear: it is often referred to as "the project manager".
The director-general of the agency is Larissa Afonina, editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov.
In recent times, Rosballt has not been on federal media ratings, either by quote or by audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the "LiveInternet" rating of visits to Russian media sites.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of Rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 viewers), and the monthly average is about 3 million unique visitors.
Among the most popular material in the last five months are notes about the Kremlin's powerlessness in its relations with Ukraine, the death of a soloist of the "King and Joke" group, and pogroms in the capital Biryulev.
Rossballa's conflict with Roscomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the media law came into force, prohibiting non-censorism against journalists.
The agency discovered the prohibited language in two videos published on the agency's website ("Grigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot defiled oil towers").
The other sides are described in different ways.
Roscomnadzor, on the basis of the video found, accused Rosbalt of a gross and systematic violation of the media law and requested the court to withdraw the agency's licence.
In Rosballte, the agency's claims were said to be incorrect: first, the videos were not editorials; secondly, the mother's words were disguised in them; and thirdly, immediately after warning, the videos were removed from the site.
The Agency ' s representatives appealed against Roscomnadzor ' s claims to the Magistrate ' s Court, and when Mosgaardsud accepted the Roscomnadzor claim on 22 October 2013, these complaints were still pending.
However, on the 25th day, the justice of the peace ruled against Rosbalt: the editor-in-chief, Nikolai Ulyanov, was found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20,000 rubles - 10,000 for each commercial.
Obviously, this prejudged the outcome of the Mosgaardsud hearing - if one were to abandon the idea that the outcome might have been prejudged earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to invalidate Rosballa's registration certificate, effectively depriving the agency of its media status.
It cannot be said that Rosballt was left alone in this confrontation.
The Agency supported the deputies of the State Duma (the application to the head of Roscomnadzor, Alexander Zharov, was signed on 10 October by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the CLCF).
The Head of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Allvolod Bogdanov, the Chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Pavel Gusev, and the Head of the Presidential Human Rights Council, Michael Fedotov, have said that the closure of the publication was inappropriate.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, Roscomnadzor even gave him some assurance that the licence would not be revoked.
The Rosbalt trial showed that under whose jurisdiction it is safer for the media to be in Russia today is a big question.
Syria destroyed chemical weapons equipment
Syria destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities and recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament in Damascus was completed one day before the deadline.
By 1 November, Syria was to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities designed to prepare chemical warfare agents for use and was to transfer them to the BBC.
The destruction of the stockpiles of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, toxic substances were currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August, according to the United States.
The primary objective of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent their repair.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time, OPCW and Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be thoroughly verified by the Western Intelligence Services.
They would be willing to advise the inspectors on new sites to be inspected if there was reason to suspect that Damascus was not fully open.
The United States believes that the shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership, in accordance with an agreement brokered by Russia, destroy or render ineffective all facilities for the production of shells, gas and fluids and for the filling of shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has been reached, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons already in the possession of the Syrian army.
It is estimated that this arsenal could contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, skin-explosive mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
It requires that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities first agree on a timetable for action, which will take two weeks.
The OPCW Field Operations Manager, Jerry Smith, stated to the BBC that its inspectors had "personally observed the destruction of equipment".
"They are no longer able to produce or mix chemical weapons further," he said.
The OPCW statement stated that the inspectors had visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and had found that the projectiles and toxic substances production plants had either been destroyed or rendered unserviceable.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to be inspected, as stated in the document, but the equipment was transported from there and verified by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the destruction of the chemical weapons infrastructure was "especially difficult" because it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, there was no time to celebrate with the inspectors yet - they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that U.S. espionage "has gone awfully far"
John Kerry has shown a relaxation of U.S. surveillance tactics, making an unprecedented admission that in some cases US espionage "has gone unbelievably far."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on autopilot at the time of Edward Snowden's loud revelations about NSA spying.
These leaks put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, have actually taken some of the things that are happening on the autopilot because that possibility has already existed — both during the Second World War and during the very difficult years of the cold war, and of course on 11 September".
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that US espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases this has gone awfully far.
The President is determined to shed light on this issue and to explain himself to people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one feels abused.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted with good intentions and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We work in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow people up and attack Governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We were actually preventing plane crashing, building explosions, and killing people because we were able to learn about these plans in advance."
Meanwhile, US legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to US alleged espionage abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorist activities with the US, said the Chairman of the Senate Sub-Committee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator for Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said that he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration over the surveillance being carried out by the National Security Agency.
"In the interests of US national security, it is indeed important that Europeans remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorist efforts," said Democrat Murphy, who serves as the first-time chairman of the Senate's Sub-Committee on International Relations on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
"And I'm going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs."
News that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the U.S.
Other revelations included documents released by Snowden indicating that NSA was monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence, James Klapper, defended the espionage activities against the allies as necessary and said it was an ordinary matter on both sides.
Against the backdrop of that noise, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit by members of Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and the two chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be given in the coming days.
He said that the travel programme was still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said that some degree of "good-willed hardness" would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people about what spy programmes they themselves had used for many years.
"As we can change our tracking programmes to better protect European rights, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence activities," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry should travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address hostile issues about US policies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence activities.
In the new composition of the public monitoring commissions, the influence of prison staff will increase
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (COP) can approve new memberships of the public monitoring commissions (POCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voting option is adopted, the lobbyists will increase their influence.
CBOs are public bodies that monitor conditions in places of deprivation of liberty.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razzaev, the unrest in the Kopei colony - it is through the JNC that most of the high-profile incidents are reported behind bars.
There is a struggle between human rights defenders and the lobbyists of the Silovists to control the JNC.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the JNC, I suggested that the selection criteria should include human rights expertise.
"He wasn't accepted, and they made lists without criteria," says Valery Borschov.
Borschov is the current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, the all-Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison problems.
When he was a member of the State Duma from the Apple, he drafted a law regulating the activities of the JNC.
The OP Council should vote for the JNC in 43 regions of the country.
Fewer than a thousand applicants competed for 1,800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, competitions could not be organized owing to the absence of candidates.
OP promises to arrange for the recruitment of vacant seats.
The ONC of Moscow is one of the few competition committees, even though the new membership will have 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borschov, in the current composition of the capital commission, 11 human rights defenders and 9 Silovists, and in the OP-voting option, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to join the capital commission.
However, Vyacheslav Kalinin, a representative of the "Fraternity of War", may be re-elected.
He had been a member of the JNC for three years, but had never visited a prisoner.
Borschov believes that by appointing the Chairman of the PNC, the Sloviki will be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so that human rights defenders do not exclude a collective exit from the Commission.
In their view, the promotion of the Silovists was coordinated by a member of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, Anton Flowskov, who headed the "Russian Officers", an organization that defended the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies at night," said the RBC Daily Anton Flowers.
He denies that he lobbyes for the promotion of any lists and says that he does not intend to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opponents.
According to Flowerkov, he wasn't even interested in what list they were now voting for in the OP.
He sees Borschov's disclosure as a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Chechen ONC.
Her former leaders will be suspended because of last year's Copia riots.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the local commission ' s management had ignored prisoners ' problems.
But the RTC Rostov-on-Donu can move from human rights defenders to silovists.
From the new lists, the local commission's human rights defender was "disappeared", but one of his opponents was found to be, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber had ruled him out for unethical behaviour.
The lists of the Moscow and Rostov Commissions of Borschov consider it "a part of the Copiske".
The revelations of Hope by Toloconnikova did not affect the UCK of Mordova, which is considered to be "strong": only one human rights defender wanted to join the new team, and she did not even receive the documents for the contest.
Board member Nikolai Svanidze told RBC Daily that he had voted against the proposed list because he resented the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague Pavel Goosev says he voted in favour because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
Listing was coordinated by Deputy Secretary Vladislav Grib of the OP, who is also a member of the FISIN Research Institute.
Grib told RBC Daily that he did not believe it was right to divide candidates for human rights defenders and silovists and did not agree that the chairpersons of the commissions had sufficient powers to impede the work of its members.
The mushroom is not prepared to predict the outcome of the PLO Council vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman filing an appeal against imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for falsely claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by the Phuket Provincial Court on 15 June of filing a false suit following a Thai police report that a local taxi driver had carried out an attack on the night of Sunday, 10 June, while two other men were holding her.
However, security footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she admitted to fabricating the story.
Before the trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days ' imprisonment in the general-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuketa rather than in the women ' s adult prison.
She is the daughter of a former Australian League player, Peter Tanks, who went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "very concerned" about their daughter's well-being and waited for her to return to Australia.
"It was obviously a disturbing time, but we hope that she will return home safely as soon as possible," said Tanks.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her vacation in the Kraby spa zone in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford was currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could result in the court increasing her sentence to two years and forcing her to serve her sentence in adult prison.
However, after the recent assassination of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its damaged tourist image, leading to an acquittal.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris at the launch of his novel "Eltysheva", translated into French.
Let's remind you, this is his novel that became the finalist of four prizes: "The Clear Lane", "The Russian Booker", "The National Bestseller" and "The Big Book."
Last year, the author was awarded a cultural prize by the Government of the Russian Federation for this book.
Roman Senchin is an unmistakable leader in the current generation of 30-year-olds and 40-year-old prozacs.
Virtually every publication of its hard, modern-day stories and stories has generated a heated debate among critics from a variety of backgrounds.
It can be argued that the combined articles on prose and publicist Senchin, reviews of his books and journal publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s until the early 2010s.
In the debate about "one of the most controversial contemporary writers," it is criticized by Sergei Chuprinin that it is mostly meant by the word "literacy", as we see the present and future not only of our words, but of our lives.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow for the inclusion of most articles and reviews from the regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles tend to be reduced in the sections "Abzats..."
