Rapidly increasing cumulative coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The cumulative coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has similar trends in the EU/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, thus confirming that, despite different stages of development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units, there is a need to improve the preparedness for the influx of COVID-19 patients who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown ethos were reported in Hubei Province of China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the infection was caused by a new form of coronavirus, now known as the coronavirus of heavy acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been referred to as coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild form of disease, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, with most patients recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 is developed into a more severe condition with the need for hospitalization, and in the remaining 6% takes a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
This study analyses trends in cumulative COVID-19 in each European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) country and in the UK and compares them with trends in Hubei Province of China.
We are also comparing the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK with data for Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and in Great Britain
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and now in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving along the same dynamics as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the issue of Eurosurveillance, dated 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, which met the criteria for WHO to determine the existence of the disease.
The first three confirmed EU/EEA cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020, all three of which returned from Hubei Province of China.
As at 15 March 2020, COVID-19 had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths occurring between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750, including 1,441 fatal cases, were reported in Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative morbidity of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates at 8 a.m. daily data on the number of registered COVID-19 cases in each country of the world from official sources such as the ministries of health of these countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK and to compare them with Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence rate of active COVID-19 cases, the sequestered cumulative COVID-19 incidence was calculated for 14 days, taking into account the normal COVID-19 current in each EU/EEA country and in the UK for the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We have also submitted a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8 a.m. on 15 March 2020, compared with Italy ' s data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and in Great Britain
The trends in cumulative co-incidence of COVID-19 over a 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK as a whole were consistent with those observed in Hubei Province of China (figure 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom as a whole began to increase on or around 21 February, and on 28 February 2020, this indicator was sharply accelerated (additional material).
This was due mainly to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU/EEA countries and in the UK there were similar trends in cumulative COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded at 8 a.m. on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about three weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of registered COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK.
The observed cumulative trends in COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite different stages in different countries, different responses by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for recognition of cases and different rules for patient selection for COVID-19 testing, including "verification" testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions were already fully filled.
To date, only 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases are available from COVID-19 to hospitals and (or) intensive care units in the EU/EEA (not available).
However, such data should be systematically collected to supplement current surveillance data on the number of reported cases and deaths.
According to a study conducted between 2010 and 2011, there is a significant disparity in the number of beds in intensive care and intensive care units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010 - 2011).
The 6th update report of the ESCC on the results of the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment presents scenarios of the load load of health systems with estimates of hospitalization of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of lack of affordable beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.
As the cases are currently grouped into certain EU/EEA and British regions, and hospitals and intensive care units tend to serve the population of a certain territorial group, it is recommended that information on infections and beds in intensive care units be provided, where possible, at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the long-term SARS-CoV-2 contact scenario and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as can be seen in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and integrated approach is essential to contain the spread of SARS-COV-2 and then move from containment to minimization, since, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to reflect, adopt and adjust their response if such measures are not taken in advance.
The rapid risk assessment report also listed public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can intensify their monitoring efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks health systems in other EU/EEA countries will be faced with an influx of patients who will need intensive treatment.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 (SARS-COV-2), has become a tragedy for mankind: more than 3,000 people have now died in China and elsewhere in the world and more than 80,000 people have been infected.
Like the homologic SARS-Cov virus, which caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-COV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less serious than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older persons than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving subject matter of the study.
We will look at the basic aspects of epidemiology, etyology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction of the future current and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions have yet to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate a dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), which fell on 25 January 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and for many weeks after the outbreak of the new virus infection.
In view of the high degree of coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 named the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the associated coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout the country and then to almost 50 other countries around the world.
As at 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been identified, more than 40,000 patients had recovered, and more than 3,000 patients had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "a number one enemy to society" and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 were published in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etyology, diagnostics and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus from a number of patients.
The review is an attempt to synthesize research findings in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus-induced disease, the coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), whose outbreak occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss known facts about the prevention and prediction of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
The coronavirus has traditionally been one of pathogens that are not lethal to humans and that mainly cause about 15% of general respiratory diseases.
However, in this century, we have faced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses of man, namely the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov-2) and the coronavirus of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV), which caused an outbreak of diseases initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other States with a horrific level of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the first reported cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported to the National Health Commission of the PRC from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatality was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that medical personnel were infected, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted from humans to humans.
On 23 January, a quarantine was introduced in Wuhan city, and public transport in the city was cut off.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of the disease, 21 of the 41 patients with a confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered as the starting point for the spread of infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of coronavirus was a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (figure 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scope and risk of the outbreak have yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with COVID-19 confirmed, provided the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-Cov2 has been affected by all age groups, but mainly by people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
The infection of SARS-Cov2 is higher among men (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has been distributed in clusters mainly in Hubei province and in the surrounding regions.
On average, from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to the diagnosis, 5 days (2-9) were spent.
The incubation period averaged 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
From the onset of the symptoms to the onset of death, an average of 9.5 days (4.8–13) took place.
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95 % CI: 3.51 - 4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 - 4.82.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons, which coincided with large transport traffic on the eve of the celebration of the Chinese New Year.
The mortality rate for patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95 % CI: 1.10 - 1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate for patients was 3.06% (95 % CI: 2.02 - 4.49%).
The three main risk factors in the case of COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronavirus is a subfamily of large shell viruses containing a single line of RNA.
They can be divided into four species, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta coronavirus are known to affect humans.
In the case of coronavirus types SARS and MERs, glycorotein of the pulmonary spines (S) is connected to the cell receptors of type 2 angiotensin-preversion enzyme (ACE2) and dipptidylpeptidas 4 (DPP4) respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
The cytoplasm is released by the viral RNA genome; after replicating the viral genome, the genomic RNA, together with the shell glycoroteins and proteins of nucleocapsis, generates vesicular vesiculars, which then merge with the cell membrane, releasing the virus.
The first genomic sequence reports of SARS-CoV-2 were released on January 10, 2020.
SARS-Cov2 is found to be a new type of beta coronavirus, the genome of which is 99.98% consistent with the 10 consecutive samples collected at the first outbreak point in Juanan in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-Cov-2 is closer to SARS-Cov than MERS-COV.
SARS-Cov2 particles were detected in ultra-sensive slits of human respiratory epithelials by means of an elucidating electroscopic microscope.
The ACE2 human enzyme is found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as for SARS-Cov.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the ACE2 enzyme of a person weaker than that of SARS-Cov, which explains the fact that SARS-Cov2 causes patients a less serious condition than SARS-Cov.
SARS-Cov2 can also produce previously unknown short-lived protein, encoded orf3b, and secret protein, encoded orf8.
The squirrel orf3b of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can play a role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress the expression IFNβ; however, the orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a group of authors led by Zhou (Zhou) submitted reports on the cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full enzyme ACE2 with a resolution of 2.9 in the complex with the Amino Acid Transporter B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed modifications, was collected as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could connect two S-proteins, which is proof of the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for a drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate master
It is known that both SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov were bats from which the virus was transmitted to man via cyvette and camels respectively.
By means of a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-Cov2 with other coronavirus, it was found that the first owners of SARS-Cov2 were bats, since the new 96% virus was identical to the SARS coronavirus, namely the coronavirus of the bats SL-CovZX45 and SL-CovZX21.
However, it remains unknown what kind of intermediate host the virus has been able to break the species barrier and infect the human being; the transmission route also remains to be determined.
Mr. Ji (Ji) suggested with colleagues that the vectors of the virus from bats to man were snakes, during which a homological recombination took place in S-protein.
According to their research, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou have suggested that pangolins, long-gear mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic similarity between the coronavirus of pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1 per cent difference between the two genomes is still very large, so it is believed that the final results with specific evidence are not yet available (figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-COV-2 are still largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-Cov and MERS-COV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and between 40 and 50 per cent humidity.
SARS-COV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heating up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; esters, 75% ethyl alcohols, chlorine disinfectants, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidin, can effectively block the activity of the virus.
The human population as a whole does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to a new virus.
At present, there are no detailed studies of the SARS-CoV-2 immune response.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronavirus, primarily SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov (figure 4.4).
As a rule, the virus that entered the host's body first recognizes the innate immune system through image recognition receptors (ORRs), including the receptors of the C-type receptor, the Toll-like receptors, the NOD-like receptors and the RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammation factors, the ripening of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which deter the spread of the virus and accelerate the pagocytosis of macrophages for viral antigens.
However, the N-squirrel SARS-Cov can avoid immune reactions.
Soon, an adaptive immune response will be included in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
The CD4+ T-cells encourage the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and the CD8+ T-cells directly kill the virus-affected cells.
T-Helper produces anti-inflammatory cytokins that help protect the cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T-cell functions by causing their programmed death.
Human immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovering patient neutralized MERS-Cov.
On the other hand, the hyper-reaction of the immune system results in the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which could cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst-case scenario could lead to multi-organ failure and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by a cluster infection, is more likely to affect older persons with associated pathologies and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have immune system disorders.
According to a study of the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-Cov2 is between 1 and 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed an average incubation period of 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
More recently, a study based on the demographics of 8,866 cases described above showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2 days).
It is very important for the health authorities to adjust the time frame for quarantine measures to take into account the best estimates of the length of the incubation period, thus preventing the spread of the virus to those infected with an unimptifiable disease.
It has become common practice to have a 14-day quarantine for persons who have had contact with the virus or are infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and primary symptom of COVID-19 is often a high temperature, which can be the only manifestation or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, respiratory difficulties, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, cold, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced respiratory and (or) hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperature and/or symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis, even in the absence of pathologies in thorax images.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following symptoms: 98% high temperature, 76% dry cough, 55% breathing and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed artificial lung ventilation.
Similar results have been obtained from two recent studies of domestic infections and transmission of the virus from unimptomized infected persons.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-Cov, whose main symptoms were also high temperatures (98 per cent), dry cough (47 per cent) and breathing (55 per cent).
However, 80% of them required artificial lung ventilation, a much higher rate than COVID-19 patients, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhea (26%) and throatache (21%).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high temperatures (99–100 per cent), dry cough (29–75 per cent), breathing (40–42 per cent), diarrhoea (20–25 per cent) and throatache (13–25 per cent), while artificial lung ventilation is required from 14–20 per cent of patients.
As at 14 February, COVID-19 had a mortality rate of 2 per cent, and the total number of confirmed cases in the world had reached 66,576.
In comparison, SARS deaths by November 2002 were 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
According to an earlier study, the baseline reproduction (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was set at 6.47 with 95% confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.73, while R0 for SARS-Cov was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-Cov2 with MERS-Cov and SARA-Cov by symptom, mortality and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.
The above indicators show a higher prevalence potential for SARS-Cov2 than for MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov, but the mortality rate for new infections is lower than for the last two.
Thus, the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic will be much more difficult to contain than the MERS-Cov and SARS-COV epidemics.
Clusters often occur when infected within a family or group of people who have gathered together for any reason or have been together on any transport, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often travelled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there or had contact with infected persons or patients during the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people can be infected with the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and treated patients who have been released from hospital can become infected again, and this is a wake-up call to extend the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have normal or reduced leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19s had leukocytes < 4×109/L, including leukocytes < 1×109/L, as well as elevated levels of asparagin-amino transpherasis and virus.
High levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were detected in some patients ' blood, and high levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocytes were observed in most patients.
In patients with severe illness, the D-dimer level, the fabric decay product present in the bloodstream has been increased and the number of lymphocytes has been constantly decreasing.
For most patients with COVID-19, thorax X-rays revealed pathologies characterized by uneven blackouts on both sides or darkenings of the "maternal glass" type in the lungs.
Patients often develop SARS, acute pulmonary damage and acute respiratory disease.
Uncontrolled inflammation, build-up of liquid and progressive fibrosis result in a significant disruption of the exchange of gas during the development of the ERI.
Disability of type I and II pneumonia reduces surface-activated compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung decline.
Thus, the worst X-ray results often coincide with the worst cases.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocyte separation, the formation of hyalin membranes and inter-channel lymphocytic infiltration, and multi-nuclear synctal cells in lung patients who died of the disease are consistent with the pathologies of viral infection and ORI and similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The primary criterion used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 was the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA by means of a polymeric chain reaction with a reverse transcription (PCR with a reverse transcription).
However, given the high level of false negative results, which could accelerate the epidemic ' s development, since 13 February 2020, China has begun to diagnose itself on the basis of clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on reverse transcription of the PCR).
The same was true of SARS diagnostics.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine the disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray results.
On 14 February 2020, a team of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang described a protocol for the application of SHERLOCK, based on a repeat of CRISPR, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which allows the detection of synthetic RNA fragments SARS-CoV-2 at a density of 20 × 10–18 mol/l to 200 × 10–18 mol/L (10–100 copies per microlitre of the original sample) by means of indicator strips in less than an hour without using sophisticated equipment.
This new method, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity and comfort of the tests.
Due to the lack of experience with the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mainly provide patients with COVID-19 only with supportive therapy while at the same time attempting to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or suggested in the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, as well as other viral diseases (table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antivirals, immunity inhibitors, steroids, recovery plasma, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even the plasma of recovering patients should be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the initial stages, SARS-Cov-2 attacks mainly the lungs and may also be less likely to affect other ACE2 agents, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
Nevertheless, the disruption of work and the failure of breathing organs are the main threats and causes of death.
Therefore, support for the respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, which are assigned according to the severity of the disease, is critical to alleviating the symptoms and saving lives.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxidation (ECOM), a modified extrapulmonary circulatory treatment for life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of the water-salin balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as the protection of vital organ functions, are essential for patients with SARS-COV-2.
The cytokin storm is known to be a consequence of the hyper-reaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS.
The cytocin storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process developed in response to the selection of a series of cytokins, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN and MCP-1.
These cytokins cause immunocytes to release a huge amount of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of ARI and polyorganic insufficiency.
In the treatment of cytokin storm, especially in patients in difficult condition, the suppression of immunity is essential.
Corticostesters and tocilysumab, monoclonal antibodies serving as interleitin-6 inhibitor, were used to treat cytokin storm.
Other methods of treating cytokin storm based on the suppression of immunity include a module of immune response aimed at monitoring T-cells; a blockade of the production of cytokins IFN-IL-1 and TNF; suppression of Janus-kinase; the use of pantatumomab, cytokin signal superpressors 4 and hisstondeacetalase inhibitors.
steroids are widely used to reduce the severity of the effects of inflammation in the treatment of SARS viruses.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful in treating severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially awascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.
However, short courses for corticostesters in small and medium doses are recommended for application with caution in the critical treatment of patients with COVID-19.
At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.
However, the introduction of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogy, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and the Marburg virus.
Later, the remdesivir also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with single-chain RNA, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these data, Gilead has provided this drug supply to China to conduct joint research on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are looking forward to it.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavire/ritonavire and Ribavirin were offered as possible options for treating patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination treatment with epipinavire/ritonavire can be accompanied by diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
Care should be taken to monitor the interaction of these drugs with other medications assigned to patients.
Plasma of recovering patients and antibodies
Blood collection from patients treated for infectious disease has been used for a long time to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect a healthy population.
Indeed, the blood of recovering patients often contains relatively high amounts of antibodies to control the pathogen.
Antibodies are found in an immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to control pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogens molecules and target them.
On the basis of this premise, plasma was extracted from blood samples of a group of patients treated with COVID-19, which was then injected into 10 severely ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the inflammation rate and viral load decreased, as well as increased oxygen stabbing.
However, in order to propose mass use of this method prior to specific treatment, it is necessary to have not yet been tested or explained.
In addition, in view of the therapeutic effects, some of the shortcomings associated with the use of plasma should be carefully examined.
Antibodies, for example, can over-incentive the immune system and cause cytokin release syndrome, which, given the toxicity, is a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma is required to treat patients in critical condition.
It is not easy to design and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to single out the V cells of recovering patients and determine the genetic code of effective antibodies or to screen to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
That way we can move immediately to mass production of antibodies.
For thousands of years, Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on a combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which varies according to the diagnosis of a disease based on Chinese traditional medicine theories.
Most effective components are still unknown or uncertain because it is difficult to single out and verify these components or their optimal combination.
At present, because of the lack of effective specific treatment for COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild and moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of illness.
For example, Su Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest rate of recovery from COVID-19 occurred in a number of provinces in China, where 87 per cent of patients were treated with Chinese traditional medicine, including in Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ninxia (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in Hubei province, where only about 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 were treated with Chinese traditional medicine, the lowest rate of recovery (13 per cent) was recorded.
However, this is a rather rough comparison, since the assessment should take into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Chang) and his colleagues published a study comparing the treatment exclusively by Western medicine and combined treatment by Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the time frame for the normalization of body temperature, the elimination of symptoms and the provision of in-patient medical care had been significantly lower for patients whose treatment had been combined with Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients who had been treated only by Western methods.
Most strikingly, the proportion of patients who began to suffer from symptoms (from light to heavy) was markedly lower in the group treated through a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only by Western methods (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second group (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still require more closely monitored research, carried out on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of interest to receive, if possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine or its combination.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 are mainly very afraid of acutely contagious and even deadly diseases, and people who are quarantined are also bored, lonely and extremely irritating.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticoids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the outbreak of the SARS virus, a number of psychiatric diseases were reported, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, deliria and even suicidal behaviour.
Mandatory contact monitoring and quarantine, among the measures taken by the health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons under suspicion and in contact with them, as well as to all other persons who need it.
As part of psychological support, multidisciplinary mental health teams should be established, accurate information should be provided with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-COV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the transmission chain from animal vectors and infected people to susceptible owners and are often used in addition to the antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
S-protein-based vaccines have been developed to produce long-lived and highly active antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-Cov.
In animal research, live weakened vaccines for SARS viruses were developed.
However, before clinical studies begin, it is still necessary to determine the impact of these possible vaccines in the natural environment for use by age patients, the model of lethal infections and the degree of protection against the infection of zoonoses.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since then.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of disease caused by the MERS virus continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions as a result of the conservation of zoonosis sources in endemic habitats.
To combat MERS, strategies have been developed for vaccination using an activated virus, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and elements of recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been evaluated for animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-COV-2 vaccine for persons without immunity is an urgent and critical task that needs to be addressed in order to contain the devastating epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long period (on average 18 months) required for vaccine development and the dynamic modification of coronavirus.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical current of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe illness.
It is therefore critical for health authorities to develop a prognosis model to prioritize their interventions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on the clinical evidence provided to date, the following factors may influence or be linked to the prediction of the disease in patients with COVID-19 (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the flow of the SARS virus, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between 30 and 65 years of age, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study 8,866 cases.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have basic illnesses and complications and were much older than those who did not need such treatment (on average 66 years compared to 51 years), which suggests that age is a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: The infection of SARS-Cov2 is higher among men than among women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Diseases and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop severe damage to myocardia and arrhythmia.
Cardiological events were also the leading cause of death of SARS patients.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also communicate with ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which could cause liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely related and can distort results.
Deviations identified in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in blood reflects the severity of the inflammation process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential predictive of the current of the disease, the reaction to therapy and the final recovery.
It was also suggested that consideration should be given to the relationship between the C-reactive protein level, the severity of the disease and the COVID-19 projection.
In addition, higher levels of lactatdehydrogenase, asparagine amino transphrazes, alanin amino transphrazes and creatininase can also predict results.
These enzymes are given in large quantities by different organs, especially heart and liver, and their release occurs when the tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers for cardiac or liver failure.
Main clinical symptoms: In order to predict results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, thorax X-ray data and clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account, among other factors.
The use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunity suppressors widely used in infectious diseases as complementary therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammation process.
Since corticostesters were widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many survivors developed avoscular osteonecrosis, which led to life-long disabilities and poor quality of life.
Thus, if steroids are to be used to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be given in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with high levels of uncertainty and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
In order to relieve the stress of such patients and help them to return to normal life, psychological counselling and long-term support must be provided.
According to demographic studies to date, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tracts, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronavirus causing common cold diseases, can reproduce successfully in the upper respiratory tracts and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms at all at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, those patients who have an early stage of the disease or who have not yet completed the incubation period can spread the virus on a large scale in their normal lives, which makes epidemiological surveillance very difficult.
However, it was believed that the SARS-Cov virus was transmitted when patients were seriously ill, but most of the cases did not occur at an early stage of the infection.
Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control.
China is currently working hard to establish a universal quarantine in Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as to extend the quarantine regime for almost the entire population in order to break the SARS-CoV-2 virus chain.
While these measures are detrimental to the economy and other areas of the country ' s life, the number of new patients identified is decreasing, indicating a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March, and the blackout phase will last three to four months.
However, some experts are less optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter with colleagues estimated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looked much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from a group led by Ira Longini developed a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two thirds of the world's population.
A team of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been detected in nose and throat swabs taken from patients who had recovered and been discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to influenza.
However, the decrease in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, pointing out that the strategies currently in place may have had an impact.
Initial projections suggest that Ebola fever would hit up to a million people and cause half a million deaths.
But by means of strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
There is a possibility that, like the SARS-Cov virus, the infection potential of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may weaken, and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of cough or sneezing as well as, possibly, direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the cauldron, which means that oral-fecal transmission is also possible.
According to a recent study, 41 per cent of the 138 cases studied may have resulted from infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even others who are in contact with patients or infected.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of facial masks; and surgical masks, and class N95 respirators (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not allow fluids from potentially infected people to fly into the air and settle on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (series No. 1860s) can protect virions of 10 to 80 nm from inhalation, only 5% of virios are missing, SARS-Cov-2 is of the same size as SARS-Cov, and they are both approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can even penetrate five surgical masks together, medical personnel who are in direct contact with patients must wear N95 masks (series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health workers should wear a figure-shaped protective robe to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore a class N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflammated eyes.
Medical personnel should therefore also wear transparent face boards or closed-type protective glasses.
It is strongly recommended that all populations in affected or potentially threatened regions should more often wash their hands with disinfectant detergents, try not to leave home in isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is about a metre.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-Cov2 virus had not previously been known to mankind, its high degree of similarity to SARS-Cov, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have been a wake-up call for China, taking into account the experience it had gained during the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, it was only after 19 January 2020 that the director of the Centre for Disease Control in Ouhan calmed the population, reporting that the new virus had low contagia and limited reproductive capacity in human-to-human transmission and that prevention and control of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement significantly reduced social tensions, particularly at a time when the entire country was preparing for the celebration of the Chinese New Year, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be contained within Wuhan with minimal losses.
China ' s health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since every word is taken into account by citizens and may affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger measures to contain the potential epidemic at the early stages of its development rather than to reassure the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly test and improve the public response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the previously unexplored coronavirus of heavy acute second-type respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2), began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease had spread throughout China and had spread to 50 countries around the world at the time of writing.
Because the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19 symptoms are similar to the symptoms of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the outbreak of COVID-19 gave rise to a feeling of a relapse of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS in terms of controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older persons more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of serious cases and mortality among older persons is also higher than among young people.
The mortality rate for SARS is higher than for COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is unimptomated, while SARS patients usually infect others only in severe cases of disease, so it is more difficult to contain COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-Cov2 is spreading much faster and bigger than SARS-Cov.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative regular samples for SARS-COV-2.
On the other hand, cured patients can re-sample positive samples for the virus.
All of this significantly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
With this rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some critical issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-COV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 per cent homologist between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronavirus, we still can't claim that SARS-COV-2 was infected by bats.
What animal has become an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to man?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely interrupt the transmission path, and the epidemiological situation can worsen at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is connected to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus inject into respiratory cells and cause further pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve in human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause a global pandemic, will it disappear like SARS, or will it periodically repeat like flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Zoonous origin of human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated coernavirus (CoV) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronavirus (HCOV) causes a mild disease, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus can be.
The appearance of the severe acute second-type respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 brought attention to the coronavirus again and surprised us with a high transmission, but a weaker pathogenicity of the virus than that of the SARS-Cov virus.
The coronavirus infection is zoonosis, and understanding its zoonosis will be very useful.
Most human coronavirus comes from bats for which they are not pathogenic.
There are also known intermediate carrier tanks for some human coronavirus.
The definition of animal carriers has a direct impact on the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of animals carrying coronavirus can also shed light on coronavirus pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we present available data on seven human coronavirus, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoonosis and inter-species transmission.
It is important to note that we compare and compare different human coronavirus in terms of viral evolution and genome recombination.
In this context, today ' s epidemic of coronavirus disease discovered in 2019 (COVID-19) is also being considered.
In addition, the conditions required for successful change of vectors and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the current of the disease are noted.
The coronavirus is part of the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar thread of RNA.
These viruses, with the largest RNA virus containing a genome of between 26 and 32,000 nucleotides, were named because of their form, which, when considered under an electronic microscope, resembles the crown.
In terms of structure, coronavirus contains unsegmented genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two large open, partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are broadcast into polyproteins of replications pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, referred to as nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains open-reading frames for structured proteins, including chopoid protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other coronavirus lines also encoded a number of lynia-specific accessor proteins.
Based on differences in protein/coronavirus sequences, the species is divided into four species (alpha, beta, gamma and deltacoronavirus), and the species of beta coronavirus includes most human coronavirus and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogetic evidence that most alpha- and beta-coronavirus are genetically produced by bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and deltacoronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronavirus has constantly overcome inter-species barriers, and some have evolved to dangerous pathogens.
To date, seven human coronavirus have been known.
These include human alpha-coronavirus HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63.
The remaining five beta coronaviruses include HCov-OC43, HCov-HKU1, the coronavirus of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) and the coronavirus of the severe acute respiratory syndrome of the second type SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronavirus HCov-229E, HCov-OC43, HCov-HKU1 and HCov-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as cold and (or) diarrhoea.
By contrast, SARS-Cov, MERS-Cov and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher probability of acute respiratory disease (ORD) and external symptoms.
The first thread of the human coronavirus HCOV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample of patients separated from the sock of patients who had colds in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has generated more detailed knowledge of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 viruses, which cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronavirus was generally considered harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in the current history; more than 8,000 people were ill and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, discovered in 2019, is the cause of the current coronavirus epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which, as at 3 March 2020, had claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.
The alarm has been received, and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses are of zoonosy origin and are derived from bats, mice, or pets.
Numerous data sets show in favour of the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronavirus from bats to which viruses have been well adapted and in which no pathogenic properties are present, but where there is wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has left China and the world with a severe medical, scientific, social and moral challenge.
A study of the zoonosic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will make it possible to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting interspecies transport.
It may also indicate or accelerate the search for a reservoir, an intermediate and amplification carrier, SARS-COV-2, which is essential to prevent a recurrence of the disease in the future.
This overview provides general information on the zoonosis, inter-species transmission and pathogenesis of human coronavirus.
In particular, we identify and consider the following common characteristic: the original viruses that have caused human coronavirus are usually not pathogenic to their storage media, but they become pathogenic after inter-species transmission to the new host.
We are also analysing the evolution of human coronavirus, where increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also being considered.
Animal coronavirus has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of the HCOV-229E virus was first derived from a sample of patients with colds separated from their noses, various coronavirus were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronavirus have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 provides an informative and illustrative summary of the history of human coronavirus detection in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCov-229E virus was derived from samples taken from the respiratory tracts of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, and later adapted to reproduction in the WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E showed cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, general malaise and throat pain, while high temperatures and cough were observed in between 10 and 20 per cent of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCov-OC43 virus was separated from the organ culture and later a serial pass into the brain of the sucker mice.
Clinical signs of HCov-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCOV-229E, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from those of other pathogens, such as Type A influenza and Rinovirus.
Both the HCOV-229E virus and the HCOV-OC43 virus are widespread in the world and are generally transmitted during winter in moderate latitudes.
Most of the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of disease.
According to a volunteer study, healthy people infected with the HCOV-229E virus developed a common mild cold.
Only a few patients with reduced immunity showed severe lower respiratory infections.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the "Atypical Pneumonia epidemic", was the first well-documented pandemic in human coronavirus in human history, and the disease was caused by the SARS-CoV virus, the third known human coronavirus.
The first SARS case was detected at the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread across many countries and continents.
With the exception of superactive proliferators, it was estimated that each person could infect approximately two more persons; the incubation period ranged from 4 to 7 days, and the peak of the virus load occurred on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-Cov were initially suffering from muscle pains, headaches, high temperatures, general illness and chills, and later symptoms included breathing, coughing, and respiratory failure.
The common laboratory deviations from the SARS standard are lymphopia, liver disorders and elevated levels of creattinase.
Patients with SARS also experience diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophagic levels.
Approximately 20-30 percent of patients subsequently require intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation of their lungs.
In such severe cases, in addition to lower respiratory tracts, other organs may also be infected, including those of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, usually accompanied by cytokin storm, which may be lethal, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy by a patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a great deal of effort has been devoted to research on human coronavirus.
At the end of 2004, HCov-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was found that it mainly affected young children, the elderly and patients with reduced immunity and respiratory diseases.
HCov-NL63 is characterized by cold, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolite.
Another independent study described the separation of the same virus from the nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy in the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was detected in the Netherlands, but in fact it is widespread.
HCov-NL63 is estimated to be the cause of approximately 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases and its peak occurs at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is linked to an obstruction laryngitis, also known as a croup.
HCov-HKU1 was singled out in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old male hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitus.
In addition to out-of-school pneumonia and bronchiolitus, HCov-HKU1 is associated with an increase in asthmatic diseases.
Like HCov-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, the HCov-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory diseases, has been detected worldwide.
All of these four human coronavirus causing non-hospital infections have been well adapted to humans, and their mutation, which causes highly pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although incidents and their causes are unknown, as in the rare example of the more virulent HCoV-NL63 subtype, which, according to recent reports, has caused serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Usually, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic when they acquire the ability to transmit effectively and remain in the human body.
The coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first separated in Saudi Arabia in 2012 from a mild 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Most of the laboratory confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia there were cases of flooding and distribution through occasional secondary cases of infection in close contact.
Another secondary outbreak, with 186 confirmed cases, occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) are similar to the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), both of which are characterized by advanced acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERs from other diseases caused by coronavirus transmissions to humans.
More than 30 per cent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases of high-mortality Middle East respiratory syndrome (34.4%) were reported, so MERS-Cov is considered one of the most deadly viruses known to humans.
In Hubei Province of China, Wuhan, between mid-December 2019 and the end of December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients were identified and are now associated with a coronavirus-induced severe acute respiratory syndrome of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the past.
The World Health Organization has announced that the continuing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself is called "coronavirus 19" (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with approximately 3.4 per cent of deaths.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in Hubei Province of China is 4.2 per cent and 1.2 per cent outside.
SARS-Cov2, like SARS and MERS coronavirus, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by increased temperature, cough and breathing.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly transition to acute respiratory failure.
Despite the similarities between SARS-Cov and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82 per cent), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-COV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater transfer capability than SARS-Cov and MERS-COV.
There have been cases of non-immptom infections of SARS-CoV-2, which indicate that the virus can spread rapidly around the world.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-Cov2 with the other six human coronavirus reveals important similarities and differences.
First, coronavirus transmissions have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease they cause.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronavirus.
Second, in terms of severity, COVID-19 symptoms are located between SARS-CoV and four human coronavirus causing non-hospital infections (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those most common in human coronavirus infections causing non-hospital infections, including non-specific manifestations, slight symptoms or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as in the case of SARS-Cov infection, a small sub-group of severe COVID-19 cases can be distinguished, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also has interesting patterns, both for human coronavirus causing non-hospital infections and for SARS-Cov.
On the one hand, the transfer of SARS-COV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronavirus, which causes non-hospital infections.
On the other hand, it has yet to be verified whether the transmission of SARS-Cov2 is decreasing with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. each person infected), as in the cases of SARS-Cov and MERS-COV.
Finally, like other human coronavirus causing out-of-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in cala samples.
We have yet to answer the question as to whether the physical-oral transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is as relevant (at least under certain circumstances) as SARS-Cov.
Of particular interest is the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2 in human coronavirus causing non-hospital infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenicity and sustainable distribution after transition.
All four human coronavirus, causing out-of-hospital infections with mild symptoms, have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, they may have adapted well to these four human coronavirus.
In other words, both could be described as the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human coronavirus, which causes severe diseases in humans, and people whose human coronavirus causes severe diseases, have simply not survived.
For this to happen, human coronavirus must be replicated in the human body sufficiently to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract the limitations of the host.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the more likely it is that the virus is fully adapted to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infectious disease control activities.
For many years, four out-of-hospital coronavirus have been circulating among the population, causing normal colds in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses don't need an animal reserve.
High pathogenic coronavirus SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov have not adapted well enough to humans and their transmission to humans cannot be sustained.
They need to preserve and reproduce in their zoonoses and seek to reach sensitive human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or reinforcing carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-Cov/MERS-Cov and four off-site HCov viruses.
It's very easy to transmit like out-of-hospital HCovs, at least for the time being.
But it's more pathogenic than out-of-school HCovs and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-Cov.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to human beings and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCov viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, reinforcing and containerized HCOV viruses.
The animal serves as an evolutionary host of HCov if it carries a near-born ancestor with the same high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestor virus is usually well adapted and not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the reserve carrier has been carrying HCov continuously for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCov or its parent virus.
By contrast, if HCov was only carried in an intermediate medium just before or about the time it was carried by a human being, it was not well adapted to the new host and was often pathogenic.
This intermediate medium can serve as a zoonosis source of human infection and act as an reinforcing medium, allowing the virus to replicate lightningly and then pass it on to people, increasing the extent of human contamination.
HCoV can withstand a dead end infection if it cannot withstand transmission within the intermediate carrier.
On the contrary, HCov viruses can also adapt to the intermediate medium and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural container carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that patient zero SARS had contact with hunting animals (deceased animals) in anamnesia.
Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that animal traffickers have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-Cov virus than the general population.
The Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and the raccoid dog in the living animal markets became the first known carriers of viruses such as and almost identical to SARS-Cov.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all the civets in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that in most cases, SARS-CoV had not been identified in the Himalayan civets, either in nature or on farms, but had not been marketed, which led to the conclusion that the Himalayan civets could only serve as an intermediate booster, rather than as a natural SARS-Cov.
Significantly, since 80 per cent of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-Cov, it cannot be ruled out that multiple species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate reinforcements.
They all seem to be dead end carriers of the SARS-Cov virus.
A subsequent search for a natural animal carrier, SARS-Cov, revealed a close-born CoV of bats, which was described as associated with the atypical pneumonia coronavirus of HKU3 bats (SARSr-Rh-BatCov HKU3), and which is present in Chinese bats.
These mice are positive on the antibodies to SARS-Cov and the genomic sequence SARSr-Rh-BatCov HKU3.
These and other coronavirus bats have 88-92% of the same homologic nucleotide sequences as SARS-Cov.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats have become carriers of new human pathogens.
The bats also identified several SARS-like coronavirus (SL-Cov), but none of them, except one, which designates WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
The SARS-Cov receptor is known to be the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, derived from a sample of bat feces, uses ACE2 bats, cyvettes, and man as a receptor for entering the cage.
Curiously, the serums of recovery patients from SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor SARS-Cov in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homologue between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus SARS-Cov, and that bats are not the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-Cov.
The Physological Analysis assigns MERS-Cov to the same group as the CV-HKU4 bats and the CV-HKU5 bats.
COV-HKU4 bats and MERS-COV use the same host receptor, dippetyl dipeptidasis-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The sequence of RNA-dependent MERS-CoV polymerase virus is phylogeneically closer to the sequences of beta-coronavirus bats detected in Europe and Africa.
So far, wild bats have never found a live MERS-Cov virus.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences MERS-Cov and his closest relative, CoV-HKU25 bats only corresponds to 87%.
So bats may not be the direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-Cov virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single camels are sero-positive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-Cov, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
The live MERS-Cov, identical to the virus found in humans, was extracted from the nasal swabs of a single camel, further confirming the role of camels as the true MERS-COV container carriers.
It is also worth noting that camels that are experimentally infected with MERS-CoV showed slight symptoms, but massive viruses.
It is noteworthy that infected camels not only excreted the virus by respiratory means, but also by fecal oral route, which is also the main route of virus separation in bats.
However, there are still questions as many confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome did not have any contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms and are reasonably attributable to human transmission or transmission by unknown channels, including unidentified species of animals carrying MERS-COV.
The nucleotides of SARS-Cov2 are 96.2% consistent with the CoV RaTG13 bats of Asian pods Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to be attributed to parental relationships.
So bats may not be the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical bat coronavirus is found in the future.
It is believed that the immediate animal carriers of the SARS-COV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are being sold and killed in the Wuhan wholesale market for seafood, which was associated with many initial cases of COVID-19, indicating a likely case of transmission from an animal to an animal.
Several recent metagenomic sequence studies have concluded that a group of threatened small mammals known as Pangolina (Manis javanica) could also carry a parent beta-coronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The homology of nucleotides sequences of these new coronavirus pangolirus genomes is 85-92 percent consistent with SARS-Cov-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with an identity at the nucleotide sequence level of about 90%.
They are clustered into two sub-lines of virus differentiation, such as SARS-CoV-2, in a phylognetic tree, one of which has a receptor-linking domain (PCD) closer to SARS-COV-2 with an identical amino acid sequence of 97.4%.
On the contrary, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains are more disvergent, despite the higher degree of gomology of sequences in the entire genome.
An earlier study of Pangolin patients also reported the identification of viral contigos in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-Cov-2.
The study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to produce a genome sequence of about 86.3 per cent of the full-size viral genome.
It cannot be ruled out that Pangolin has become one of the intermediate delivery agents of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-Cov-2 from pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-Cov2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus pangolins associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution path SARS-Cov-2 has not yet been established in bats, pangolins and other mammals.
While the highest sequence homology was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus pangolins related to SARS-Cov-2, SARS-Cov-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence homology in the entire genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of resemblance between beta-coronavirus pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is linked to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal favours recombination between the beta coronavirus of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the immediate zoonosis of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCov viruses, the zoonosis origin of HCov-229E, HCov-OC43, HCov-NL63 and HCov-HKU1 viruses is also being studied.
The philogenetic evidence shows that both HCov-NL63 and HCOV-229E can occur from the coronavirus of bats, while the parent viruses of HCov-OC43 and HCov-HKU1 are found in rodents.
It has been reported that the coronavirus of bats, called ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and identified in a North American tri-colored moat, has a close relationship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E is genetically linked to another coronavirus of bats called Hypposideros/GanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although it was suspected that its intermediate host might have been camels.
For the sake of clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronavirus is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
The physical analysis provided evidence of inter-species HCov transmissions in anamnesia.
When the HCov-OC43 virus was inter-speciesized around 1890 and people were infected by domestic animals, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of the inter-species HCOV-229E transmission is not so clear.
Alpha-coronavirus bats were detected, close to the HCOV-229E.
There's an alpha-coronavirus of alpaca between them.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was people, not alpacas, who could have been in contact with bats in a common environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacas.
Second, the alpha-coronavirus of bats related to HCOV-229E in bats is diverse and unpathogenic, while the Alpaca alpha-coronavirus has caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, Alpaca's alpha coronavirus was not found in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas have received an alpha-coronavirus related to HCOV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of pathogenic human viruses, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipach virus and the Hendra virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that bats could directly transmit to people HCOV-229E.
On the other hand, while alpha-coronavirus of bats could serve as a gene pool of HCOV-229E virus, alpacas and single camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just like in the case of the MERS-COV virus.
MERS-Cov provides an excellent example of inter-species transmission from bats to single camels and from single camels to man.
The evolution of the MERS-Cov virus from bats is known by its initial identification and was subsequently confirmed by subsequent research.
Obviously, bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for interspecies exchange of gene fragments and interspecies transmission.
Long-term, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and flying ability make bats "ideal proliferators".
On the other hand, the MERS-Cov virus was administered to a single camel a decade ago.
It has adapted well to these camels, which have evolved from an intermediate to a stable and natural reservoir carrier.
In these animals, the MERS-Cov virus causes a very mild disease and has a relatively low frequency of mutations.
His occasional transmission to a human being is an accident, and the person remains a dead end carrier of MERS-Cov, as his transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the MERS-Cov transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus is different.
In particular, pangolin beta coronavirus is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be dead end carriers of beta coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civetes in the case of SARS-Cov.
In future studies, several inter-species transmissions of the SARS-Cov2 virus from animals to humans need to be confirmed or excluded.
First, bats can be a reservoir for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-COV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats through coal mining or cutting off the carcasses of these animals.
Second, pangolins can be one of the intermediate reinforcements to which a related SARS-CoV-2 virus recently entered.
People are infected with the virus through the cutting of carcasses and the use of wild animal meat for food.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-COV-2.
Domestic and wild animal antibodies are justified.
Third, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could take place in a third form, which was in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to different types of animal carriers, three main factors on the virus side have also contributed to the intersection of inter-species barriers.
First of all, they have a relatively high mutation rate in the replication of RNA.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the estimated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered to be "moderately high" with an average replacement frequency of approximately 10 to 4 per year for one site 2 depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to the new owners.
The coronavirus has a corrective exoribonuclease, which is being removed with an extremely high frequency of mutation and weakening or even inviolability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog of Remdesivir suppresses the replication of coronavirus through the inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising tools against SARS-CoV-2 that needs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than their hosts.
Moreover, the frequency of mutation may often be even higher if the coronavirus is not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-Cov with a high mutation frequency, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations appears to be lower, indicating a higher level of human adaptation.
Supposedly, this virus has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-Cov-2, this also applies to MERS-Cov, which is well adapted to single camels.
Theoretically, vaccines and antivirals from SARS-Cov2 are unlikely to become rapidly ineffective as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronavirus leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-species covolution favourable to the emergence of new coronavirus under appropriate conditions.
This is facilitated by the many unique open-reading frameworks and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3°-end of the genome.
Third, thanks to a unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrices during RNA replication.
During the transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in the carrier, which serves as a mixing receptacle, the threads are often switched.
High-mological, full-scale and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronavirus.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCov-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43 and in animal coronavirus, such as SL-Cov and batCov-HKU9 bats.
Interacting virus - carrier with respect to transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, another key factor important for inter-species transmission is the interaction of the virus with the host receptor.
This article provides a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection in inter-species transmission events, of the SARS-Cov recombination.
On the basis of a comparative analysis between SARS-CoV strains of humans and civetes, it is believed that SARS-Cov is undergoing rapid adaptation in different media, especially with regard to mutations on the RSD of squirrel S.
In general, the RSD of the protein S of the coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor, and the antibodies of the host actively select it.
SARS-Cov are amino acids, from 318 to 510 on the S1 fragment that connects to human angiotensinthe enzyme 2 (APF2) and its coceptors to inject the virus into the cell.
The SARS-Cov virus has the ability to recognize APF2 receptors from various animals, including bats, civetes, mice and raccoid dogs, allowing inter-species transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues that differ from human virus strains and civetes were detected in the RSD, 4 of which are in the receptor-linking motive for interacting with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civetes have mutations of K479N and S487T in the RSD, which can increase the affinity of the chopoid protein interaction with the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be particularly important in adapting the virus to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-Cov2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-Cov.
The 30 percent difference between SARS-Cov2 and SARS-Cov in the S1 squirrel segment leads to a change in the binding affinity of S protein to human APF2.
Indeed, a cryo microscope study tells us that the affinity of this connection is 10 to 20 times higher than between APF2 and S-SARS-Cov virus.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other accelerators were required for the transfer of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCov-NL63 also connects to APF2, but to another segment of S protein.
There are many other HCov receptors, such as aminopeptide N for HCOV-229E and 9-O acetalic acid for HCOV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus in humans after inter-species transmission from animal carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of inter-species transfer of HCOV is also controlled by other factors of host dependence and restriction.
Diverging these vector proteins between humans and natural HCoVs storage media, such as bats, single camels and rodents, can be a barrier to inter-species transmission.
Successful inter-species transmission of HCov viruses requires the usurpation of dependency factors and the control of vectors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important field of interaction between the virus and the host still need to be defined and categorized.
An even-handed full-genomic screening of media dependency and restriction factors for SARS-Cov-2 can yield good results using the latest CRISPR technology.
New HCov: Back to zero
The diversity of bat coronavirus creates a great potential for new HCovs.
In this sense, bat coronavirus serves as a genetic pool for HCov.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also driving the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-code genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among the accessor proteins, SARS-Cov is considered important for human adaptation as ORF8, since bat viruses related to SARS-Cov have been isolated, but it has been established that they encode Divergent proteins of ORF8.
In the strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide division was detected, typical of SARS-CoV coronavirus.
This division divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered to be an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of hosts.
In addition, SARS-Cov has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gammacoronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent polymerase.
Localization of recombination was also defined in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV was subjected to recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, recombinant events were also observed in other HCovs, where HCoV was recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, which are likely to result from the removal of the virus from the current selection pressures, such as the immune system of the host.
An example of such effects is the loss of a full-size ORF4 in the prototype HCOV-229E strain due to the binucleotide division.
While the intactic open-reading frame ORF4 can be seen in bat and camel viruses related to HCOV-229E, the Alpaca alpha-coronavirus shows a single-nucleotide box, leading to a shift in the framework.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCov is also due to the pressure of selection on their container carriers.
Infection of bats by coronavirus showed little or no symptoms, indicating mutual adaptation between coronavirus and bats.
It turns out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronavirus.
For example, defects in the activation of an inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronavirus.
In addition, the natural activity of the killer cells in the bats is depressed by the apregilation of the inhibitor receptor of natural killer cells of NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of molecules of the main class I histo-compatibility complex.
Moreover, high levels of active forms of oxygen, which are ensured by high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, simultaneously influencing the reading of exoribonucleasis, thus creating a selection pressure to generate strains of the virus that are highly pathogenic when entering the new host.
The more pathogenic strains of the coronavirus can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the host.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new human coronavirus have emerged in the last 20 years.
The coronavirus is not pathogenic or causes slight symptoms in its reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They replicate with confidence, without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is the secret to why we see unimptomated carriers and what causes severe human infections.
The severe symptoms are mainly associated with hyper-activation of the immune response and cytokin storm, where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung loss.
On the contrary, for unimptomised carriers, the immune response does not involve a replication of the coronavirus.
The same immune response strategy can have beneficial effects in treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The bats have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, the type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, should have a beneficial effect on people.
In addition, the NLRP3-inflammasoma has been disabled in bats.
Based on this, the inhibition of the NLRP3-inflammasoma using the MCC950 may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-Cov-2 follows the general pattern in which SARS-Cov and MERS-COV emerged.
While beta coronavirus of bats was found, the nucleotide homology of which corresponds 95 percent to SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of bats, the nucleotide homology of which corresponds 96% to SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was found that civetes and other animals in the markets were carrying viruses identical to SARS-CoV, there was no direct intermediate delivery for SARS-COV-2.
Betacoronavirus pangolin was discovered, and incredibly homologic SARS-CoV-2, which suggests that pangolins could have been one of the intermediate carriers, or that fragments of the genes of the beta-coronavirus pangolines could have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by a human being.
The coronavirus has attracted the attention of all because of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonosis and HCoV reservative animals in human transmission.
The convincing evidence shows that SARS-Cov, MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov2 are from bats and have been handed over to a person through intermediate carriers.
If the SARS-Cov infection comes from contact between humans and civites in the markets, closing the wild markets and destroying the cyvet in them could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of a variety of beta coronavirus lines of pangolins close to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed to prevent zoonosis transmission from food markets.
However, whether SARS-Cov2 is handed over to a person through pangolins and other mammals, and how this can continue to be the task of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-Cov virus has long existed in single camels.
These camels are an important vehicle as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China's wild animal markets to prevent the proliferation of SARS-Cov and SARS-COV-2.
In order to stop the periodic outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, combined with other infectious control measures.
Because we can't eliminate these viruses, there can be new genotypes that cause disease outbreaks.
There are a variety of zoonosis coronavirus circulations around the world.
In particular, the coronavirus of bats with zoonosis potential is extremely diverse.
There are many possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonosis coronavirus, which in the future will lead to new coronaviruses that are easier to transmit and (or) more lethal to human beings.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.
After severe tests such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19 steels, a better preparedness and response plan is needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new areas can be seized.
Although many of the properties of bats are conducive to the spread of viruses, if people are taught to stay away from them, the probability of human contact with bats and other wild animals can be minimized.
A better understanding of the ecology of coronavirus and its natural carriers requires continuous epidemiological surveillance of mammals, which will be useful in preventing coronavirus transmission from animals to humans and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural zoonosis virus tanks.
Some fragments are still missing in the zoonosis puzzle of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if the bats have passed on the original SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolins, it's interesting to see under what circumstances the bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission of human beings, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if the role of a true intermediate is played by a third mammals, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it's a bat, pangolin, or another mammal, it's expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified from their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for "suspects of disease" and "confirmed cases" COVID-19 should be updated
On 6 February 2020, our group published a short reference manual on the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCov), which provides information on our experiences and recommendations for dealing with the pandemic worldwide.
However, the coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "incidences of suspicion" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the Recommendations on Diagnostics and Treatment for COVID-19 (Seventh Version) issued by the National Health Committee of the PRC.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus, 2019 (2019-nCovV), now officially known as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), broke out, and the virus itself was called severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the infection, our group developed a short reference guide and published it on the Internet on the website of the Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This publication attracted great attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, between 16 January and 3 March 2020, seven issues of the Recommendations on Diagnostics and Treatment for COVID-19 were published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), with some of its provisions significantly changing.
Recently, Zhou ' s work with the co-sponsors commented on our recommendations and contained simple diagnostic proposals based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as valuable background information on this pandemic that has spread throughout the world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the Recommendations on Diagnostics and Treatment for COVID-19 (test version 7) and the results of ongoing research, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh issue of the document (3 March 2020), in order to carry out a comprehensive analysis of suspected cases of disease, one element of epidemiological history must be combined with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movements or locations in and around Wuhan or in other localities where COVID-19 cases were recorded within 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (positive test based on nucleic acids); (3) history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its surroundings or other localities where COVID-19 cases were reported during the past 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases with high temperature or respiratory symptoms recorded within 2 weeks in small areas such as home or apartment, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external exposure to COVID-19; (3) total leukocytes are normal or reduced with reduced lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case of disease should be based on the suspicion of a disease with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-genomic sequence of the virus shows a high hemorrhage of relatively new coronavirus; (3) the positive results of the serotest for the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies IgM and IgG; or the change of the test result from the negative to the positive for the specific SARS-Cov-2 antibodies of IgG, or the rise of the titre at least four times in the recovery phase in relation to the corresponding acute phase indicator.
It may also be noted that a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in respiratory tracts or blood samples was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
The pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); and then in the seventh issue the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers in the search for an optimal set of nucleic acids for rapid diagnosis, as well as in the analysis of respiratory samples, including blood sampling, which improves the availability of different samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirmation of disease.
However, there is growing evidence of the need to be careful in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without expressed symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in Zhou et al. should be updated as it classified persons without clinical symptoms as a "low risk" group.
The evaluation system also needs to be refined in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we look forward to receiving more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspects of disease" and "confirmed cases", we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations made in the countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 — daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 in a day.
That's the largest number of deaths from the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Disease epidemiology, Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases as well as 33 recovering patients who were at home were registered cases of infection.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said that four men and one woman were victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of those who died were over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years of age, and one between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also reported that the two victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A clinic official informed the local news agency, Anadolu, that one of the victims was Jalal Sayfur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Maitri's Kuwaiti clinic.
On Saturday, in an online video, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Kwader, announced that public transport would be discontinued for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transport was suspended on 26 March and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods — medicine, fuel and food — was still authorized.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March for two persons who had returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three people had already recovered.
SARS-Cov2 has reached the millionth line of infection worldwide.
According to Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday, the total number of coronavirus infections in SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded 1 million.
The coronavirus COVID-19 killed at least 52,000 people.
Rubej arrived on the same day, when Malawi confirmed the first case of infection and Zambia recorded the first case of coronavirus death.
North Korea claimed that, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries where there were no cases of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in 24 hours, up to 10:00 UTC time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 coronavirus-related deaths were reported on Wednesday in the United States.
Countries around the world have announced increased measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyan, extended the self-isolation regime of the citizens of the city until 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin had previously stated that Russians throughout the country, despite self-insulation, would be paid until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of an extension of the state of emergency for 15 days; the result was 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 1 against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, whereas previously the curfew lasted only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to impose a curfew from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike Dewein, announced that the state's home-based isolation regime had been extended until May 1.
Shops in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at a single time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australia's Woolworths and Colles stores reduced the number of toilet paper packages that could be purchased once in all the country's stores to two and one package, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a limit on one package.
These restrictions were reported on the cashier ' s ads as well as on the Facebook page.
Citizens reportedly began to make emergency supplies because of fears that COVID-19 might lead to the introduction of a general self-isolation regime.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the amount of toilet paper being purchased to one package.
Previously, on March 4 and March 5 respectively, Woolworths and Colles had already limited this quantity to four packages.
The Coles trading network reported in its press release of 8 March that, with the restriction on four packages, "a lot of stores still sell toilet paper too quickly — one delivery within an hour", and called such demand "unprecedented", while ALDI, on Facebook, published on Tuesday, called this trend "unexpected".
According to Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited that amount to two packages.
To fill the deficit, Coles ordered larger shipments from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made reserves for a special early sale on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, reported that the RTs were trying to replenish the stock, but this was hampered by restrictions on the local authorities ' travel schedules for trucks.
It expected an increase in the cost of products, as suppliers sought to meet demand, but less and less favourable offers were available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that owing to the depletion of stocks, some shops could not hold shares on Wednesdays.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer at Queensland University of Technology, said that shops are replenishing supplies every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a bulky commodity, so the stock was small and, after the sale of the entire volume of the goods, long series of shelves remained empty, increasing the feeling of lack of stock.
"Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers probably wouldn't panic like that," says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the producer of processed toilet paper Who Gives a Crap reported that the stocks had ended.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a toilet paper company, Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent products, reported that they worked 24 hours a day to ensure sufficient supplies.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne decreased due to the absence of buyers during the week of Labour Day, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first bidders.
The Thursday edition of the daily NT News, published in Darwin, included an eight-page tab designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to the ABC Australia report of 3 March, stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, claiming that they were not planning to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, gallantry, hand washers and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the online shop of the British Ocado supermarket also restricted the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization announces the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of COVID-19 infectious disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-COV-2.
Although the term "pandemia" refers only to the extent of the disease and not to the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national Governments need to take action:
"All countries together are still in a position to influence the development of the pandemic."
This is possible if countries are involved in the identification, testing, treatment, isolation, surveillance and mobilization of their citizens," explained the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom Gebreiss.
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming prevalence and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented".
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that "no respiratory virus other than influenza has yet been monitored from its inception to its continued global spread".
Mr. Gebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that "we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before."
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance and then granted it a new status, a pandemic.
The director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infective Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauchi, said, "This is just the beginning, it's gonna get worse."
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide on Thursday, and more than 4,600 people died.
The coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020 is a currently occurring pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome –2 (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and an international public health emergency was declared on 30 January 2020, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is 4 per cent, while in the world it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficult breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The period from the first symptom to peak is usually about five days, but may also range from two to fourteen days.
At present, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and the recommended preventive measures include hand washing, cough cover, respect for human distance, and identification and self-isolation of people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk control and closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has resulted in serious global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as widespread shortages of goods, compounded by panicary purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world ' s students.
Disinformation about the virus has begun to spread on the Internet, xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese citizens, other East and South-East Asian citizens, or people reminiscent of them, and other groups living in areas where the virus has spread significantly.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased as a result of reduced travel and closure of heavy industry.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of the city of Ouhan (Hubai Province Capital), China, reported cases of pneumonia with unknown cause, and an investigation into the situation was initiated in early January 2020.
Infections were mainly related to the wholesale market for Juanan seafood, so the virus is believed to be of zoonosis origin.
The virus that triggered the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that has a great resemblance to the coronavirus of bats, the coronavirus of pangolin and SARS-Cov. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease occurred on 1 December 2019, and the infected did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the cases reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, in a publication by the South China office of Morning Post, which was unverified, it was suggested that the very first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei Province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had decreased, but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that the number of new infections outside China for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.
The incidence of disease may be significantly understated, in particular because of the many cases with low symptoms.
By 26 February, there had been relatively few cases of infection among young people, with patients aged 19 and under accounting for less than 2.4 per cent of the world ' s cases, and the Chief Scientific Adviser of the United Kingdom, Patrick Wallans, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until an effective group immunity was established in the country.
Statistics include cases of contamination of people who have been tested at COVID-19 and whose test proved to be positive according to official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had adopted a formal policy requiring that only minor symptoms not be tested.
A study published on 16 March found that 86 per cent of COVID-19 cases had not been detected in China before 23 January and that 79 per cent of reported cases had been infected by such unregistered patients.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual cases in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number of infections (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
In a study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, it is estimated that this could be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients are recovering safely.
In other, more complex cases, the period from the onset of symptoms to the moment of death ranged from 6 to 41 days, the most frequent being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, about 80 per cent of deaths on 5 February were over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of deaths were associated with related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include deaths of patients with positive results from COVID tests performed under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may exclude deceased persons who have not been tested, for example in the event of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded official COVID figures by four to five.
The U.S. Press Secretary for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: "We know that [the reported number of deaths] is lower than actual." His words are confirmed by reports of some isolated cases in the U.S., which are often not fully accounted for in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was recorded in Ouhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on 1 February in the Philippines and outside Asia in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents other than Antarctica had reported deaths; several methods were usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary from region to region and from time to time; they are also influenced by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment patterns used, the time since the outbreak of the disease, and the population parameters such as age, sex and general health; the death/disease ratio is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality-to-mortality ratio fell from 17.3 per cent (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the determination of the percentage of deaths due to illness (CFR) — the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from disease and the percentage of deaths due to infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of certain population groups from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
According to estimates by the Centre for Evidence Medicine of Oxford University, the overall mortality rate from the pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first arbitrary COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be monitored.
The peak and exact duration of the flash cannot be determined and may vary from location to location.
Matsei Boni, an employee of the University of Pennsylvania, states that "uncontrollable infectious outbreaks tend to reach the plateau and then, when the number of available vectors ends, they begin to fall out.
However, in the current situation it is almost impossible to make any reasonable forecast as to when this will happen."
Senior Medical Adviser to the Chinese Government, Zhong Nanshan, states that "it can all end by June" if all countries are able to mobilize and implement the WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will circulate perhaps for a year or two".
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, "until the vaccine (perhaps 18 months or more) is established", physical distance and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, an employee of Vanderbilt University, says, "I don't think this coronavirus will ever disappear for ever, because it's so easily transmitted," and that it can "be turned into a seasonal disease, exploding every year."
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively unspecific, and some infected people may suffer without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are elevated temperatures (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, urination in the respiratory tract (slurp), loss of smell, breathing, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headaches, chills, vomiting, haemorrhage, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO claims to be seriously ill with respiratory problems of about one in six people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list urgent symptoms such as respiratory distress, permanent pain or chest depression, sudden sense of confusion, trouble waking up and blueing the face or lips. If these symptoms are present, immediate treatment should be sought; further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, septics, septic shock, and death.
Some infected people may have an unimptomized disease, without any clinical evidence, but the results confirm the infection, so doctors recommend that those in close contact with confirmed patients be placed under strict surveillance and subject to screening for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of impotent currents varies from a few to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (time between infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; it usually takes five days; it is not yet fully clear on the symptoms of loss of smell: the percentage of COVID-19 patients who developed this symptom was initially 30 per cent and then dropped to 15 per cent.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as by small drops, released into the air with cough, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of between 1 and 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, in open cough, drops can spread from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets thrown into the air during a conversation that can remain in the air for longer periods of time. Respiratory drops can also be generated by exhalation, including during a conversation, although the virus is usually not transported by air.
The drops can enter the mouth or nose of people in the vicinity, as well as the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (HRM), may lead to the spraying of exhalation products and therefore to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if the person touches the contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted via feces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted facularally. The virus is the most contagious during the first three days after the symptoms occur, although its spread may occur before the symptoms occur and at later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where the tests were positive three days before the symptoms appeared, indicating that the virus could be transmitted before the symptoms were expressed.
There are only a few reports of laboratory confirmed cases of unimptomized disease, but contact-tracking studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from unimptomated carriers.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claims that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infects two or three other people; the virus is able to survive from hours to days on the surface.
In particular, it was found that on plastic surface (polypropylene) and stainless steel (304), the virus could live for up to three days, on cardboard surface for one day and on copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature, with a positive result from COVID-19 for domestic and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, just as they do after contact with other surfaces to which infected people may have touched.
The severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus discovered for the first time in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Ouhana.
All the signs of a new SARS-Cov2 virus are found in nature in related coronavirus. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed with a household soap that dissolves its protective shell.
He is believed to be of zoonosis.
A genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it was genetically clustered with the species Betacoronavirus, a sub-type of Sarbecovirus (cellular line B), together with two other strains of bat viruses.
On a holistic-genomic level, it is 96% identical to other samples of the bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids between certain parts of the genome of pangolin and human viruses.
A whole-genomic comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage of similarities (92 per cent) exists between the coronavirus of pangolin and SARS-Cov-2, but this is not enough to prove that the pangolins are intermediate owners of the virus.
The virus may be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although this should ultimately be confirmed by a polymersal chain reaction with a reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of an infected secret or computer tomography.
A study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Ouhan showed that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonias and currents.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19 diagnostics".
WHO published several RNA testing protocols on SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
A real-time polymeric chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is being carried out.
It can be performed on breathing samples and on blood samples.
Results are usually available for periods ranging from hours to days.
The test usually uses a sock swab, although a ghetto swab may also be used; a number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none had been accurate enough to obtain approval for universal application.
In the U.S., the serrological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristic features of the visualization of the symptoms in X-rays and CTs include asymmetric peripheral fuzzys of the type of matt glass and the absence of flurry sweats.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for developing an international database of confirmed cases of contamination.
Due to similarities with other infections, such as the adenovyrus, the identification of COVID-19 images not supported by PCR tests has limited clinical specificity.
In China, a major study comparing thorax CT results with PCR testing was carried out and it was found that, while the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be deciphered faster; they were also more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method could be considered as a screening tool in contaminated areas.
To diagnose the virus using X-rays and CT scans, surgical neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, and using napkins in coughing or sneezing, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already have been infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to be physically separated from people; many Governments recommend refraining from any irregular travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restricting the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus has been able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is distributed to the population, some members of which do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended that health care providers who care for patients who may be infected should use standard precautions, as well as precautions in contact with others and eye protection. Contact tracing is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent its further spread.
The use by Governments of data on the whereabouts of citizens using their mobile phones for that purpose had raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International, as well as more than 100 other organizations, had made statements calling for the restriction of that type of human surveillance.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working to develop solutions that ensure confidentiality of personal data, such as recording user proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user was in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test proved to be positive, he will be notified accordingly. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection — for example, a nose and mouth strip, which is not really effective.
At present, there is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC (the Center for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends that hands with soap and water should be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or when there is heavy hand pollution, and before eating, after snotting, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because, outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic soap that opens its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends the use of disinfectants to treat hands on a alcohol-based basis with at least 60% alcohol.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be de-polified by a number of solutions (the stainless steel surface of the disinfectant begins to operate a minute after application) with 62 - 71% ethanol, 50 - 100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2 - 7.5 % lipid yode.
Other components, such as benzalonia chloride and chlorhexidin gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, in cases of suspicion of COVID or its confirmation in an institution such as an office or a day-care facility, all spaces of such space, including offices, toilets, public spaces, electronic equipment such as tablets, sensor screens, keyboards, remote control panels and ATMs used by sick people, should be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that, when coughing or sneezing, cover the mouth and nose with the back of the elbow or napkin and immediately throw out the hygiene items used.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as the use of a mask may limit the volume and range of exhales that are dispersed in the air during conversation, sneezing and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "the use of a medical mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, and touching their faces with dirty hands is the main means of infection." The masks are also recommended for use by those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of a mask actually reduces the number of face-to-face touches.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of health masks in public places.
CDC Centers, U.S.A., recommend wearing tissue face masks for non-medical purposes, and China specifically stressed the importance of using one-time medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
It is recommended that Hong Kong wear a medical mask in public transport or public places.
Thailand ' s health officials encourage people to make and wash face masks at home on a daily basis.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from going out without masks covering their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has obliged all customers to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel has also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks per day have been produced since mid-March, the use of medical masks was ordered for all passengers on trains and coaches.
In Panama, residents were required to wear a medical mask when they went outside; those who could not afford masks were advised to sew them on their own in the home.
Medical masks are also widely used by Japanese, South Korean, Malaysian and Singapore residents.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is an anti-infection measure designed to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, jobs, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures to stay at home, restrict travel, avoid public spaces, use unconnected greetings and physically distance from others.
Many Governments in the regions, particularly those severely affected by the outbreak, currently prescribe or recommend social distance.
The maximum number of people who could meet in one place, as recommended by the U.S. government and health organizations, was rapidly reduced from 250 (in regions where COVID-19 was not available) to 50 and later to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned members of groups of more than two people from meeting; elderly people and people suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of contracting the virus in a serious form. CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak in the region. In late March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began replacing the term "social distance" with "physical distance", thus clarifying the purpose of this measure to reduce physical contact in social relationships, whether through virtual communication or physical distance.
The use of the term "social distance" was understood to mean that people should be subjected to total social exclusion rather than remaining in contact with others in alternative ways, and some agencies had published guidelines on sexual health to be used during the pandemic.
Among others, it has been recommended to have sexual intercourse only with your permanent partners with whom you live, and with whom you are confident that he does not have the virus and its symptoms.
Persons diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected are advised to self-isolate in the home.
Health institutions have issued detailed instructions on appropriate self-isolation, and many Governments have also introduced mandatory or recommended that the entire population of the affected areas be quarantined.
Those at high risk were ordered to have the highest quarantine rate.
Those who may have been in contact with COVID-19 or have recently visited a country or region heavily affected by the epidemic have been advised to remain quarantined within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Flash control strategies include containment, control or mitigation of the disease.
The control of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and is designed to track and isolate the infected, as well as other infectious control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a stage where the spread of the disease is no longer sustainable, efforts are being made to mitigate the effects: measures are being taken to slow down the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
Infection control requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline infection rate to below 1. Some of the efforts to manage an outbreak of infectious disease are aimed at reducing the epidemic peak known as the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and allow more time for the development of vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to cope with the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, medical masks and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical isolation, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of mass events; community involvement in and participation in such measures; and environmental protection measures such as surface cleaning. After China ' s severity of the outbreak became apparent, more decisive action was taken to contain outbreaks, such as isolation of entire cities and strict travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, as well as an alert system for the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to infected self-insured persons and heavy fines were imposed on those who failed to do so.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks has increased and penalties have been imposed for the accumulation of excess stocks of medicines, and modelling across the United Kingdom and the United States has shown that there are serious challenges to mitigating (slowing down, but not stopping, the spread of the epidemic) and suppressing (stopping the growth of the epidemic).
Optimal policies to mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3 and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Pressure may be the preferred method, but it should be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or until the vaccine is developed if it occurs sooner), because otherwise the spread of the disease will resume quickly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic have resulted in social and economic costs.
Antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19 treatment do not currently exist, but efforts are under way to develop them, including testing of existing drugs.
The use of non-preceptive cold medication, sufficient fluids, and rest can help to alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may require oxygen therapy, fluid injection and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can only hurt.
Several compounds previously approved for other viral diseases are also being considered for COVID-19 treatment.
WHO also reported that some "traditional and domestic remedies" could alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO sees capacity-building and adaptation of health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as the primary response to an outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health-care services to facilitate the redistribution of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, the elimination of irregular procedures, where possible, the detection and isolation of patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as the expansion of intensive care through training of staff and the increase in the number of available IVL and bed facilities.
There are different theories about where the very first case of infection may have arisen, the so-called "zero patient".
The first known case of a new coronavirus infection probably occurred on 1 December 2019 in the city of Ouhan Province of Hubei, China.
The number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei province gradually increased during the month.
They were mainly linked to the Juanan seafood wholesale market, where live animals were also sold, and one theory was that the virus had been infested into the human body by one of these animals; in other words, the virus was of zoonosis origin. On 26 December, the Hubei province clinic recorded a case of a massive pneumonia of unknown origin, with which Zhang Tianjin, a doctor, had been working, reporting the case to the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Huhan City on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors from the central clinic in Ouhan warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenlyang, were warned by the police that they were responsible for spreading false rumours, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by his superiors for causing panic.
Later, on 31 December, the Uhana Municipal Health Commission published a public notice and informed WHO of the situation.
The Uhanya health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which proved to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January; at the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, facilitated by China's New Year's holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to the latest official data, 6,174 people had developed symptoms of the disease by 20 January 2020; as at 26 March, the United States had outrun China and Italy for the largest number of confirmed cases in the world; as at 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people had died and more than 364,000 had recovered.
Some 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported case of contamination.
Due to the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area restricted free movement and established border controls.
National responses included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory home stay, compulsory shelter or isolation), as well as curfew; as at 2 April, some 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population of the United States, were in some form of quarantine; more than 50 million people were in isolation in the Philippines; some 59 million people were in isolation in South Africa; and 1.3 billion people in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later the figure rose to 2.6 billion — about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Ouhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, whose credibility was not verified, this date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Zhang Jixiyan ' s doctor worked on a mass case of pneumonia of unknown type, which was notified by her clinic on 27 December to the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan City.
The initial genetic testing of patients ' samples, which took place on 27 December 2019, revealed the existence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Uhana issued a public notice.
WHO was notified the same day.
In response to these notifications, the police warned the doctors in Ouhan that they were responsible for spreading rumours about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of the ability of the newly discovered virus to be transmitted from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was later called the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping "the People's War".
The events of "the largest quarantine in the history of mankind" began to unfold, and on 23 January a health cordon was announced and a ban on entry to and from Wuhan was subsequently imposed on a total of 15 towns in Hubei province, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
There was a ban on the use of personal transportation in the city.
In many places, the celebration of the Chinese New Year (25 January) was cancelled.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Huosheneshhan, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital was built, Leishchen, which received other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly constructed hospitals, China has also reassigned 14 other Uhan facilities, such as conference centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health certificates for travellers and the extension of the Chinese New Year celebrations.
Universities and schools have been closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced remote working arrangements.
Travel restrictions have been imposed in and outside Hubei province.
The public transport schedule has been changed and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
Many cities have introduced a regime to control the movement of citizens, and it has been estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) have experienced some form of open-air restrictions, and since the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, in Beijing, a 14-day mandatory quarantine had been introduced for all international travellers entering the city; as of 23 March, only one domestic transmission had been registered in mainland China, five days earlier, in this case from a person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the incidence of domestic transmissions had been largely halted and the outbreak in China had been brought under control.
On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubei, other than Uhan, were lifted, two months after the closure of the province for quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for persons holding a visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March.
Those wishing to come to China would be required to apply for a visa from Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on enterprises and factories to resume operations and provided companies with monetary stimulus packages. On 4 April, at 10 a.m., a national three-minute silence was held, which opened a day of mourning for the victims of the coronavirus, announced by the State Council of the country, which coincided with the Quinnin festival, but the central government asked citizens to pay tribute to the dead online, while maintaining physical distance, in order to avoid a recurrence of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, largely due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchongji in Tegu.
Shinchongji's followers arrived in Tega from Uhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, of the 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported showing symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea announced the highest level of alarm.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were reported in Korea, and as of 29 February, the rate had risen to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers were tested for the virus.
The outbreak had an impact on the number of trips, so the airline flight schedule had been changed. South Korea had launched a screening programme for the virus, contact tracking and quarantine arrangements for contact persons; the programme was considered the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
The screening methods included mandatory information on their symptoms via a mobile application to all those who had come from abroad, a universal virus test, which had been completed the following day, and an increase in testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested every day.
South Korea's program is considered successful in combating the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that entire cities have not been isolated there; initially, South Korean society was divided by President Moon Jae-yung's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for the Government ' s perceived inadequate response to the outbreak.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases per day for four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea requested assistance in testing 121 countries for the virus.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kuma, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers and the closure of universities, universities and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani announced on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to restrict long-distance travel were announced in March, but intensive inter-city travel continued before the Persian New Year.
The Shiite shrines in Kuma remained open to the pilgrims until 16 March 2020, and Iran became the centre of the spread of the virus after China in February.
Against the backdrop of allegations of concealment of the scale of the outbreak in Iran, by 28 February, more than 10 countries had linked their disease to Iran, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be greater than the 388 cases recorded by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members reported on 3 March that the test results for the virus were positive.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch (Human Rights Watch) called on the Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as to release temporarily all prisoners eligible for this category.
The organization states that there is an increased risk that the virus will spread in closed institutions, such as prisons where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day, the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 active or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By 23 March, 50 new cases of coronavirus had been reported in Iran every hour and one new death from coronavirus every 10 minutes.
According to the representative of WHO, the incidence rate in Iran could be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
It is also assumed that US sanctions against Iran could affect the country's financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called for the easing of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease had reached Italy when two Chinese tourists tested for SARS-Cov2 in Rome had a positive effect.
The number of infections has increased rapidly, prompting the Government of Italy to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare a state of emergency.
A non-associated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later discovered. It began with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, under which more than 50,000 persons from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were quarantined.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "The entrance to and exit from the outbreak zone will be blocked.
On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, since 100 people had already died in Italy.
All major sports events, including the A-series football matches, were to take place behind closed doors until April, but all sports events were postponed for at least one month on 9 March.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of enterprises, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Treatment (SIARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics with regard to the protocols for prioritizing the provision of medical care to patients, which may have to be used.
On 19 March, Italy overstepped China's coronavirus mortality rate, ranked first in the world, following the announcement of 3,405 deaths.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of recovery, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardia region.
A CNN report notes that a combination of two factors can contribute to this high mortality rate in Italy: the large number of elderly citizens in Italy and the inability to examine all those who are currently suffering from coronavirus.
The United Kingdom reacted to the virus with the most calm of all the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not oblige citizens to follow any form of social separation or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was criticized for not being quick and serious enough to respond to the danger faced by the country ' s population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all travel and social contacts that were not of primary importance should be refrained from inviting people to work from home whenever possible and to avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than Pound2,500 per month, as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more severe social separation measures, prohibiting more than two people from meeting and limiting travel and active outdoor rest only to cases of extreme necessity.
In contrast to previous measures, these restrictions were imposed with the use of the police, the imposition of fines and the dismantling of populations.
Most enterprises have been ordered to close down, except for those that provide "life expectancy" for the population, including supermarkets, drugstores, banks, shops, petrol stations and garages.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading public health organization of the U.S. Government, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite this, testing of the population in the United States did not begin immediately, and the true extent of the outbreak was hidden during this period.
The testing was hampered by the marriage of test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, the lack of Federal Government authorization by the end of February to use non-State test kits developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, and restrictive criteria before early March that would allow citizens to be tested (this could only be done upon appointment of a doctor).
The Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States by 27 February.
The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been performed by March 13.
On 22 March, Associated Press reported: "A large number of patients, even with symptoms and appointments, were waiting for their turn to be tested for hours or days." After the first coronavirus death in the United States was reported from Washington State on 29 February, Governor Jay Insley announced a state of emergency, which was also soon announced by other states.
On 3 March, schools in Seattle were cancelled, and by mid-March, schools were closed throughout the country. On 6 March 2020, an epidemic team of Imperial Colleges, London, informed the United States of the projected impact of the new coronavirus on the country.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Additional Appropriations for Preparedness and Response to Coronavirus Act, which provided the federal authorities with $8.3 billion in emergency assistance to respond to an outbreak of disease.
Corporations imposed travel restrictions on staff members, cancelled conferences and encouraged staff to work from home.

Based on information from the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the largest number of travelers from Uhan.
Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali was identified as the least prepared for the outbreak, while Australian cities were considered the most prepared. On 7 February, Australia adopted its New Coronavirus Emergency Plan (COVID-19).
In this regard, it is stated that much remains to be learned about COVID-19 and that Australia will pay particular attention to border control and communication in a threat situation.
On 21 March, Australia declared a human biosafety emergency.

In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, South African Airways, chartered by the Government of South Africa, flew with 112 South African nationals on board.
Prior to the flight, a medical examination of the passengers was carried out, and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus were left in China to reduce risk.
Only South Africans with negative tests on the coronavirus were evacuated.
The tests were taken from all South African citizens, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, and as a precautionary measure, all remained under surveillance and were quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort.

Later, he also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks and 5 IVL machines to Panama.
The Czech Republic, Georgia, the Netherlands and Spain expressed concern about medical masks and test kits for Chinese production.
For example, Spain had withdrawn 58,000 Chinese coronavirus test kits, which ensured accuracy of only 30 per cent, while the Netherlands had withdrawn 600,000 defective Chinese medical masks.
Belgium had also withdrawn 100,000 unusable medical masks, which were supposed to have been manufactured in China, but were later found to have come from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese assistance was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency relief operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of infection.
WHO noted clear differences between the situation with the outbreak of SARS in 2002 - 2004, in which Chinese authorities were accused of classified information, which allegedly prevented prevention and containment of the disease, on the one hand, and the current crisis, in which the central Government "have regularly updated the situation in order to avoid panic on the eve of the New Year of China".
On 23 January, in response to a decision by the central authorities to ban movement in Ouhan, the representative of WHO, Goden Galea, noted that, although "this measure was not explicitly recommended by WHO", it was also "a very important confirmation of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the site of the greatest spread", and called it "unprecedented in public health history". On 30 January, after confirmation of the ability to transmit the infection from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of infections in other countries, WHO declared an emergency in the public health system of international importance (PHEIC), the sixth since 2009, when it was first applied during the swine influenza pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, stated that the announcement of PHEIC was due to "the rhetoric of global proliferation, especially in low- and middle-income countries without reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international movement and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO requested the global community to provide $675 million for strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting on the need to provide urgent assistance to those countries that "have no systems to identify people infected with the virus despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries".
Mr. Tedros also stated that "the indicator of our preparedness is the level of preparedness for the epidemic at our weakest level" and called on the international community to "take a choice: to invest today or to pay in the future." At a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrish had agreed to provide "the potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem".
As a result, the UN Crisis Management Group was established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, WHO states, will allow "to focus on the health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to deal with disease outbreaks in a broader social and economic sense".
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated a joint ad hoc team that provided international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in the management of the domestic situation and to assess the "seriousity of the disease and its contamination", organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess "the effectiveness of the provincial and district response, including urban and rural areas". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that "it is too early to call the disease a pandemic, but countries must nevertheless be prepared".
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the probability of global coronavirus spreading would be raised from "high" to "very high", the highest degree of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, the Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in his statement: "This is the test of every government on the planet to be ready for reality: it's time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be ready" and stressed that the right response could help the world avoid "the worst scenario".
Ryan also stated that current data did not warrant the proclamation of a global pandemic by public health officials, and added that the declaration of a pandemic would mean that "we in fact recognize that every human being on the planet would be at risk of contracting the virus".
On 11 March, WHO announced the outbreak of the coronavirus of the pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO "is deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction in this regard." WHO is seriously criticized for the perceived inadequate approach to the notion of a pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a response to the situation, a petition had been submitted to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, requesting the resignation of 733,000 persons as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Expert Group stated that everyone had the right to life-saving measures against him and that the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Panel stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including for persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as feedback and advice.
The digital node provides information on the policy measures taken by different countries (country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the world economy, eliminate the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Chinese Government has been criticized by the United States, the British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove and Eduardo Bolsonar, the son of President Jair Bolsonar of Brazil, for the action taken to combat the pandemic that began in Hubei Province of China.
Several leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) at the provincial level were dismissed for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and those dismissals indicated dissatisfaction with the political response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from public anger over the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lizjan, disagreed with an earlier statement that the outbreak of the coronavirus had begun in Ouhan, but took sides with the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 had arisen in the US or Italy.
President Donald Trump's administration referred to the coronavirus as "Chinese virus" or "Uhana virus", stating that "censorship in China only exacerbates the situation of the virus, which has now become a global pandemic", a statement that has been criticized by some commentators who claim that such an approach is racist and "exceeds from the US President's inability to contain the spread of the disease".
The Daily Beast has access to a U.S. government telegram that contains a communication strategic trick, apparently invented by the National Security Council, with such references to the strategy: "It's all in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television speeches." Organizations such as Policy, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to assist countries affected by the virus are part of the "advocacy" to gain global influence.
The head of the EU foreign policy agency, Josep Borrell, warned of the presence of a "geopolitic component, including the struggle for influence through the PR and the so-called policy of generosity".
Borrell also stated that "China is strongly promoting its role as a responsible and reliable partner, as opposed to the US".
China also called on the US to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, with some indications of sending aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned by the U.S. sanctions imposed on April 3.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of diverting aid to other countries to their own country.
Other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy, also had disputes about medical masks.
In addition, Turkey has embezzled hundreds of IVL vehicles destined for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for the coronavirus-affiliated Italy.
Mauricio Massari, Italy's Ambassador to the EU, said that "only China responded bilaterally.
This clearly does not reflect European solidarity."
On 22 March, following a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Italy, Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for Russian military nurses, specialized disinfectant transport and other medical equipment to go to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous "high-level political source" claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was "unhelpful or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of seeking to give a favourable impression to world public opinion at the "geopolitical and diplomatic" level.
President Lombardia Attilio Fontana and Minister for Foreign Affairs Luigi Di Mayo of Italy rejected the media attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
The spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitri Peskov, stated that "by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Podin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase their production rates, they will also be able to respond if necessary".
The NATO Defenceer 2020 military exercises planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries — the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the cold war — will be conducted in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Keith Hudson, criticized Defender 2020's teachings: "In the current public health crisis, these exercises threaten not only the lives of the US military and many European member countries, but also the people of the countries where such events are to take place." Iran's government has been severely affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of Parliament, as well as 15 other current or former political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in an open letter, appealed to world leaders for help, stating that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets due to the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran, and that the epidemic had led to calls for the adoption of social policies by the United States in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a unified health and child care system, paid family leave and increased funding for public health.
Political scientists expected that this might have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election, and the pandemic has led to a deterioration in diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea criticized Japan's "different and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen coming from South Korea would be placed on a two-week quarantine in government-provided seats.
South Korean society was originally divided by the reaction of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans had signed petitions that had either praised the President ' s actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for the Government ' s perceived inadequate response to the outbreak, and the Pandemia had forced countries to enact emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators express concern that this step will enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Victor Orban the indefinite right to administer through decrees, suspend Parliament, and hold elections and punish those who would be accused of spreading faeces about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The outbreak of the coronavirus was cited as the cause of several supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the buying of goods in panic and the disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Quality Authority issued warnings of shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier failures.
Panic purchases also took place in several locations, resulting in the disappearance of essential goods, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, from the shelves of shops, which in turn resulted in a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100fold.
This surge resulted in a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the normal price, as well as delays in the delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
He also caused a lack of personal protection facilities worldwide, and WHO warned that health workers would be at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has given Daigow buyers a new opportunity to sell Australian products to China.
These activities led to a shortage of infant food in some supermarkets and were subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high incidence of COVID-19 in North Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food, severe food shortages have been avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and illegal trade in critical products have been successful in avoiding the severe food shortages expected in Europe, as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, with small agricultural production, did not experience significant declines, but industry believed that agricultural prices could rise.
The shelves of food shops remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Ouhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork stocks to ensure that the population was fed.
Similar laws requiring food producers to maintain food reserves in case of emergency exist in Italy.
China was affected by the damage to the world economy: according to the media of 16 March, China ' s economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 by government measures to combat the spread of the virus, which reduced retail sales by 20.5 per cent.
The mainland China is a major economic and productive centre; it is therefore believed that the viral outbreak poses a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to Agatha Demarai, the Economist Intelligence Unit staff member, market volatility will persist until there is a clearer understanding of potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could outweigh the effects of the 2002 - 2004 SARS epidemic.
According to an expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis, the damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has taken "urgent measures" following a sharp decline in oil prices due to China's falling demand.
On 24 February, world stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the outbreak of coronavirus, various US stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Daw Jones index for industrial companies, showed the largest drop since 2008, with the Dow index falling by 1,191 points, the largest one-day fall since the 2007–2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed a drop of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
The stocks fell again because of fear of the spread of the coronavirus, and the biggest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a possibility of an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks react faster than in the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in relation to travel bans, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of Governments not to undertake any travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in the demand for air tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe has ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has proved to be stronger than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of China's New Year's celebrations.
National and regional Governments had cancelled a number of large-scale events, including the annual New Year ' s Festivals; private companies had also closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands.
Many of the New Year's events had been cancelled and tourist attractions had been closed in order to prevent mass crowds; for example, the Ban City had been closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs had been abolished.
In 24 of China ' s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, the authorities extended the New Year ' s holiday until 10 February, ordering most enterprises not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and canceling the New Year ' s celebrations; the retail sector was affected globally: shop hours were reduced and some shops were temporarily closed.
Retail point visits in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
Distributors in North America and the Middle East reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, trade centre attendance dropped by 33 - 43 per cent in March compared to February.
Trade centre operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, installation of equipment to check the temperature of visitors and cancellation of activities; according to the assessment of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic could leave more people behind the poverty line than would have been the case in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, in the midst of an epidemic in Ouhan, some 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of China ' s 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves at home in their own provinces or locked up in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
According to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, the outbreak of coronavirus could deprive 47 million people of their jobs and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent. Self-isolation measures introduced in India would leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers on a daily basis unemployed. A study conducted by the Angus Reid Institute showed that 44 per cent of Canadian households had experienced unemployment in one way or another. Almost 900,000 Spanish workers had also lost jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit, and almost half a million companies in Germany transferred their employees to a government-subsidized reduced part-time work schedule.
The German part-time pay scheme has also been introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
Arts and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by a pandemic that has affected organizations, as well as individuals, whether formally employed or independent, around the world.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (often State-funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their staff and the public, as well as supporting the arts where possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed for indefinite periods worldwide, or access to them had been restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and performances had been cancelled or postponed.
In return, considerable efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms; another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus was the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
There have also been disruptions in the film industry, and the Vatican announced the cancellation of the Good Week in Rome, which is being held during the last week of the Christian penitent period, the Great Post.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and do not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services have begun to broadcast on radio, live, or television, while some church leaders have offered outdoor worship.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed its churches, chapels and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims were no longer present, and other religious organizations later also abolished religious services and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gourders.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of the coronavirus, and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned access by foreign pilgrims and its own residents to the holy sites of Makkah and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the world sports calendar since the Second World War.
Most of the major sports events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-20, the 2019–20 premiere league, Euro2020 UEFA, NBA 2019–20 and NHL 2019–20 season.
The outbreak of the coronavirus also destroyed the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "delayed beyond 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021." The casinos and other gambling facilities around the world were closed, and the poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast live, were also either postponed or cancelled.
This has led many players to go online, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, and the entertainment industry has also suffered because various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway theatres, also canceled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results over the Internet, organizing live webcasts or web festivals; this helps artists to continue to perform, produce or publish their works.
There are many online memes on the subject of coronavirus, many of which are humorous and smooth out the alarming moods that characterize periods of uncertainty.
Since the advent of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as people from hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
The February news reports (when most of the infections were still confined to China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly earned the virus or received just retribution for anything.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many of Uhan and Hubei residents reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
China ' s citizens, as well as those living in virus-affected areas, were supported both offline and online.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, in particular Italy, the first country in Europe to face a serious COVID-19 outbreak; thus, citizens of such regions may also feel the effects of suspicion and xenophobia; nationals of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed a petition at an early stage, insisting on prohibiting Chinese nationals from entering their countries in order to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#Chinan Not Come Japan) held a leading position on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report a growing level of racist sentiment and even attacks.
President Donald Trump of the United States faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus"; critics consider that opinion racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuating from Uhan to New Sanjara.
Students coming from north-eastern India bordering China and studying in major cities in India reported cases of harassment related to the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Dileep Ghosh, President of the State Unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Western Bengal, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "therefore God took revenge on them".
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called them "mistakes." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents resurfaced as a result of the pandemic: foreigners were referred to as "foreign garbage" and "recyclable" objects.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have publicly published their scientific articles on the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some scientists have decided to provide short-term access to their research results on the printing servers of their pre-prints, such as BioRxiv.
Communicable infectious disease is an infectious disease from a returning pathogen whose range or mode of transmission is often unknown.

The smuggling of wild animals and animal-borne diseases are health risks associated with the trade in exotic animals.
Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is only designed to detect SARS-COV-2 RNAs.
It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnostic and population control purposes.
Antibodies tests reveal the number of people who suffered from the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated at the hospital or not at all.
The exact mortality rate from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, owing to limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests conducted in different countries was very contradictory.
These differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be greatly exaggerated.
With a polymeric chain reaction of reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on airway samples obtained in various ways, including a sock swab or a wet sample.
Results are usually available for periods ranging from hours to two days.
The BT-PCR test, which was performed on swabs taken from the throat, is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, but it will continue to reproduce in the lungs.
Infected patients tested in the second week of the disease may, as an alternative, use lower respiratory tract material using a suction catheter, or may use tasting products (modromates).
An early PCR test was developed at Sharite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 sets subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech had developed the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It identifies the "E" gene common to all beta-coronavirus and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group became one of the first companies to have been authorized by the National Drug Administration of China to use the SARS-CoV-2 emergency detection kit based on the PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute through International Regent Resource their diagnostic panel for RT-PCR in real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from the older versions of the test sets produced incomplete results due to defective reagents and a narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta, resulting in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and it was only after that date that public and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Quality Supervision Authority as part of an emergency use permit, and the U.S. Commercial Laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that it was possible to test COVID-19 on the basis of RT-PCR throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing for COVID-19 throughout the country on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been declared; the sampling and processing of the analyses have to be performed in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and carried out by the State Research Centre for Viviology and Biotechnology, WECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service, and it was reported that on March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA for a test that could be performed for 3.5 hours on a large sample volume, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests for 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency application permit (EUA) to Abbot laboratories for Abbot m2000 testing; previously, the FDA issued a similar permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA also approved a test that uses the technique of amplification of insulated nucleic acids instead of the PCR.
Since the test does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, the method can detect positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are now about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day, and Taiwan is currently developing a monoclonal antibodies test that is specifically linked to a new coronavirus (N-protein) nucleocapsis protein, and there is hope that it will be possible to produce results in 15-20 minutes, like flu rapid anti-teaste.
A review of specialized literature in March 2020 concluded that "thorax X-rays have little diagnostic value at an early stage, whereas CT [computer tomography] results may have such value even before symptoms occur".
Typical indicators identified by CT include two-way, multi-directional sub-plerial caps of the "match glass" type with peripheral, asymmetric and aposterior distribution.
Subplevalent domination, the symptom of a boulder bridge and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR and CT techniques used in Ouhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT was much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions were similar to other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19 diagnostics." As of March 2020, CDC recommends using the PCR method for initial screening.
The partial immune response to the infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to carry out population control.
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed at which each system is produced.
The CLT usually uses one peripheral blood sample, although serial samples can also be used to track the immune response.
At PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by punctured skin.
Unlike the PCR methods, the blood extraction phase is not required for testing. On 26 March 2020, FDA identified 29 organizations that have undergone all the necessary registration procedures and are now able to extend their antibodies tests.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA approved only one emergency use permit test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics obtained European permits to use their test sets, which can detect antibodies in IgG and IGA blood samples capable of controlling the virus.
The test capacity is several hundred samples for several hours and therefore the method is much faster than the normal PCR analysis of viral RNA.
The antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection. In early April, Britain discovered that none of the antibodies it had acquired produced satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients suspected of the virus to stay at home: "Apology Officers deliver a sample tube to the patient", the patient spits in, gives back, and receives test results after a while." British NHS announced the launch of its pilot home-based Suspicious Incident Testing Scheme, which eliminates the risk of patients being infected with other patients at clinics, or the need to disinfect the ambulance if it was used to transport the patient. During rapid testing at COVID-19 in suspicious cases, the medical officer takes analysis using all appropriate precautions.
Express testing centres helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than in any other country. On 2 March, in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Doctors stated that it was prepared to conduct some 12,000 tests per day in outpatient settings, and a week earlier they could only do 10,700 tests a week.
If the examination is ordered by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany ' s total test performance is 160,000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, rapid testing was proposed in several major cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that, as of calendar week 12/2020 on SARS-CoV-2, a total of at least 483,295 tests were taken, up to and including the week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent) were positive; researchers at Israel's Technion and Rambam Hospital clinics developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further analyses only if the combined sample showed a positive result. On 5 February 2020, BGI opened a 2,000 square metre temporary laboratory for the detection of emergencies called "Hoo-Jan" (in Chinese or "Fire Eye"), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
The construction of the laboratory was organized by BGI founder Wang Jiang and completed in just five days; the simulations showed that if the laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated pace, the case of Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher, and consequently quarantine costs would have been twice as high.
Huo-Yang's laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai were opened immediately after the opening of the laboratory in Ouhan, a total of 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Open multiplex Origami Assays schemes were released, which can test up to 1,122 patient tests on COVID19 using only 93 test tubes. Such balanced designs can operate in small laboratories, excluding the need to use robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to insufficient and insufficient reagents, mass testing in the EU, the UK, and the United States had become problematic.
As a result, some authors have resorted to test sample processing protocols, which provide for the heating of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the coronavirus test conducted by the United Arab Emirates per capita at present exceeds any other country, and the majority of the population will soon be tested.
This was due to the ability to conduct rapid testing, together with the acquisition of a mass testing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (established from their emergency laboratories Huo-Yang in China).
This laboratory, which has been deployed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of tests of RT-PCR per day and is the world's first laboratory of such magnitude, operating outside China.
Various tests aimed at different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of test kits, which are sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Health and Epidemiological Centers was not available until January 28, resulting in a lack of testing kits in the United States; at the very beginning of the outbreak, China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits, and those countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient sets recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts argue, the widespread availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean Government has worked to provide testing facilities, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programmes as the best way to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increasing demand for testing resulting from the rapid spread of the virus, many private laboratories in the United States, which received hundreds of thousands of test samples, were overloaded and supplies for swabbing and chemical agents were quickly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by the CDC had "failures", and for that reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private test development. Spain purchased test kits from China's Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of using these sets were inaccurate.
The firm explained that faulty sampling or misuse of the kits could cause the results to be inaccurate.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw the inaccurate sets and replace them with other sets, Shenzhen Bioasy. Eighty per cent of the test sets that the Czech Republic had acquired in China had produced incorrect results. The 1.2 million test sets acquired by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovich proposed to dump them in the Danube. Athes Kara, an employee of the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had "high levels of error" and the Ministry "did not use them." Britain purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but declared them unusable in early April 2020.
Quarantine measures for persons whose tests have yielded positive results on SARS-Cov2, as well as monitoring of persons with whom such patients have been in contact, have had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaud, where COVID-19 died for the first time in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing of the total population of about 3,400 at intervals of about 10 days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.
Entry into the settlement was closed and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
In the context of intensive surveillance of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less intense than in other developed countries, and there was no need to impose extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began urging residents to stay home on 28 March, but the schools, which ended on 23 March, opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions have been less aggressive.
A statistical study showed that in countries with more tests than deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries were able to identify more patients with low or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without mass testing resources, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results of COVID-19 tests to one of the 16 WHO testing laboratories for validation testing.
Seven of these 16 test laboratories are located in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
In the next graph, the "% of positive results" column depends on the country-specific testing policy.
A country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher percentage of positive results than a country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of symptoms of the virus, with other equal conditions.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is a hand-cleaning process to remove pollution, fat, microorganisms or other harmful substances.
Regular hand-washing with soap at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted through fecal oral channels.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or common colds, for example, if he touches his eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e. mucous shells) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day, after which the hands should be washed with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned with ash.
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or washing a child who went to the bathroom.
After snorting, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or animal waste.
Hand health is a medical practice associated with medical procedures.
Handwashing before taking medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to clear hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other micro-organisms capable of causing disease) and chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who cook or work in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Handwashing is very good for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
as well as lowering the infant mortality rate at home.
A 2013 study showed that better hand washing could lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by learning simple habits such as hand washing with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular handwashing reminders can reduce diarrhoea by about one third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing low-income regions with clean water.
A 48 per cent reduction in diarrhoea can be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only most effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (DHS) if appropriate habits are developed in every home, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of ARI, is the main cause of death among children under five years of age, which kills about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia in general kill almost 3.5 million children each year.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before food and after toilets, which has become a strong habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce diarrhea deaths by almost half, and mortality from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out through water, sanitation and hygiene (WACH) programmes.
Hand washing also prevents impetigo, a disease that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A slight negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can result in skin drying and, in fact, damage to the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that too frequent hand washing could lead to a razor and skin spin – a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing can also be considered to be a symptom of OCD.
There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (wetting, defecation), after washing the baby's buttocks (change of diapers), before feeding the child, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or bird.
Some other cases in which hands should be washed to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after treatment of cuts or wounds, after sneezing, coughing or snotting, after touching animal wastes or animals, after touching garbage.
In many countries, hand-washing with soap is rather low.
A handwashing study conducted in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7 per cent of families had hand washing with soap is a common practice. A 2014 study found that the highest figure, 97 per cent, was in Saudi Arabia; the United States was in the middle of the list, 77 per cent; China had the lowest rate, 23 per cent; there were currently several methodologies for changing behaviour and developing the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations; in developing countries, group washing of the hands of schoolchildren at the scheduled time of the day was one such methodology that helped teach children to do so.
The Emergency Health Care Programme of the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of large-scale interventions to improve children's health and education.
This national programme is based on deworming, which takes place twice a year, as well as daily hand-washing with soap and daily brushing with fluorine.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from skin cover is more effective if soap or cleaning materials are added to the washing process.
The main action of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and raise its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective means of skin cleaning, as fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollution, are poorly dissolved in water.
Adequate quantities of water, however, contribute to the clean-up process.
Solid soap, due to repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may be found in previous use.
A small amount of research into the skin cover of contaminated hard soap bacteria suggests that there is little likelihood of such exposure, as bacteria are flushed off with foam.
The CDC still argues that "the liquid soap with a hand-doser is the preferred option for hand-washing".
Anti-bacterial soap is actively promoted in health-care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by their nature.
However, anti-bacterial soap contains common anti-bacterial agents, such as triclosane, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to anti-bacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be consistent with those promoted.
In addition to the surface-active substance and skin protection, complex compounds may contain acids (acetic, ascorbine, dairy) as a pH regulator, as well as anti-microbial active benzoic acid and other respirations (alae faith, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health has shown that simple soap varieties are as effective as conventional anti-bacterial soap containing triclosane in preventing disease and removing bacteria from the skin.
Hot water comfortable with human skin still isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria reproduce much faster at a body temperature of 37 °C.
However, to remove natural fats that contain pollution and bacteria, warm soap water is more effective than cold water.
Contrary to popular opinion, scientific research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of the microbial load on the hands.
Hand disinfectant (sanitizer) or hand antiseptic is a hand hygiene device that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based hand hygiene products (also known as hand disinfectants, hand disinfectants or santaisers) became popular.
Most of these products are made of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of musting agents such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel, or humidifiers such as liquid glycerin or foam, which provide comfort in the use of these products and reduce the effects of skin drying with alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases anti-microbial activity; disinfectants with a minimum of 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis stick, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, Rinavirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungus.
Disinfectant containing 70 per cent of alcohol kills 99.97 per cent of bacteria (a 3.5 reduction log is similar to a 35 decibels reduction) on the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99 per cent - 99.999 per cent of bacteria (a 4-5 reduction log) on the hands 1 minute after use. Hand disinfectants are the most effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are virtually ineffective against morovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis; sufficient antiseptics or alcohol must be used to thoroughly treat and lubricate the skin of the hands on both sides.
The face and rear surface of both hands, as well as the space between the fingers throughout the length, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel are completely absorbed.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that we choose hand washing rather than using disinfectant, especially when the hands are heavily contaminated.
The increased popularity of such disinfectants is due to their easy use and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be a substitute for full hand washing if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of hand disinfectants on a alcohol-based basis may cause skin dryness if the composition of the disinfectants does not contain mitigating agents and (or) skin humidifiers.
The effect of drying skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and (or) other mitigating substances to the composition of the means.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants with mitigating components caused much less irritation and skin dryness than soap or anti-microbial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact prune syndrome or hypersensitive to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are almost non-existent.
The lower probability of an annoying contact dermatitis has been a factor in the choice of disinfectant compared to soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free means do not clear their hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand disinfectants are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms as conventional soap and water, as pathogenic microorganisms still remain on hand when using them.
The effectiveness of an inflammatory hand-free agent depends to a large extent on the components and composition and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol.
More recently, it has been shown that preparations using benzalconium chloride have persistent and cumulative anti-microbial activity, as opposed to alcohol, which has been proven to lose efficiency after repeated use, probably due to progressive side-skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ash or clay.
Zola or clay may be more effective than just water, but it will always be less effective than soap.
One of the problems with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated by micro-organisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is an disinfectant, because in contact with water it forms a alkaline solution.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends the use of ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommend the use of hand-washing techniques, which include the following steps:
Pour your hands under warm or cold running water.
It's the running water that is recommended, because standing water can be contaminated, but the temperature of the water doesn't matter.
Wash your hands by rubbing them with a lot of soap, including the back of your palms, as well as areas between your fingers and under your fingernails.
Soap removes microbes from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap (and not just water).
Trite hands for at least 20 seconds.
The friction helps to remove the germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs are removed.
Carefully rinse your hands under the running water.
Stretching hands in standing water can cause re-infection.
Wipe your hands clean with a towel or let them dry themselves.
Wet and moist hands are easier to contaminate, and most often people ignore areas such as thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers and under their fingernails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended that wetting lotion be used to prevent the drying of hands, which may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are inaccessible, there are many different affordable ways to wash hands: pouring water out of a hanging canister or bottled pumpkin with holes and (or) using ash if necessary, such as in developing countries. Water-saving solutions such as foot-ped cranes and other low-cost options exist in places with limited water supply (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries).
A tap with a foot pedal is a simple design consisting of a vessel suspended on a rope and a foot lever that should be pressed to pour water into the hands, and a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand-drying is an integral part of the process of hand hygiene, but there are some debates about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are far more hygienic than electric hand dryers, which are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London carried out a study sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper napkins and Towels, which focused on comparing the hygiene of paper towels, warm air hand dryers and more advanced hand-flower air dryers.
After washing and drying hands in a warm air dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria on the pillows increased by 194% on average and 254% on the palms.
It also found that after washing and drying hands in the airflow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips increased by 42 per cent and on the palms by 15 per cent.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria on the pillows is on average reduced to 76 per cent and on the palms to 77 per cent. Scientists have also conducted tests to determine whether several visitors to the toilets and the toilet environment can cross each type of drying.
A string-air dryer that emits air at the declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph) is capable of defusing microorganisms from the hands and from its own unit and potentially infecting other users of the bathroom and toilet within a radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of warm air hand dryers spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
The use of paper towels did not reveal a significant spread of micro-organisms. In 2005, TøV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to assess various methods of hand-drying.
The following changes are observed in the number of bacteria depending on the method of hand drying:
There are many different hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towels.
Hand cleaning using disinfectant napkins can be an alternative solution during travel without soap or water.
Hand disinfectant on a alcohol-based basis shall contain at least 60 per cent alcohol.
The medical method of washing hands became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignac Zemmelweiss discovered its high effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of inpatient diseases.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget to do so.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps to reduce the level of contamination.
Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and wipe each part of the hand.
Hands should be carefully rubbed against each other by scratching fingers.
If there's dirt under your fingernails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water present on their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
A paper towel should be used after drying the hands, closing the crane and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors.
This avoids the re-polluting of hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their spread.
New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most health facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before they touch patients and thus spread micro-organisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the rate of blood flow infections associated with the use of catheter by 66 per cent, and the World Health Organization has published a leaflet depicting the standard hand-washing and hand-processing procedure to be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO manual on hand health is also available on its website and is open for public discussion.
The review was co-sponsored by Whitby.
Commercial devices can be used to measure performance and verify hand hygiene if regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization refers to "five points" when washing hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before the use of anti-septics, and
Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap in hand washing (medical or anti-microbial soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such anti-bacterial properties may be necessary prior to surgery or in an environment with high levels of antibiotic-resistant organisms; "cleaning" of hands prior to surgery requires a crane that can be turned on and off without touching its hands; and a little chlor-hexadin or iodized water should be used for hand polishing, sterile hand-drying after washing, a sterile friction brush and another sterile tool for fingernail cleaning.
All ornaments must be removed.
This procedure requires hand wash and ulna, usually for two to six minutes.
You don't have to rub your hands for too long, like 10 minutes.
During stripping, the water with the shoulder shall not fall back on the wrists of the hands.
After washing, the hands will dry with sterile cloth and put on a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash hands or use antiseptics before and after taking care of a sick person.
To combat staph infection in hospitals, the first 20 per cent of washing was found to be the most useful for washing hands, and very few additional benefits were obtained when the hand washing rate was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared to washing anti-bacterial soap, washing hands with conventional soap results in more than three times the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. Comparison of hand washing with alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with anti-bacterial soap, on average 30 seconds per procedure, showed that the treatment of hands with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to anti-bacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand-based alcohol solutions in reducing the amount of influenza A H1N1 and the Clostridium dispute. Hand hygiene in health facilities may include training of personnel in hand washing, improving the availability of hand-based alcohol, and providing written and oral reminders to staff on the need to wash their hands.
Further research is needed on the most effective interventions in various health facilities.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered to be an economically efficient and important means of improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water supply, soap, or handwashing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to inculcate the habit of regularly washing hands.
For example, most rural areas in Africa do not have hand-washing cranes in every private or public toilet, although there are cheap ways to organize hand-washing in such places.
However, poor hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Promotion and encouragement of hand-washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term changes in public behaviour.
Monitoring and evaluation of results are needed to ensure the effectiveness of such measures.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that community-based health surveillance was effective in lower middle-income countries, while public marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of advocacy for hand washing in schools was the United Nations Children's Fund's Three Star Approach approach: it promoted simple, cost-effective school measures to encourage students to wash their hands using soap, as well as other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring that minimum standards are met, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
The installation of handholds is one of the possible measures implemented through hand health information campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
Global Handwashing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at behavioural change, and as a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund is promoting the use of hand washing emosis.
Some studies examined the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to DALYs (saved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that the incentive to wash hands with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for vulnerable groups such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and the "founder of modern care".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotten smells called miasmas.
In the 1980s, as a result of outbreaks of diseases spreading through the digestive tract and diseases associated with medical care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States became more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with "right handwashing techniques" were displayed in public toilets as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase "to wash your hands" means expressing its reluctance to accept responsibility for or to participate in anything.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate "washed his hands " when deciding on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; it was later used more widely in some English communities.
In the play "Macbeth" Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands inadvertently in an attempt to cleanse herself of an imaginary stain symbolizing an unclean conscience for the crimes she committed herself and prompted her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who remember or observe an unethical act tend to wash their hands more often than others, and that their hands are more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have had the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing them will participate in any other "cleaning" compensatory activities, such as volunteering.
In religions, hand washing has both a religious purpose and a symbolic meaning: the symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap, is part of a ritual in many religions, including Baha ' i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat Yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam, and the religions also prescribe a hygienic washing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe compulsory hand washing after going to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash your hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors related to COVID-19
Control of production factors in relation to COVID-19 involves the application of occupational safety and health protection techniques to control risk and control the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper monitoring of workplace risks depends on the location and task, is based on risk assessment, the severity of the epidemic in the community and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Authority (OSHA) reported that less-at-risk posts had minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures were required to combat infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home on the grounds of illness, observance of respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium-risk jobs require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 but are likely to be infected due to the current spread of the disease within the community or on international travel.
This category may include workers in contact with the public, for example in schools, working environments with high population density and some large retail stores.
The risk control measures for such a group, in addition to the basic prevention measures, include air-cooling using high-efficiency air filters, the use of shielding and accessible personal protective equipment in the event of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that medical and morgue personnel who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are at high risk, with the risk increasing to a very high level when such personnel conduct aerosol procedures or collect/process samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such staff include the use of engineering safety equipment such as negative-pressure ventilation rooms and personal protection equipment suitable for the task.
The COVID-19 outbreak may have various effects at the workplace.
Workers may be absent from the workplace because of their own illness, the need to care for others or the fear of possible contamination.
Commercial templates may change both for the types of goods that are in demand and for the manner in which such goods are purchased (e.g. buying in non-peak periods with delivery or maintenance without leaving the machine).
Finally, there may be interruptions in the delivery of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The plan for preparedness for and response to the epidemic can be used in the organization of protection.
The plans address the risks associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors occurring at home and in communities, and risk factors of individual workers, such as old age or chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the controls needed to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
The epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the objectives of responding to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintain business operations and minimize negative impacts on other organizations in their supply chains.
The response is influenced by the severity of the disease in the business community.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group them according to their effectiveness.
If it is not possible to eliminate the risk of disease, COVID-19 is the most effective engineering safety means, then administrative measures, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering security means separating staff from work-related risk locations and does not rely on the behaviour of the employee, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in working policies or procedures requiring action by an employee or employee.
Personal protection equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help to address certain risks.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected according to the threat to the employee, be of a size (e.g. respirators), be used continuously and properly, regularly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, and be properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of in order to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Authority (OSHA) believes that posts have minimal exposure to the public and their colleagues.
Basic responses to the epidemic, recommended for all workplaces, include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with respiratory etiquette, including the closing of their mouths during coughing and sneezing, provision of napkins and garbage containers, readiness for remote or shift work, if necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of those potentially infected is a critical step for the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that staff members with symptoms of acute respiratory diseases remain at home until the heat is stopped, the body temperature is not high and many other symptoms are free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever control or other medications to eliminate symptoms, and that staff members be allowed to stay at home to care for a sick family member and be aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed evidence or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a risk of SARS-COV-2 infection due to the spread of the disease in the society in the territory where the business is located or the recent travel of such a person to COVID-19 distribution sites.
These categories include workers who have been in contact with the public, for example in schools, working environments with high population densities and some large retail stores; safety engineering tools for such groups and groups at higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation intensity, physical barriers such as transparent plastic shielding, and the installation of customer service windows without leaving the vehicle; administrative measures for such a group and groups at higher risk include recommendations for sick workers to remain at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, setting replacement schedules, stopping non-critical visits to COVID-19 distribution sites, developing emergency communication plans, including a forum for responding to concerns, providing up-to-date training for workers on COVID-19 risk factors and protection measures, training workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, proper use of such equipment, provision of resources and a working environment conducive to personal hygiene, requirement for regular hand washing, restriction of access to the workplace by customers and the public, placing of information signs on hand washing and other protective measures against COVID-19 risk, training of workers for proper use of such devices, provision of resources and a working environment that is necessary for workers at a lower risk than a working person.
In rare cases, workers from such a risk group may be required to wear respirators.
If a person is sick in a plane, measures are required to ensure the proper safety of workers and other passengers, such as the isolation of the sick person from other persons for a distance of 6 feet, the appointment of a crew member to care for the sick person, the provision of a mask to the sick person, or the request to such a person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin in case of coughing or sneezing.
Secondary crew members shall wear one-time medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller or in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protection if the patient has a fever, regular cough or respiratory difficulty.
The used gloves and other non-refillable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag and the contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected.In commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, safety measures include delay in the event of illness, self-insulation and immediate information to the ship ' s health centre in the event of heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should be carried out in an isolated person ' s quarters; in the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfecting if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or average rate of infection in the community, social distance strategies may be introduced, such as the cancellation of personal visits, meetings and other mass events, such as physical education or choir singing, eating in cafeteria, the extension of the distance between desks, the adjustment of arrival and departure times, the restriction of non-existent visits, and the use of a separate location of health facilities for children with influenza symptoms.
In addition to social distance strategies, long-term non-attendance measures may be considered at a significant rate in the local community; for law enforcement officers performing daily duties, the immediate risk to health is considered low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are encouraged to follow the same instructions as ambulance nurses, including the use of suitable personal protective equipment.
When in close contact during detention, employees are required to clean and disinfect their formal belts and equipment before reuse by household cleaning aerosols or by rubbing, to comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and the disposal of personal protective equipment used, as well as the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA believes that certain categories of health and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical, support, laboratory and transport staff who contact patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of contamination in aerosol procedures or in collecting/processing samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 contamination.
Aerosol procedures include sounding, coughing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and testing or invasive sampling.
High-risk morgue workers include those who process the bodies of people who are confirmed to be or suspected of contracting COVID-19 at the time of their death; if they perform an autopsy, they are placed in a very high-risk category; additional engineering and safety facilities for such risk groups include the use of isolated rooms for patients who are confirmed to have a disease or suspicion of COVID-19, including procedures associated with the formation of aerosols.
In some health facilities and morgues, special ventilation with negative pressure may be an effective measure.
Samples should be treated in accordance with the precautionary measures for level 3 biosecurity.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients be allocated to separate waiting areas, depending on whether they are suspected of contracting COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers who interact up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-COV-2 infection, as well as those who conduct procedures with aerosol formation.
In the U.S., approved NOSH respirators for a person with a N95 filter or higher must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection programme that specifies individual selection requirements and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort to the staff member. WHO does not recommend the use of special clothing, as COVID-19 is a disease transmitted respiratoryly rather than through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for staff performing screening at the patient reception point.
WHO recommends that those collecting respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19 or vectors without procedures accompanied by aerosols wear a surgical mask, protective glasses or face shield, robe and gloves.
When procedures are carried out with the formation of aerosols, the surgical mask shall be replaced by a respirator N95 or FFP2.
In view of the lack of personal protective equipment worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protective equipment through the use of remote medicine, physical barriers, such transparent windows, access to patients infected with COVID-19 only for those who provide direct care, the use of only personal protective equipment required for a specific task, the prolonged use of the same respiratory device without removing, with multiple patients with the same diagnosis, the monitoring and coordination of the personal protection supply chain and the recommendation not to use masks for those without symptoms.

TOMA: [Covid-19] Load relief and preparation for the future
DATE/WIDE MANAGEMENT: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
AUTHORIZATION: CC0: No protected rights
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that has shed light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the ability to empathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the core of such an organization.
We have seen a friendly and caring relationship among all our colleagues, as reflected in e-mails, calls, and chat rooms — a remarkable confirmation of the fact that fortunately amazing people are working with us.
I speak with great gratitude and pride of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of our high appreciation for our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to turn to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And that's possible because of your work, whether it's to make websites work, pay our colleagues or protect community safety.
The world needs the information presented in Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever before.
At such a time, not only what we do but also how we do it is important to achieve meaningful results for peace.
In view of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustment of our work and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.
In our communication, we considered our ideas on how best to deal with the current situation and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization at such a time.
The vast majority of us wanted to ease the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back off, let it be so.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff personnel:
According to our expectations, it will take about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further orders are issued.
We don't announce weekends: if you can work more hours normally, this is allowed for our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs are, whether you care for your family, buy food or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority number one.
We don't keep track of your working time.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
That is understandable and undeniable, but we mention it.
No sick leave or leave is required: just inform your supervisor and help the team to revise the calendar and schedule to cover key areas.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, inform Brian at T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and due attention from management to your situation.)
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and reaffirmed our intention to honour our obligations to our contractors and to our staff at an hourly rate.
Each person will be paid according to the normal hourly rates applicable under normal circumstances.
This implies, in particular, periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.
What we are doing can yield remarkable results, especially in times like these.
Again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
Such activities must always be supported.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundrazing teams, among others, perform critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and shift the focus to providing support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we're just focusing on the most important projects.
Slowness today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work twice as hard to catch up with after the pandemic.
You don't need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the present.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and will work towards setting new targets and timetables, if possible.
What happens to APP (annual plans)?
In order to adapt ourselves to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the time frame for the implementation of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to propose an extension of the time frame for our 2019-2020 plan, thus allowing more time for budgeting, allowing staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care, with a reduced schedule for the next few weeks for all who need or want to work.
This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions throughout the organization.
Next week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, to inform representatives and teams of relevant information on the next steps as soon as we receive confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for taking the lead in this work.
Office condition, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected with COVID-19.
However, apart from a lot of precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used medical-class antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception halls and elevator halls through which access to our floor could be made possible.
The building has its own rules requiring caution, using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in D.C. is located on WeWork's network, which shared its COVID-19 rules with us and all DC staff.
Last week, our office in D.C. completely moved to remote work, in accordance with instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the issue of renting premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions are continuing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues, working remotely, are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If there is a need for longer sessions, consider the possibility of dividing them into a course consisting of several days.
Clearly define the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send the material in advance.
By default, use video communications to facilitate interaction and communication using tools such as GoogleDocs and Zoom.
For ease of reference, appoint a focal point — a person who will monitor the questions in the chat room and supervise the list of speakers, as well as a record keeper (or joint check-up).
If appropriate, contact the help desk by e-mail.
Take advantage of Wellness Reimbursement when you buy appetizers.
Connect to the #remotes channel at Slack to talk to colleagues about the distributed work.
HR Operations is studying ergonomics manuals available in webinar format to facilitate the efficiency of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grantees to cancel mass activities funded by Wikimedia, such as "editathons", until the end of the pandemic is announced by WHO.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the inability to carry out agreed grant activities, and no one will be fined for any delay or change in such objectives.
In the coming week, we will conduct follow-up activities with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general feeling in the global community is not only a disappointment at the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief in terms of mutual understanding and the ability to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia, and not only.
In terms of perspective, CRT is working on a page at Meta-Wiki that will provide space for the community to monitor exposure and communication.
We remain in contact on COVID-19 issues.
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 2:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we will take the opportunity to further share relevant information, answer your questions and spend time with each other.
We're in this situation together, and we're ready to help whatever we can.
In doing so, you can continue to receive information from such e-mails and other important information on COVID-19 from Office Wiki.
The CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been greatly affected by the current situation.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key workflow, reporting problems or other assistance, contact CRT.
We stand ready to provide support and communications as necessary.
If there are confidentiality problems, contact Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations, by e-mail.
No such change should be seen as a renunciation of our work and our commitments.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a fundamentally new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to enable us to continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the right service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support each other and to create space for the important work to be done in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
For this to happen, we will need the help of each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, as well as to work with maximum efficiency as soon as such a need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Jane U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-translation enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface(s) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of angiotensin-transverse enzyme (ACE) by reducing angiotenzin II and increasing Ang (1-7) by making it a promising solution for cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as the entry point for some coronavirus cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal farm located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-consequent Peptidase Domain M2 and the C-consequent Transport Domain of the Renal Amino Acid Collection.
ACE2 is a type I single-way membrane protein, and its enzyme active domain reaches the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
ACE2's subcellular domain is split from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as the mesh, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually released with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most light-type alveolar cells, entherocytes of the fine intestine, arterial and venetic endothelial cells, and cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
ACE2 biosynthesis is also found in the cortex of the brain, the stem, the hypothalamus, and the stem of the brain.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
The ACE splits the hormone angiotensin I into a vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, splits the carboxyl end amino acid phenylalanin from angiotenzin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into a vasodilatator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break up a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of SLC6A19 neutral amino acids and is present during Hartnup's illness.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for some coronavirus, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-Cov (SARS) virus; and SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
Strictly speaking, linking S1 Spike SARS-Cov and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and the translocation of both virus and enzyme into endosomas within cells.
This process of entry also requires the numbering of S protein with a TMPRSS2 serin protein, whose inhibition is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic device, which has led some to believe that lowering ACE2 levels in cells can help combat infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend the continuation of standard therapy by APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, "the use of AFP inhibitors was associated with a significant 34 per cent reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group".
Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced for patients who have received AFP inhibitors, who have been at higher risk by contracting pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of AFP inhibitors was also associated with the reduction of pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than those of patients with overall pneumonia risk."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is believed to be an innovation in treatment for acute lung damage and appears to improve pulmonary hemodomamics and oxygen saturation in humans will grow with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolisacharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the beginning of operation is 30 minutes, in addition to 24 hours.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people who are not exposed to classical inhibitors of retinin- angiotensin (RAS) or diseases that increase the circulation of angiotensin II. The introduced rhACE2 has been assessed in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist the epidemiological investigation of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of persons ("comacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many applications officially supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.
Several versions of the contact tracking applications have been developed.
This led to a discussion on confidentiality issues, especially with regard to systems based on tracking the geographical location of applications.
Softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate Bluetooth support into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipay, launched an app that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and Singapore uses an app called TrackTogether.
The application has been developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be placed under government control. Northern Macedonia has launched the "StopKorona!" app, which works on Bluetooth, helps track contact with potentially infected people and provides operational communication with health authorities.
The annex was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting registration with Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking application was in the final stages of development and would be available for deployment for several weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering using applications based on Singapore's TransTogether application and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an application with a geozonation function to ensure that patients with COVID-19 diagnosis in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security, Cambridge University, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise with application-based systems, including false reactions and potential inefficiency if only a small part of the population uses the application.
Given concerns about the proliferation of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the range of types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus applications to the App Store to include only "official" or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon also introduced similar restrictions.
The privacy campaign expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus applications; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure established to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the restriction of this type of supervision.
The organizations have declared eight conditions for public projects:
Monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
The expansion of monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by limitation clauses;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19 control purposes;
Data security and anonymity should be protected and evidence of such security should be provided;
Digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be determined by law;
Protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuses should be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Bourders (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple offer their joint plan to address the problem of ongoing monitoring, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as the need for it is no longer necessary.
In some countries, the application is replaced by a web-based tracking of the location, thus eliminating the need for downloading the application and the possibility of avoiding tracking.
In Israel, online tracking was approved.
Network solutions that have access to baseline location data also have large potential confidentiality problems.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of confidential systems have been developed that use central servers for communications only (see section below).
In South Korea, a system was used to track contacts that did not use the applications as a basis.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracing information from various sources, including mobile tracking and card transactions, and then combined them to create text messages that were sent to potentially infected individuals.
The Government not only used this information to alert citizens to potential contact with infected persons, but also made the information available to the public, which was made possible by the significant changes in information protection legislation that had been introduced since the outbreak of MERs in that country.
This information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites, and countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized and confidential systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details had not yet been made public.
As of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups were working on confidentiality solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the user ' s approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized confidential transmission (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Connect EventNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mobile tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all comparisons take place on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures confidentiality in the collection and use of location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The platform's work is based on studies in "Apps Goone Rogue: Managing Personal PRIVACE in an Epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a confidentiality technology company that was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware to enable users to share confidential location and state of health data with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of the data.
On 5 April 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols were formed by the TCN Global Coalition, which aims to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of tracking and alert applications, which is a key factor in their wide dissemination.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that would preserve confidentiality.
They also published the technical specifications of the main technologies used in the operation of the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
Deployment of tools to enable Governments to establish official applications to track the movement of persons infected with the coronavirus, but with data confidentiality
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve constant surveillance problems by first implementing the system by updating the operating system and then removing it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
Repositioning of a drug (also known as reprofiling, rerouting, changing tasks or therapeutic diversion) is the reprofiling of an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or a medical condition other than that originally envisaged for development.
This is an area of research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research areas include the development of a vaccine for COVID-19 and the transfusion of reoccupying plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-exposed proteins, each of which has several liganda binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are Papaine Protease, RNA-dependent RNA Polimerase, Helicas, S protein, and ADF-risphosphateasis.
Hussein AA and the co-authors in their pre-clining study examined several candidate compounds, which were then optimized, and analysed their similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a highly effective anti-SARS-COV-2 drug to be recommended for clinical research.
Chlorochine is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the "Solidarity" clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that the tests of chloroform and hydroxychloroquine would begin in New York State on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychlorochin sulfate and chlorochine phosphate in accordance with the Emergency Use Permit (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA clinical trials and is only allowed under EUA as an experimental emergency treatment for patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under clinical trials.
The CDC stated that "the order of use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" had not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when there's no other way out.
The Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloro-chin in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is being carried out at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University School of Medicine in Lagon examines the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychlorochin.
China's clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that the favipiravire is "unmistakably effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen who took the drug received an average negative result after four days, while 45 patients who did not take the drug had an average duration of 11 days.
A study was conducted in Ouhan, where 240 patients with pneumonia were observed, one half of whom received faviravivir and the other half were umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical authority reminded the public that the results of the drug ' s effectiveness were scarce and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase a drug in Japan to replenish its stocks, and that military resources would be used to transport it to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe informed the Trump administration about the possibility of purchasing a drug, which could be less effective in neglected cases.
It may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for those who try to get pregnant.
A study on the combination of antivirals "polinavire" and "tritonavire" (Kaletra) concluded that "no effective use of drugs has been identified".
The drugs were designed to inject HIV replication by linking it to the proteasia.
A group of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a connection that will connect to the SARS-Cov-2 protein. The scientific community criticizes the reprofiling of drugs that were specifically designed for HIV and AIDS therapy.
WHO has included a combination of lopinavire and ritonavire in the international test of Solidarity.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections, and later Gilead Sciences found that the remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple philo-, pneumo-, paramixo- and coronavirus.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that remdesivir can have a high genetic barrier to resistance; several clinical trials are under way, including two at Cleveland University Clinics; one on moderate patients and the other on patients with more severe forms of disease.
There are currently three clinical tests for vitamin C ingestion for people who are hospitalized with a severe form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, testing of azithromicin antibiotics began in the state of New York.
The Japanese National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to conduct a clinical study of Alvesco (cyclosonia) of Teijin, an inhalation corticostester for asthma treatment, for use in the treatment of presymptom patients infected with the new coronavirus.
The phase II test, the form of angiotensin-translation enzyme 2, is carried out with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of illness to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colicin in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with weak COVID-19 symptoms.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and over were invited, who were diagnosed with COVID-19, with mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breast-feeding and women who do not use effective contraception cannot participate in the study.
In Italy, there are several coaguliants on trial.
The use of non-commolecular heparin for treatment of patients is widespread, which has prompted the Italian Drug Authority to publish recommendations for the use of this drug.
A multi-centre study involving 300 patients was announced in Italy on 14 April to study the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the reprofiling of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics, such as MERS, SARS and the Western Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Recommendations.
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of China ' s recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been found to be potentially suitable for use as treatment for COVID-19:
Tocilysumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also tests in Italy and China, see Tocilitumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has passed clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to be available earlier than 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing phase I security studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-COV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine initiative are to provide the required speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were under study and development to produce an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in phase I security studies are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate drug: Moderna, IRNC-1273)
virus vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate drug: CanSino Biologics, Type 5 adenovyrus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are being used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 additional candidate vaccines have been announced, but there is little publicly available information (presumably in the planning or development phase).
Stages I to II are pre-tested for safety and immunogenicity, generally re-dominated, placebo-controlled and in several locations, while defining more precise and effective doses.
Phase III of the test usually involves more participants, including the control group; at this stage, the drugs are tested for disease prevention effectiveness and at the same time the side effects are monitored at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested (still in the pre-clinological phase).
On January 24, 2020, Queensland University, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular clamped vaccine that genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
On 24 January 2020, the International Centre for Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) of Saskatchewan University, Canada, announced the launch of its own vaccine to begin human testing in 2021.
Vaccination projects were also launched at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen's pharmaceutical companies, led by Hanneka Shuitmaker, announced the beginning of work on the development of their vaccine.

On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Welfare Command, Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute, Silver Spring, located in the western part of Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that she had entered into a partnership with Novax Inc.
to develop and produce a vaccine.
Partners have also announced plans for pre-clining and stage I clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that even with accelerated treatment, it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop the vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company, Quebec, reported that they had created a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
A potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory research, and testing in humans is planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "greater sums of money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, to which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an IRNA vaccine.
BNT162 is an IRNA vaccine candidate; the drug is currently undergoing pre-clining tests and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, the Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that it would receive the results of pre-clining tests in April 2020, and their final vaccine candidate drug could begin to be tested on humans in the fall.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Pandemic Preparedness (CEPI), France, announced that $4.9 million would be invested in the COVID-19 vaccine consortium with the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and Pittsburgh University, with a total CEPI investment of $29 million in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine.
Other investment partners of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
The Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-improving COVID-19 RNA vaccine.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of a sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of 275 million Canadian dollars to fund 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
Around the same time, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of $192 million specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans to establish a national vaccine bank, which would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new outbreak of coronavirus.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported testing of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 on mice, stating that "MNA injected sub-unitial SARS-COV-2 S1 vaccines, causing strong responses to antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] that appeared two weeks after immunization".
On April 16, 2020, the Canadian Pharmaceutical School of Waterloo University announced the development of a potential vaccine based on DNA, which may be produced in the form of nasal spray.
With bacteria, DNA will reproduce within human bacteria and produce harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-COV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities combined IBM supercomputer resources with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud computing resources.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages besides disease prevention.
Another randomized study in Australia covers 4,170 health workers.
The vaccines being developed may prove unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies to assess the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, point to the need for measures to contain biosecurity 3 infection in the treatment of living viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
The vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines for SARS treatment that are safe and effective for people.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARD has been a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world, and there is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS began to spread, it was thought that the SARS study that had been conducted at that time could become the standard for developing vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-COV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (based on DNA) vaccine from MERS, which had undergone stage I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were virus-based vaccines and were in the process of being developed, two of which were adenovirus vaccines (Chadox1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one of which were MVA-MERS-S.
There was a conspiracy theory on social media that claimed that the COVID-19 virus was not new and that the vaccine already existed.
Publications on social media quoted some patients who claimed to have patents on the genetic sequence of other strains of coronavirus, such as SARS, as well as vaccines for these strains.
The coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing and respiratory difficulty.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The period from the first symptom to peak is usually about five days, but may also range from two to fourteen days.
Most cases consist of mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease is transmitted to viral pneumonia and organ failure.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people had died from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus mainly spreads when people are in close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops that are released into the air when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although these drops are formed by exhalation, they are usually a threat to land or surface, but are not transmitted through long-range air.
People are also infected by touching the contaminated surface and then by their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is the most contagious during the first three days after the symptoms appear, although its distribution may be possible both before the symptoms appear and at later stages; the standard diagnostic method is a polymeric chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a swab from a sock.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients suspected of being ill and to those who care for them.
The recommendations on the use of health masks by the population differ: some agencies recommend that they not be used at all, some recommend their use and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19 virus.
Local prevalence was recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or influenza symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue and breathing.
Emergency symptoms include breathing difficulties, constant pain or feeling of chest depression, confusion, wake-up difficulties, death of face or lips; if the symptoms mentioned above are present, medical attention should be sought immediately.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, sniffing, or throat pain, may be more likely to occur.
Also, in various percentages there are gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea.
Some of the cases reported in China were initially only shown by a feeling of contraction in the chest and increased heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease may progress into pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and eventually death occurs.
It's called an incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of people have symptoms within 11.5 days of infection; according to available data, the symptoms do not occur in all infected persons.
The role of such impotent carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of infected people with unstimulated disease is currently unknown and is only being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KDCC) reported that in 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus, the course of the disease was impotent.
China ' s National Health Commission began to include non-imptomy cases in its daily report on 1 April; of the 166 cases reported on that day, 130 (78 per cent) refused to be non-imptom at the time of testing.
Both wet and saliva can have a large concentration of the virus.
When speaking loudly, more drops are released into the air than when speaking loudly.
A study in Singapore showed that with open cough, drops can spread up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
The virus is not generally transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has assumed that bio-aerosol transmission of virus particles is still possible, and testing of air treated by air collectors located in corridors outside human rooms has revealed the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (HRM), may lead to the spraying of exhalation products and therefore to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through feces, but the risk is considered low; the virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible before symptoms occur, but the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claims that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects two or three others; the virus is able to survive on the surface from a few hours to a few days.
In particular, it was found that on the cardboard surface the virus could live for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99 per cent of copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These figures, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and cleaning agents, if properly used, have a rather useful effect in controlling contamination: soap destroys the fatty protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and can eliminate it from the surface of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconichloride and chlorhexidin gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective against the virus; in a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient the highest level of the virus in the blood was detected on the second day of testing.
Heavy acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome first found in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Ouhan.
All signs of the new SARS-Cov2 virus are also found in the natural coronavirus.
While outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a household soap that opens its protective shell.
The lungs are the most exposed organ to COVID-19, as the virus enters the host cells through angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II alveolar cells.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell by means of a characteristic surface glycoroteine, a "heep" (peplomer).
Twelve per cent of infected people admitted to the hospital in Ouhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common when the disease is severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammation and immune system disorders observed during the progress of the disease, but acute myocardial damage can also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities because they participate in the work of this organ.
The high frequency of thrombosis (31 per cent) and venous thromboembol (25 per cent) was observed in patients with COVID-19 at the ITD and could indicate adverse predictions. The autopsy of patients who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and lymphocytocytoic infiltrates in their lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropical effect on ACE2-expressive epithelial respiratory cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF T-cells were found to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes from IL-6 and severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
The autopsy also revealed lymphocytic infiltrations.
WHO has also published several test protocols for this disease.
The real-time polar chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test shall normally be carried out on respiratory samples obtained from the nose-swallow swab, but a nose or wet swab sample may also be used.
Results are usually available for periods ranging from hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be performed, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have managed to separate the strain of the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can develop the polymeric chain reaction (PCR) tests themselves to detect the presence of the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibodies tests that could detect current infection as well as possible infection in the past were under development but not yet widely available.
China ' s experience with the results of these tests has shown that they are only 60 to 70 per cent accurate.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Quality Authority (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, allowing it to be applied at the end of this month, and the diagnostic guidelines issued by Junnan Hospital of the University of Wuhan indicate how to detect infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral, multi-directional sub-plviral capacitors of the "maternal glass" type with peripheral, asymmetric and aposterior distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subplelative domination, a symptom of a boulder bridge (long thickening of a partition with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
Little data is available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological postmortem study are:
Macroscopics: pulmonary, pericarditis, compaction and pulmonary swelling
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
slight form of pneumonia: pulmonary swelling, hyperplasia of pneumonia, large atypical pneumonias, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multi-nuclear giant cells
A severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar extrusat.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory stress syndrome (RDDD) and heavy hypoxemia.
Pneumonia healing: organization of alveoliar exhumes and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: Diffuse intravascular reduction (DVS-synd); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with respiratory hygiene, and avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inside of the arm ulna.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended that a good hygiene procedure be carried out for the hands.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue facial masks in public places, in particular with a view to limiting the transmission of infection by persons with unimputed disease; social distance strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have closed schools and businesses, restricted the movement of citizens and eliminated major public events.
The distance guidance also implies that people must be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no drugs with proven efficacy against COVID-19. Since the vaccine is not expected to be completed before 2021, most of the anti-COVID-19 measures are aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the Plateau release.
The CDC also recommends more often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are heavily contaminated, and before and after snotting, coughing or sneezing.
CDC also recommends the use of disinfectant alcohol (the alcohol content is at least 60 per cent) for hand treatment, but only when soap and water are not available. WHO provides two recipes for local production to regions where such disinfectant is not sold.
These formulations use ethanol or isopropanol with anti-microbial activity.
Hydrogen oxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not an appropriate tool for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vitally affected organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect that the virus is infected wear a normal medical mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxidation (ECOM) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being explored.
Respect for personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diet are recommended to strengthen immunity.
Supportive therapy can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care doctors and pulmonologists compiled the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource, IBC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
In order to treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health workers recommend choosing paracetamol (acetaminofene) over ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health facilities, when performing procedures in which air-campus emissions, such as intubation or hand-drying, may occur.
The CDC recommends that health care providers with COVID-19 should be placed in the AIIR, an additional measure beyond standard contact and air precautions. CDC has published recommendations on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during a pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves; of the above, it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
The N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with the Emergency Use Permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but, when not instructed, the effectiveness of protecting against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of protective facial shields or, as a last resort, make masks on their own in the home environment.
In most cases, the forms of COVID-19 flow are not heavy enough to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or their alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is currently under active study and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided by means of a nasal oxygen canyon with intensive airflow or two-level positive respiratory pressure.
It is not yet known whether either of these two methods for patients in critical condition is as effective as the EPI.
Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical lung ventilation, if available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in air compared to the high-flow nasal canal, and the risk of a severe form of disease for older persons (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries, there is a shortage of hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in a severe form requiring hospitalization.
According to one study conducted in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive care, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for lung ventilation and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 per cent of the people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in resuscitation.
The task of providing artificial ventilating to the lungs is complicated as acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) developed at COVID-19 and oxygenation is increasingly problematic.
Inhaled pressure PVC and PRTC are necessary to deliver maximum oxygen to the lungs and to ensure that they are minimally damaged by ventilation that can develop pneumothorax.
In earlier fan models, high LRTCs may not be available.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antivirals are currently in clinical trial.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of illness.
The WHO-recommended volunteers are involved in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary permission to use reconcentrated plasma as a pilot treatment in cases where a person ' s life is in serious or imminent danger.
It has not been subjected to clinical research, which must be carried out to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application designed to control the outbreak.
To enter, users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect "close contact" with observational data and therefore determine the potential risk of contamination.
Each user may also check the status of the other three users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notice to local health authorities. Big data analysis collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and persons they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized security authorities to track the data of mobile phones of people allegedly infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to study and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, German federal government agencies and the Robert Koch Institute provided aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology has been introduced to detect quarantine offenders.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said that cellular network operators reported that "40 per cent of people still move around the territory".
The Government of Germany held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kalylaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor's words: "Intensified social exclusion, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harm to the mental health and well-being of people".
The disease can occur lightly with slight or absent symptoms similar to other common upper respiratory tract diseases, such as common colds.
Patients with mild forms of illness generally recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may require three to six weeks to be treated.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of obtaining a severe form of COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although such data are not available for COVID-19. Some people may have lungs and pneumonia as a complication.
In the case of persons with the most severe condition, COVID-19 may rapidly progress into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, septic shock or polyorganic deficiency.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombobation, and heart, kidney and liver problems.
The abnormalities of thrombobation, especially the increase in protrombin time, were described in 6 per cent of patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, while the kidney function is observed in 4 per cent of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to intensive care was seven days.
Early disease studies indicate that the average time from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), male mortality was 2.8 per cent and female mortality was 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological studies of postmortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromixoid esoids in both lungs.
Pneumocytes observed viral cytopatic changes.
The appearance of the lung was similar to the acute respiratory syndrome (SRDD).
In 11.8 per cent of deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems consisted of raising the level of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had prior health problems; access to health resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality by state vary due to such regional differences as well as methodological difficulties.
A lack of effective calculation of cases in a light form may lead to an overestimation of the mortality rate.
Nevertheless, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
The severe symptoms of COVID-19 were generally 1.4 times more frequent for smokers, and they were approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive treatment or die than non-smokers, and concerns were expressed about the long-term effects of the disease.
One of the clinics in Hong Kong found that some patients recovering from the disease had reduced lung volume by 20-30 per cent, and their scans revealed injuries.
After recovery, it can also lead to a post-intensive therapy syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients recovering from the virus were developing a permanent immunity against it.
According to the current of other coronavirus, this is considered likely, but there have also been reported cases where the coronavirus tests were still positive after recovery from COVID-19.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been an increased long-term disease rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural, animal-born and infectious.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the virus was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet calls 1 December 2019 the earliest date for the first case.
According to official figures published by WHO, the date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary from region to region and time, and are also influenced by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment patterns used, the time since the outbreak of the disease, and population parameters such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 emergency codes: U07.1 for deaths from laboratory confirmed infection SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ratio of deaths to infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a certain period of time.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191).
This figure varies from region to region. Some other methods include the definition of the disease-related mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease, and the determination of the disease-borne mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of a certain segment of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced in all patients who have been infected, the presence of such antibodies makes it clear how many people have been infected.
At the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castillon d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 people (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the town of Gangelt, the disease spread during the carnival celebrations to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths could be officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies, based on donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates vary between men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher among men.
The group most at risk is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women has been narrowing only since the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this discrepancy are not known, but may consist of genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower rates of smoking among women, associated diseases among men (e.g. hypertension among men at a younger age than women) may cause higher male mortality.
In Europe, 57 per cent of infected persons were men, and 72 per cent of deaths from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not maintain gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and DIS, have different gender statistics.
The majority of health-care workers, especially nurses, are women, who are therefore more likely to become infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared the disease COVID-19.
The head of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom Gebreiss, explains: "CO" means "corona", "VI" means "virus", "D" means "disease", and 19 means the year when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid links to a particular geographical location (e.g. China), species of animals or groups of people, as required by the international name recommendations aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
In public communications, WHO uses in addition the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus".
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Ouhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Hunk coronavirus".
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in disease and virus names, WHO recommended the use of the terms "high respiratory disease 2019-nCov" and "2019-nCov" as temporary names for the virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020, the official titles "COVID-19" and "SARS-COV-2" were published.
Owing to limitations on standard supply chains, some digital service producers print medical materials such as nose swab tampons, as well as parts of the EPI machines.
In one such case, the Italian clinic was in urgent need of a ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time frame, then one of the local plants was reprofiling and able to print the required 100 valves overnight.
Since the first outbreak of COVID-19, various conspiracy theories, disinformation and fairy information about the origin of the virus, its extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects have spread at a high rate on the Internet.
It's possible that humans can infect other animals with the virus.
Research did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
At present, there is no approved vaccine for the virus or medicines for its treatment.
Various international research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 is currently being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITY TRIAL, which aims to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing compounds considered to be most effective to date.
A complete vaccine does not yet exist, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidate drugs.
Both SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov2 enter human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so the research results from previous SARS-Cov studies are used in scientific development.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers seek to create a whole-virionic vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid human immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a sub-unit vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that makes the immune system more sensitive to certain sub-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-Cov-2, such research is aimed at destroying the S-Sipoid protein, which helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, new vaccine methodology).
Pilot vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease; the antibodies increase has been identified as a potential problem in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are under way.
The drugs approved for malaria treatment were evaluated in seven tests, four of which were hydroxychloroxin or chloroxin.
Reprofiling of antiviral drugs is the majority of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine phase III studies on remdesivir had been conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for COVID-19 was conducted. For the same purpose, several other existing antiviral drugs for COVID-19 treatment, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta, are also being considered.
As of March 2020, preliminary data on the effectiveness of the use of remdesivir are available.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients who received remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III of clinical trials is already under way in the US, China, and Italy. The use of chlorochine previously used for malaria treatment was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for an expert evaluation of the study.
Korea and China ' s health authorities recommend the use of chlorochine.
The Wuhan Institute of Viviology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and could lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use permit for hydroxychloroquine and chlorochine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19.The Chinese guidelines of the 7th edition also indicate interferon, Ribavirin or umifenovir as anti-COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of Ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-Cov2 in vitro.
Nitasoxanyde was recommended for a detailed study in vivo, demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that syringe syringe 2 (TMPRSS2) protein is required to penetrate SARS-COV-2 by interacting with the ACE2 receptor.
Research into the use of chlorochine and hydroxychlorochin with or without azithromicin has serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further investigation. Oseltamir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinetics may occur as a complication in the late stages of the heavy form COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychlorochin may have properties of hypercytokinetics, and a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China has led to the inclusion of tocilysumab in the recommendations for the treatment of the coronavirus.
The drug has reached the 2nd stage of the non-randomized test, which is carried out at the national level in Italy, after positive results have been obtained from patients with severe diseases.
Combined with a blood serum test on Ferritin to detect cytokin storms, it is designed to counter factors that are believed to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, an antagonist of the Interleitin-6 receptor was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies to treat the release of steroid refracter cytokins caused by another cause, the CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilysumab is an effective cure for cytokin release syndrome.
The transmission of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by immune systems of patients recovering from COVID-19 to people who need them is now considered as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for the treatment of SARS patients, but its results have been unconvincing.
The neutralization of the virus is the expected effect by which passive antibodies therapy can provide protection against SARS-COV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibodies, cytotoxicity and/or pagocytosis, may also be used.
Other forms of passive antibodies therapy, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of reconcentrated blood serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of the recovering patients and contains antibodies against the virus, may be increased.
Coronavirus diseases, group of highly similar syndromes
Li Wenyan, a doctor at Uhanya Central Hospital, later infected and died of COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
