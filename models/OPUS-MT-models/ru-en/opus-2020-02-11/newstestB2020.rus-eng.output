Ma Xiaoguan, the spokesman of the State Council of the PRC for Taiwan Affairs, announced this on Friday.

This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone or by any means, Ma Xiaoguán stressed.
TikTok hides bad videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under 18 years of age.
Imagine China / Reuters
China's TikTok social network censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet's independence, or the banned Falun Gong religious group, tells The Guardian.
Documents available to the publication indicate that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) is promoting China's foreign policy objectives abroad by means of an application.
Most of China's policy-related violations fall under "hate speech".
In each case, TikTok places inappropriate publications in a context suited to the general rules so that social network actions do not look censored.
For example, the ban on criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general prohibition of "criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.".
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under "the risk of China's or other countries' history".
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen", including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sen and Kim Jong Eun, Indian politics of Mahatmu Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese premier Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Kyung Hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian premier Narendra Modi, as indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications in the first category are removed by social media administrators and may cause the user to be blocked.
Not too severe are the second category: such publications remain on the website, but their dissemination is limited to TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance explained to The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applied: "We now use a localized approach, as well as an independent local professional."
Russian users of TikTok do not have specific restrictions on publications, says the co-founder of the "Preducer Center" Rustem Bogdanov.
The "Preducer Center" is one Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All blogs' promotional materials, "Predusser Center", are in agreement with social media representatives, but user material can be posted without agreement, and is handed over to Bogdanov.
To the question of whether TikTok can speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says that he has seen such publications.
Bogdanov agrees with the founder of the agency Our Digital Roman Zaripov: "The basic rules for users of TikTok list in the user agreement: you can't put out shocking content that discriminates against words and so on."
But under these rules, any content that the moderators don't like is marked by Zaripov.
The Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under the age of 18.
According to the user agreement, only persons over the age of 13 can use TikTok.
Social media administrators test their age with artificial intelligence: neurosmart analyzes faces and determines how many years a person looks, tells the Bogdans.
If the neuropath decides that the user is younger, his account can be removed, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork.

In Rossinnadzor, the results of the examination of the amputation of the child ' s arm were reported

An 11-year-old boy broke his arm and was then given a cast in the hospital in Zernograd District.
After a while, the child developed gangrene and was amputated.
The audit found that the timeliness and accuracy of the diagnosis, as well as the standard and amount of assistance provided, were compromised.
The verification materials have been transmitted to the UKMS of Russia for the region.
Previously, URA.RU reported that the head of the Southern High Hospital had been arrested.
The Russians warned of false calls from banks.
In Russia, there has been an increase in the number of calls from fraudsters replacing the bank's phone number.
This is reported by Commersant with reference to Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator handed over to the telecommunications operators more than 2,500 numbers from which clients of various financial organizations had been called.
In 189 cases, operators found a room changer.
Another 218 numbers were blocked and in 59 cases restricted the use of financial services.
The deputy head of the Department of Information Security of the CEC, Artem Sychev, explained that a wide range of Russian banks had been confronted with the replacement of the room.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank's warning of fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such a duty in the Communications Act.
At the Bank of Open, Rosbank and Alpha Bank, information was confirmed that there had been an increase in the number of fraudulent cell phone calls.
According to Biline's press service, some of the information on fraudulent calls that the BC gave was incorrect: the lists included numbers that banks actually used to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would cause disruption to the organization.
Artem Sychev told us that Centobanc is planning to create a database of fraud numbers to which the communications operator will call every call to check the number.
He explained that such a framework would require legislative amendments.

The violations were referred to the State Duma Commission.
Google later stated that the company supported responsible political advertising.
In the opinion of the staff, it is bound by the laws of the country.

Stoltenberg discussed Ukraine ' s accession to NATO with Zelen
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership in the alliance on the margins of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
This was the subject of a gynecologist's presentation at Columbia University in New York.
Responding to the question as to whether the topic had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg stated that they had indeed discussed the issue, and also stressed that he had not indicated in his reply the timing of Ukraine ' s accession to NATO.
He said that any country that wished to join the North Atlantic Alliance had to meet certain conditions to meet specific standards, writing RT.
In Crimea, the Zelena alternative was offered to NATO.
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, should, instead of joining NATO, pursue good-neighbourly relations with Russia.
On Friday, 27 September, the Co-President of the Assembly of the Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Cegrinc, announced this.
"The President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but should listen to the advice of [US President] Donald Trump, who listened with his sour face and had a relationship with the President of Russia," said the Czech journalist RIA Novosti.
The Chegrinsky noted that Zelensky was a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
He said that only if relations with the Russian Federation were established would the Ukrainian President be able to remain in power.
On 27 September, NATO Genec Jens Stoltenberg reported that he had a conversation with Zelensky on the country's joining the alliance.
In order to do so, he said, Ukraine was obliged to fulfil certain conditions.
On 5 June, the deputy welcomed Evgeny Balitsky, who said that Ukraine ' s possible membership in the alliance did not guarantee a better life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
Barcelona is blackmailing Neimar.
Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the attacker moved to French Pari Saint-Germain.
The case was almost brought to trial, but the Catalan offered the player a solution to the dispute without the intervention of Femida.
Otherwise, they refuse to return him.
Neimar and his clever father, who is also an Brazilian agent, had an interesting focus: by agreement with Barsa, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the Forward ended up in the PSW for a record 222 million euros.
Nevertheless, he received $22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Not only do Brazilian lawyers insist that the club also owes him interest for late payment.
When Neumar's claims became known in the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counter-claim.
The Blue Granauts insist that the bonus was due for the entire contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that only one quarter of the Euro40 million was owed to the player and demands that the proportionate part of the first payment be returned.
But the interesting thing is, during the summer, Neimar and Barsa almost agreed to bring back a rogue Catalonia player.
True, the deal failed, but there's still hope for a return forward.
So, according to Sports.Ru, with reference to insiders, the club lawyers told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims were not settled in the pre-trial procedure, it would prevent the Brazilian from returning.
Neymar himself wants to come back so much that he asked for assurances that the Catalan men would buy him back.

How to Increase Future Pensions and Not Recycle
It is possible to pay not only the Russian Pension Fund but also non-State pension funds.
The NPF is a private company, reporting Volgograd Truth.
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the fund invests them, and in time it returns money to you with interest.

In addition, a contribution could be made for a relative, such as a housewife.
A recommendation for those who think about a pension at the beginning of their journey to work.
Increased pension payments are paid to public servants, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who have worked for a certain number of years in the regions of the Far North.

Buy real estate, currency, securities, deposit money.
The most important thing is to constantly increase your financial literacy.

It is noted that the fourth BSEC reactor management room was accessed by a group of 15 media representatives as part of the guide ' s presentation on the exclusion zone.
According to Telegram channel RT, journalists were in special protective costumes for less than five minutes, as the ruins of the blasted power unit are still venting radiation, 40,000 times the norm.
The accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant occurred on the night of 26 April 1986.
Twelve provinces in Ukraine and 23% of the area of Belarus were exposed to radiation pollution.
In Russia, 19 regions were affected.
It will be recalled that last July, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree stating that there was a green corridor open to tourists in the Chernobyl zone.
Also in the exclusion zone, the ban on filming has been lifted.
Previously, it was reported that the BSEC exclusion zone from Belarus had been opened to tourists.
The tour organizers stressed that less radiation could be obtained in the zone in a day than during the flight on the plane.

Which club will take the paroled Pavel Mamaev
A football player, Pavel Mamaev, released last week from parole colony, will not return to the Krasnodar football club.
This club's former quarterback can soon sign a contract with the Rostov FC, reports the Championship portal.
According to the publication, negotiations between the representatives of Rostov and Mamaeva are now in the final stages.
The contract with a 31-year-old football player is expected to be signed for two years, with the possibility of an extension for another season.
"Sport Express" says that Paul Mamaev was to undergo a medical examination at the Moscow Dynamo the previous day, but the test was not performed because of the "undefined situation in the club".
Krasnodar terminated the contract with Mamaev last week by agreement between the parties.
He played for the Reddar Club since 2014.
With the team, he won twice the bronze of the Russian Championship.
Previously, Mamaev was in favour of the Moscow Torpedo and the CSA.
From 2009 to 2016, Mamaev played for Russia, with 15 matches.

A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a truck found in a garbage pile.
A resident of the U.S. city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested for attempted murder after swinging a samurai sword at his opponent in an argument because of a cart found in the trash.
A 54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging through a pile of garbage near an empty house.
It was noticed by Todd Beavers.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the scum.
Miller saw Beavers' find and got upset.
He thought he could claim the cart because he started digging in the trash first.
Men started arguing.
Suddenly Beavers grabbed the cart and ran with it towards his house.
Then Miller took the Samurai sword he found in the same pile and pursued the opponent.
He caught up with Beavers outside his house.
Miller took the sword out of the knife and started waving it in the direction of the cart's kidnapper.
Beavers told Miller that what's going on is on video.
After seeing the video camera, Miller escaped, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and walked into the house.
Shortly thereafter, he saw an unknown woman entering his yard and taking the cart, screaming insult.
The police were already looking for Miller for a driver without a license.
The man was arrested, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager had attacked an unknown woman and wounded her with a sword.
Thus, he reacted that the guests at the wedding, which was celebrated at the same hotel where he stayed, had not given him a light.
Mass disorder for three.
The Moscow case against the participants in the summer protests the further away, the more visible the fragmentation into individual fragments and the loss of political content.
Evidence of the very fact of "mass disorder" cannot be verified, but in the absence of a political decision to dismiss the case on the brakes, a weak evidentiary basis would not necessarily lead to the dismissal of the charges.
The failure should encourage society, but it will certainly leave the silovists, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have been in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disorder), Alexei Minialo, was suddenly released without any obligation, and after a few hours was completely rehabilitated: the CRS dropped the charges against him.
Minialo has been under arrest for almost two months and has been joined by several professional communities: historians, priests, literaryists.
Since then, only two accused of involvement in the riots have remained in the case (initially 13 accused): Sergei Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on 3 September, and Samariddin Rajabov, who was extended by the court the previous day until the end of December (who is also charged with violence against a representative of the authorities, art. 318).
The court sentenced the author of the joke petition to join the United States of America
The court of the Vidzem suburb of Riga punished the author of the joke petition for Latvia's accession to the United States of America, Denis Bartetsk.
It is noted that the man was given 80 hours of correctional work and one year of probation.
"Good sense is not the strongest part of our system," commented the Barteck judgment.
He also added that punishment is usually less than requested.
The collection of signatures for Latvia ' s accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, at the same time as this petition, the website collected signatures of Latvia's accession to the Galactic Empire and of the country's withdrawal from the solar system and the Milky Way.
It is noted that criminal proceedings have been instituted against the Bartecki under the first paragraph of article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country, "Public call to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia".
Prior to that, in 2016, the author of the online petition for Latvia ' s accession to Russia received six months ' imprisonment.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes punishment for insulting police officers on the Internet
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation has prepared amendments to the Police Act to protect law enforcement guards from disseminating slanderous and vilifying information on the Internet.
On Friday, a request for public discussion of the draft law was made on the federal legal portal, and the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document states that it is being developed in response to the need to protect the honour and dignity of a police officer from "dissemination in information and communication networks, including the Internet, of information of a degrading nature, including those of a discrediting nature".
The exact manner in which police officers are to be protected from online defamation is not specified.

The first violation of the prohibitions is punishable by a fine of between 30 and 300,000 rubles, and the second offence by administrative arrest for a period of up to 15 days.
On 12 April, Roscomnadzor applied this rule to the media for the first time, blocking the Jaroslav edition of 76.ru.
Shortly thereafter, the Miracle District Court of Novgorod province fined a local citizen 30,000 rubles for placing on the network "two records of indecent information that offends human dignity and public morality and manifests a clear disrespect for society, the State and the authorities exercising State authority in the Russian Federation".

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogans help to prolong youth?
The subject of phytoandrogen is poorly studied.
Of the most famous, pollen-forming.
However, phytoestrogens are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with age (including cardiovascular diseases, some cancers).
Prominent sources of phytoestrogens are all beans (the most popular soy), hommel, flint seeds.
Many experts believe, however, that such BADs cannot be a complete substitute for natural hormones.
The possible harm from such additives cannot be ruled out.
For example, in the context of their intake, the production of their own hormones may be reduced by the fact that there are too many outside analogs.

The Hydromet Center called the faithful people's signs
In Russia, there are many popular acceptances by which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At Hydromet Center, they checked all the signs that were supposed to be working.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can really be trusted, though in the short term.
As the scientific leader of Russia's Hydromet Centre, Roman Wilfand, said, if the sun is red during the sunset, then the next day will really be fine, as our ancestors pointed out.
And if the sky shines white, then the next day it will rain.
The second one is based on bird surveillance.
They talk more about the swallows, if they fly low, it's usually raining.
The explanation is simply that when the air humidity is high, the fly is soaked in its wings and the feathers are forced to fall to hunt insects, TASS writes.
There are people's marks on different continents.
Storm Day is a traditional people's holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on 2 February.

Unidentified oil spots were found on the beaches of north-east Brazil
Oil spots of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches in north-east Brazil.
Pollution sights were scattered over 2,000 kilometres of the coastline.
Reports of the first oil stains discovered began to arrive as early as September 2.
However, their number continued to increase every day until Thursday, as did territorial coverage.
The Brazilian Environment Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turned out that all of them were identical, and it was crude oil that was involved.
At the Petrobras State Oil Corporation, which was passed on for analysis of the samples found, they stated that they did not correspond to the oil produced from the fields in Brazil.
"It's thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after the tanks have been cleaned.
Many continue to do so.
And it's probably in the ocean current," told Brazil's G1 news portal the coordinator of the Pernambuco Petroleum Workers' Union and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that despite the ban on this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states of the north-east of the country, environmentalists found nine sea turtles completely covered with oil film.
And only two of them managed to be saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute will work with Petrobras to clean up contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the Institute ' s experts recommend to tourists and locals that they bypass the oil spots and alert them to any pollution that has been detected.

Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev has commissioned Rossnemoradzor, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Enterprise, together with the business ombudsmen and the business community, to review the sanitary and epidemiological rules and regulations for the general public.
They will also have to study the transition to the application of the requirements of the regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union in the management of nutrition.
The agency's proposals are due to be submitted to the Government no later than 15 October, and are mentioned in the list of instructions given by Mr.medev following the 11 September "Dialogue" programme on Russia 24.
By the same time frame, Mr. Medvedev instructed all the agencies mentioned above, in addition to the Ministry of Justice, to submit proposals for an experiment to restrict control activities for general-health organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and Kaliningrad province, with effect from 1 January 2020.
The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Economy were instructed to submit to the Government, before 11 November, a bill amending the CAA on the application of an administrative suspension for the violation of the nutritional requirements that caused the damage to health.
In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Economy, Rossornadzor and the Ministry of Finance need to consider a gradual transition from 2021 to a consumer basket based on a basic set of products to produce a healthy diet.
As a matter of fact, the old standards of the business community have come to mind since the closure of an Anderson Café.
The business community demanded the cancellation of the existing San Piña, and Rosspernadzor announced that new ones would be jointly developed.
There are 33 agencies on the list.
In the meantime, Rosusenadzor intends to reduce health regulations by 40 times by 2021.

The Russians have nothing to postpone their retirement - V. Matvienko
The Speaker of the Federation Council, Valentina Matvienko, considers that Russians do not have sufficient savings to have a bill on a guaranteed pension product in full force in the country.
The practice of increasing the pension on the basis of personal savings is quite common worldwide.
Another matter is how timely we are to introduce it.
"In my view, a large proportion of the population now has income, of which they simply have nothing to allocate to increasing pension coverage in the future," said V. Matvienko.
The Russians, in the view of the Speaker, are unable to understand the mechanisms for the formation and calculation of pensions, since "the constant changes in this area have completely confused them".
This does not mean that I oppose the improvement of the pension system governing its legislation.
"Russia is a social state, and we have a duty to do everything we can to make sure that the amount of pensions and the social security of citizens improves.
But steps in this direction must be deliberate, responsible, responsive to domestic realities," said V. Matvienko, "RIA News".
The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the Pension Guaranteed Product Bill) were to evolve, several basic principles, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the State to ensure the preservation of pension savings, should necessarily be included.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced that a draft law on a guaranteed pension product (SPP) would be sent for negotiation.
Its main elements are the purely voluntary procedure for citizens to join the system of savings, the guarantee of long-term public pension savings, the registration of citizens ' savings accounts by the central administrator, tax incentives for business and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man stays in Marvel's fucked-up.
Sony and Disney agreed.
The rights holder of the illustration of Getty Images Image Caption News about the departure of the beloved superhero from the culpable Marvel caused anger among many loyal fans
One of the most famous comic book heroes, Spider-Man, will remain in Marvel.
Disney and Sony Pictures were able to agree on the rights to use it in franchise films.
This was reported in Sony's press release, which states that the third part of "Spiderman" with Tom Holland will appear on the screen on July 16, 2021.
Disney and Sony Pictures were previously reported to have been unable to reach consensus on income-sharing, leaving the Spider-Man behind.
Sony owns film rights.
She rented them for Marvel films, owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony earned revenue from the film cassettes and Disney earned money from souvenirs and toys.
It was reported that at some point Disney had ceased to do so, and the company wanted to reconsider the agreement.
President Marvel Studios Kevin Faiga said he loved it.
It's amazing that Spadey's trip to the lucky Marvel will continue.
"We are all at Marvel Studios very happy to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a mark figure.
It's a hero whose history affects all generations and audiences around the world," says his press release.
In doing so, Faiga recalled that Sony was also creating his own guinea pig built around Spider-Man.
"So it happens that he's the only superpower hero who's found himself in all sorts of menacing.
So while Sony continues to develop his own Spidey universe, the future can bring unexpected surprises," he pointed out.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently, commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram account an extract from the film "Wolf of Wall Street", in which Leonardo de Caprio's hero screams "I'm not leaving!"
Information on the contradictions between companies came out in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted half of the cash flow from the Spider-Man movies, provided that both companies paid half of the cost of painting production.
But it didn't suit Sony.
The news of the possible departure of a beloved superhero from the culpable Marvel has caused anger among many loyal fans.
The details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but stated: "We have cooperated well for the past four years, and our shared desire to continue working together was commensurate with the wishes of many of the [Spider-Man].
We're glad we can move forward together."
The film "Avengers: Final", which brought together Spider-Man, Torah, Hulk and other superheroes Marvel, became the most cashier in the history of the world filmmaker, replacing the Avatar from the top.

A prominent blogger, Andrei Poltave, has been searched: what is known so far
On Friday, 27 September, in Poltava, the house of relatives of the volunteer and blogger Andrei Karpov, known as Andrei Poltava, is being searched.
The blogger himself reported this on Facebook, noting that he does not live at this address.

The second similar explosive device placed in the car will be detonated today near the home of the famous Ukrainian propaganda Karpov, Andrei Anatolievich (also known as Andrei Poltava) ...
Death to the tormentors."
Karpov believes that his activities as a volunteer, politician, and blogger do not like Russian occupiers.
Poltava's followers are confident that he's making the right broadcasts and that he wants his strength and his tremors.
Remember, Poltava talks to the Russians about the Donbas war, the annexation of Crimea, peace, politics, and then posted the video on the Internet.
The blogger ran for Verkhovna Rada from the European Solidarity Party.
Now he's running TV stations on the channel "Routine", where he's harshly critical of Russian propaganda.
In 2017, according to ICTV, Karpov was recognized as Ukraine's best blogger.

The socio-economic impact of all changes must be taken into account," Siccut stressed.
This fall, the Riigikogu Commission for the European Union launched a series of parliamentary hearings to prepare a decision with which Estonia will participate in the EU negotiations on the 2050 climate goals.

In Congress, Trump and Zelensky saw a "Russian trail"
In the lower house of the U.S. Congress, the Russian Federation was accused of involvement in a scandal caused by a telephone conversation between the head of the White House, Donald Trump, and the Ukrainian President, Vladimir Zelensky.
The assumption that the Russians might somehow be behind this story was made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, who passed on the MSNBC News.
"The Russian Federation, I believe, has attached a hand to this," said the Democrat, but did not comment further.
Democrats led by Pelosi, who hold the majority in the House, have previously announced the launch of impeachment proceedings against the President.
This happened after Trump was complained about by an intelligence informant.
The informant suspected that in a conversation with Zelensky in July Trump had put pressure on his interviewer to bring Ukraine into action against the son of former Vice-President Joseph Biden, and that the latter could become a rival of Trump in the elections in one year's time.
The White House had to provide Congressmen and the public with a transcript of the scandalous conversation.

Rosposnadzor categorically opposes the return of chickens to airports
Rosposnadzor is categorically opposed to returning chickens to airports.

The expert explained why we should give up tea in bags.
A group of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found that more than ten billion microplastics are being injected into a cup of tea in five minutes.
The bagged drink can also add sawdust particles, says the National News food safety expert Elizabeth Tikhonov.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information about the composition of the bagged tea - the manufacturer may add ingredients that will not be listed on the package.
The sawdust don't throw away at the end of the season, so they might end up in tea.
"Best of all, it's not always tea plants that are included in bags," said Tihonova.
She said that it would be better not to use such a drink in favour of the tea on the scale sold in specialized shops.
In addition, she stressed that the risk of bagged tea was not only in the composition but also in its production method - microparticles were heated to high temperatures, which could lead to the release of harmful substances.
"The best way to buy pure green or black tea is to have the least supplement in such a drink," the expert pointed out.

It's time to build interregional links.
The Council Committee on Economic Policy of the Federation compiled information from the regions on their business development and self-employment programmes, as well as the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions explained to the senators the problems of SME development and submitted proposals to improve existing legislation.
"To date, communication between regions has not been sufficiently developed, as a result of which the business community in all regions of senatorial visits has identified the lack of information on regional entrepreneurship development programmes in the country as a whole", Andrei Kutepov noted.
In an annex to the letter sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments in the regions on the legalization of self-employment and a summary of proposals and issues from the regions (available for revision).
In addition to the line ministries, consolidated data from the regions have also been sent to the heads of the regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on good practices in the regions could stimulate the development of entrepreneurship in general.
The first step towards such an exchange would be to provide information available to the Committee on Economic Policy," said the parliamentary newspaper Senator.
Useful experience
Small and medium-sized business support programmes have now been adopted and successfully implemented in many regions of the country.
For example, the Vologoda Region has an Enterprise Support Centre, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.

A number of other regions have adopted special support measures for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to be brought out of the shadows
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of legislative changes should be made to better support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the Arkhangelian region proposed replacing the term "self-employment" with "business activities", as this "is the most consistent with the content of the public service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens".
In the Ivanov region, amendments are considered necessary to expand the range of self-employed activities, including the cleaning and repair of accommodations, holiday constructions and physical training sessions.
The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen the control of unfair dairy producers through the Mercury Veterinary System.
In the Kostrom and Magadan regions, the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the areas of support for social entrepreneurship are promoted in the legal and regulatory framework.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills", Andrei Kutepov assured.
The airline helped the passengers avoid a neighbourhood with crying children.
Japan Airlines (JAL) has launched a new feature: when booking seats on the plane, you can now find out where the little kids will be sitting.
Now, if you want to live next door with them, you can avoid them.
Japan Airlines (JAL) passengers were given the opportunity to take advantage of the new option and avoid an undesirable neighbourhood with small children.
The aircraft carrier has set up a function to track where the children will be sitting.
In the course of booking, passengers will be able to see the image of the child ' s head on the ground, which is occupied by children between the ages of eight days and two years.
Thus, those who do not want to fly near the babies because of possible inconveniences associated with their crying can stay as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the services of the airline are thrilled with the innovation.
Some thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do likewise.
One of the lasers complained that he had flown from New York to Doha a few weeks ago and had three crying children sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested the introduction of "youth-only flights", expressing willingness to pay extra for such a flight.
Many tourists have noted that they will now always try to choose Japan Airlines for their travels, as they see nothing pleasant about flying next to a crying child in a closed space.
Previously, a woman travelling with a baby tried to approve of her travellers during Seoul-San Francisco's flight.
She prepared a bag of sweets for each of the 200 passengers, each with an apology note.

The men reportedly left the Russian Federation for Ukraine and then went to the States where they applied for asylum.

Pavel Ustinov joined the pickets in support of the Moscow cause.
Pavel Ustinov joined a series of "Free All" single pickets, which take place on Friday outside the Russian President's Office in the Old Square in Moscow, and is being broadcast by Interfax.
The picket series began on 18 September in support of the Ustin itself and has continued every day since then.
At present, the participants in the event, in turn, stand in the hands of a sign bearing the inscription "Free All" and the names of the convicted and arrested persons after the unconfirmed meetings in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
In addition to Ustinov, on the poster, the names of Egor Zhukov, Kirill Zhukov, Daniel Begletz, Eugenia Kovalenko, Konstantin Kotov, Ivan Podkopaev, Idar Gubaydulin, Alexei Minialo, Sergei Fomin, Samariddin Rajabova, Nikita Chirtsov, Eduard Malyszewski, Vladislav Sinitsa.
On 16 September, the Tver Court of Moscow sentenced 24-year-old Ustinov to 3.5 years ' imprisonment in a general regime colony on charges of violence against a member of the OMO on Rosgwardia at an unconfirmed act on 3 August in the centre of Moscow (article 318, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code).
Subsequently, on 20 September, at the request of the Attorney General ' s Office, the court changed Ustinov ' s preventive measure from detention to non-exit.
Thus, the petition for Ustinov's release received over 112,000 signatures in 24 hours.
The theatre and film artists started a flash mob in support of a colleague.
To participate in a single picket in solidarity with the actor, a line was set up on 18 September in Old Square.
Human rights defenders, journalists, academics, teachers, doctors and Orthodox priests required a review of the case.
According to Interfax Sister Ustinov Julia, her brother is not planning to speak at the 29 September rally in the capital in support of the Moscow case.
The supplies of the "sanctions" to Russia fell 100 times.
In the Russian Government, it was estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo had declined more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, 31,000 tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries in the first half of 2019, compared to 3 million 442,200 tons in the same period in 2013, Interfax reports.
However, the value of imported products fell to $226.5 million from $4,975.5 million, respectively.
This is a supply of goods that have not been embargoed.
According to the report, the loss of prohibited imports was offset by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia.
It will be recalled that, at the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from being imported into Russia as part of counter-sanctions.
In a document posted on the official legal portal, it was noted that the rules had been extended for one more year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Initially, products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada were subject to a sanctions destruction order.
Subsequently, since 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Ukraine have joined this list.
Putin's decree on the destruction of illegally imported "sanctions" (products under the food embargo imposed by Moscow in response to Western anti-Russian sanctions) entered into force in 2015.
The Government, in turn, allowed the destruction of the "sanctionary" food in any legal way.
As Western sanctions continued, the Russian Federation also extended its response.
However, products imported by citizens for personal use are not subject to this measure.
The prohibition does not apply to the importation of goods for personal consumption up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Michael Fedotov, had previously called "just immoral" the destruction of food products, which he said had a negative impact on the education of people.

In Chile, the telescope was built at a cost of Euro1 billion.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the Press Service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, this week the construction of a dome for the E-ELT telescope (European Extremelly Large Telescope) has officially begun, as long as the most expensive and ambitious ground astronomical project.
The total cost is estimated by ESO to exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the construction of equipment and the building of the observatory.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, with a diameter of about 39 metres.
It will be collected from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 metres.
This huge mirror, along with two auxiliary reflecting surfaces of 4.2 and 3.75 metres in diameter, will help E-ELT get the first detailed photos of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, as well as looking for Earth's doppelgangers.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surrounding areas of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Although the dome has just begun, mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory have been developing scientists, engineers and others for three years since the first E-ELT plans were announced.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, with a combined value of about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
