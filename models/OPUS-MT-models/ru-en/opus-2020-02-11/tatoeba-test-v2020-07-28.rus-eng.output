He's afraid of dogs.
The party was full of girls.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
How did you manage to impress Tom?
Why does he hate me?
Stop teasing him.
He's known her since high school.
Tom pretended nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
The accident almost cost him his life.
He opened the bottle.
We're home now.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I didn't agree.
Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you don't get me wrong.
Why are you so mysterious?
You're just running away from life's problems.
It's snowing outside.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.
I failed the exam.
Eat while it's hot.
Tom had to wait three hours.
What are you offering me?
Tom thinks Mary is an idiot.
I told Tom to wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you were coming, either.
I ran into Tom in Boston last week.
Tom is painting.

Tom went to the park alone.
You're a teacher, aren't you?
I won't try to convince you.
I knew Tom wouldn't lose.
Tom told Mary he was thirsty.
What are you grinning about?
Tom didn't say how he was going to get there.
Didn't I tell you I'm allergic to peanuts?
I know how old you are.
I won't show it to anyone else.
Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't want to upset Tom.

Why should Tom apologize?
The results were shocking.
This room is empty.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
Can you believe that?
We spent the night in the open.
Don't lock the door.
When are you free?
Shouldn't Tom have done that on October 20th?
I have to go to work now.
Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
Smelling is one of five senses.
What do you got?

I'm not a specialist.
I got a cold from him.
I like Brazil, but I'm going to Ukraine.
I made you breakfast.
I didn't think you'd let me do that.
I see Tom almost every day after school.
The humped grave will fix it.
The soup is so hot, it's impossible to eat.
Why is she so popular?
They pleaded not guilty.
Where did you get so hurt?
I don't think they're friends.

Remember, I love you.
He's said to be a murderer.
Mary didn't want to wear Halloween to an open suit, so she decided to dress like an amish woman.
Tom picked up his hat.
Tom waited three hours.

You knew Tom better than I did.
Maybe people like us shouldn't have children.
I won't do it again, I promise.
Every morning I go shopping.
The baby's kicking.
Tom refused to sign the document.

I hope I can help you.
Do your parents know about this?
The waitress put a white tablecloth on the table.
I stayed home that day because it was raining.
Is there a pharmacy nearby?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why is Tom looking at me like that?

We can discuss this later.
It's a little helpful.
Cats in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I speak frankly?

We want to leave.
The population of this city is declining every year.
Dan didn't want to sound shy.

But I don't have any money.
How do you like Mary's new dress?
There was fear on his face.
If you don't tell her, I will.
Can I trust you with a secret?
My mother died in a car accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Should we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your own fault.
Tom told everyone that he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Take her somewhere.
I was just there when it happened.

What did you and Tom do after dinner?
I'm very unhappy.
As often happens, Mike was late for a meeting this afternoon.

None of us want this to happen.
How much more wine do I have to buy?
I'm not kidding.
He got in the car and left.
Tell Tom everything that happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.

Everyone but Tom has hats.
She gives him everything he asks.
Is that for sale?
I'm getting angry.
Do you have a bigger one?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
It only adds to the problem.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of the flushing of a barrel in the toilet.
I called the doorbell.
Tell him I'm sick.
They've already left.
Can I borrow your car for a second?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jesse standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's some sugar in the bag.
I did that when I was a kid.
Something very good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't get involved in other people's business.
Who's wearing a blue T-shirt?
Tom has an American accent.
I don't have the money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
Carrots are good for your eyesight.

Do you like science fiction movies?
I'll make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to go upstairs.
His house is over the hill.
It was Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
That's a lot of pens!
Mary, are you right now?
I fixed the mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom did 20 push-ups.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary slapped Tom, threw a glass of wine through him and stepped out of the restaurant, and there was a dead silence.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We recognized them.
Tom will paint the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you're gonna need a loan.

Sing it again, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom realizes that he doesn't need it anymore.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in pots in winter.
I speak French.
If it sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where you found it.
Tom should have told Mary.
Why is everyone looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you this would work.
This all seems so weird.

Take out the trash.
Tom apologized to the audience.
Tell Mary I have her keys.
Did you buy candles?
Canada is home to ice hockey.
The brain is a very complex organ.
They'd agree.
Your Japanese is good.
The thief entered through the window.

A kiss without a mustache, like a soup without salt.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where are the other prisoners?
So much has happened today.
I saw a car hit a man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom worked with Mary.
I'm tired to death.
Do you know what your kids are doing right now?

I think there can be no other reason than this one.
I'm very happy right now.
My apartment was robbed last week.
How do you always get to be so energetic?
Put your signature here.
What an ego!
So you bought it?
A man as long as he feels and a woman as she looks.

Do you remember what you said to me?
There was a lot of snow last year.
He tried to swim across the river.
Everyone seems happy.

That's when I hurt my asshole.
I have nothing more to say about him.
What other choice did I have?
You should stay upstairs.
Come home early, Bill.
She sat on a chair and read a magazine.
From now on, it is forbidden to cry.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
This is the house he lived in.
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to the monkey.
Eat my chocolate?
Painted in white, the house seems bigger.

What's the point of doing this?
Which dog is yours?

Why are you sitting on my chair?
That sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy this.
I've never seen you wearing a hat.
Put it on the shelf.
I thought you found someone else.
There's always a lot of vehicles on this road.
You lied to us all.
I don't think Tom has brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
It doesn't make sense to pretend that you're making me believe that I believe in something you don't believe in!
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I've been pardoned.

I'm sick of you!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current state of affairs.
I know what you told her.
I didn't fall asleep until after two o'clock in the morning.
Mary wasn't thirsty.
Tom wasn't as hard to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I tried to wake Tom up.
They say that movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late because of the heavy rain.
Apparently, she's healthy.
Tom was wearing a straw hat.
Keep an eye on your little brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter peppers.

How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve a problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of God Ra.

What kind of pizza do you like the most?
Tom stood in front of Mary.
Take some more.

Typhoon destroyed a lot of houses.
This man was condemned to death.

I can't wait to see you.
Why are you wearing my shoes?

It's true!
Let's go get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.

Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom should be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll help you out.
We are proud of our achievement.
Tom should have invited Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop hitting the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know this man is who he says he is?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald Sinezuba, has established Christianity in Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
Tom has never seen Mary since.
You can't go to this room.
Did you have other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?

I'd like to talk to her again.

He hurt himself when he fell.

I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you keeping an eye on your weight?
Tom plays a trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?

You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.

Do you like those perfumes?

Have some cookies, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaryes.
Stand down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to go to Boston with us.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want what's best.
Tom works as a waiter.
It'll be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many suffer from underestimation?
Was it too easy?
What Alice encountered in waiting for an answer was a sudden war, which was a humming noise, so loud that it would tear her eardrums apart, and loud enough to reach heaven.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
Tom can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get her things into the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
Many books are published each year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked him for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, aren't you?
We need to hire him.
I tried in vain to solve the problem.
You should have done your homework.
I spoke on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
That rock was so heavy, I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
As soon as it's done, it's gonna come back.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tasted banana pie?
The girl who gave me the beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom wonderful?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.

I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to the children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed a tree.
The language I'm learning is very complicated.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Do you really live alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president has been in office for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Would you mind taking care of this?
Both Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
There's 20 floors in the building.
If you're not going, I'm not going either.
Do you happen to know when Tom is coming back?
I don't have pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a little bit?
Will you give Tom something for Christmas?
She's not gonna fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom tried to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he'd be a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time are you planning to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's as stubborn as an ass.
I think you can be relied on.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a feeling Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom spoke in his sleep last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say it again!
I called him, but some girl picked up.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very hard on the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom has a small mustache.
Do you understand what she said?
You seem a little distracted.
Don't be angry with her.
I'd rather stay.
Tom came up with a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place safe?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and clean.
I suspect Tom needs to go to Boston next week.
Don't walk on other people's land.
Tom watched terrifiedly.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where are you and Tom staying?
Don't you know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done here.
How do you like your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
We need a new curtain in the hall.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs hurt.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Did Tom swim?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't often do that.
I hope we don't do that again.
How many times have you helped Tom do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dance with Mary.
By the time I get there'll be an opening time.
I'm not sure what size it is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Tom stepped away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire him?
He and I cried.
Would you like to try again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you dressed like this?
You can make oil, cheese, and a lot of other things out of milk.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Be nice.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He winked back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You're gonna make it if you try.
Haven't you thought about asking Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
No one's hungry except me.
Tom is very excited.
No snowflake in a snow avalanche feels guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom to be here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'm gonna solve this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When does the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
It's a spit.
I really liked that book.
You're important.
When the ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she could stay at her place tonight.
Tom didn't tell the police his real name.
I went there to school.
The fish is still raw.
Try to stay positive.
I was sick.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Will it hurt?
There was a big red hat on the girl.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was tricked.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who do you want to play with Tom?
I need a light coat.
I finished my assignment.

Why aren't you sleeping?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you crying.
Show me how to do it!

Don't sit too close to the TV.
I wash my head almost every day.

I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom is better at cooking than I am.
He swims like an axe.
Tom didn't tell Mary what he needed to buy.
She brought the broom.
"Tom, hurry up." "I'm coming!"

I'm not like everyone else.
I managed to get two tickets to the concert.
He likes to brag about his father's successful car business.

I prefer a simpler approach.
They're great.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane's farewell speech made us very sad.
I try not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look mind-blowing.
I appreciate your help.
He couldn't hold his smile.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boyfriend"?
I didn't try to kill them.

Please turn off the radio.
He didn't seem sure of his answers.
I heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take off your jacket if it's warm.
There's so many of them.
He couldn't compromise his principles.
Mary says she's lonely.
It'll probably take you three hours to do that.
It was an easy decision.
Mary said she'd come early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
It can be anyone.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.

Looks like the bank robbery was planned down to the point.
Tom didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.

I want to talk to you about something.
The can's empty.
Why didn't you show it to Tom?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was swimming in the river.
Tell them to pick up the phone.
Can you tell us what this is?
Say no to racism.
Tom is a butcher, isn't he?
Don't make me kill you!

Do you know how dangerous that is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
Okay, everybody, listen up, please.
Is it made of wood or metal?

That's the wrong data.
There's a marked difference between them.
I know that some of you think Tom is lazy.
We need to tell Tom not to do that anymore.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's pretending.
Come closer.
We're staying at the Hilton Hotel.
Tom should tell Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box immediately, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She kept complaining that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
Something needs to be done.
She gave him a present.
Mary is studying in her room.
Attention, everyone!
That very second, I fell in love with that language.
Tom is safe, isn't he?
Did you order this pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom is a close friend of mine.
Don't do two things at the same time.
You shouldn't have gone to the woods alone.
No one sees my tears.
Tom slept again.
She really likes you.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are reusable.
Tom has never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you stopped by.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last fall.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!

We don't think it matters.
No one understands you like I do.

I think Tom is right.
It's depressing here.
Do you see a star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the rope!
You said so often.

I feel very sorry for Tom.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
The papers are on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know that.
Tom didn't tell us why he was so upset.
I knew it was him.
Tom is working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
You don't have anything to hide, do you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The bill should be paid by the first day of next month.

You're scaring her.
For me, Boston is a cold city, not like Chicago.
Tom was the victim of an attempted extortion.
I can't speak for my colleagues.
Does Tom live far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
The argument ended in a fight.
I didn't take it, you can check your pockets.
Tom came yesterday.
I'd like to leave a comment.
You chose the wrong person.
They took a great risk.

I paid for Tom.
There are a lot of people who think it's impossible not to get confused in their tongues.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Will the exam be today?
What motivates you?
Sami gave Layla his computer.
Roll up your sleeves.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom will agree to meet us?
They say anyone in America can be president, but they probably aren't.
Tom never forgot Mary.
Tom's name is the first one on the list.
What else did you miss?
Mary tried to calm down.

What time does this train arrive in Boston?
You didn't see that?
You need to call me.

I baked him cookies.
It's a neighboring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe what Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Please translate this into French.
Have some cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd grew rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
Tom is the one who told me about what happened.

You have to go back.
We've already talked.
I can't believe I finally managed to do that.

Don't worry, the test is light.
Why don't you just tell me?
What is the 13th month?
I don't know which book to choose.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
It's a tower.
I'm gonna have to wait.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.

What are you talking about?
When was the last time you were in Boston?

They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She has a double chin.
We can't force people to do that.
Let me carry it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I hate that color.
Are they sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still single.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
The neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom is lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She also has flaws.
I wonder why Tom needs it.
That seems suspicious to me.
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom isn't the only one here from Boston.
Are you gonna back me up?
Why don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
It's up to you to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.

Tom can get jealous.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you associate your childhood with?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom used the floor jack.
I'd like to lie down.
Lend me notes or something.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight, I don't want to leave the house.

Do you have any pen pals in Indonesia?
You might have to help her.

Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do that for you.
"Hi," said Tom shyly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows how much time.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new sentence like a message in a bottle, one day they'll translate it.
You're not gonna find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
He and I are soul mates.
I have a granddaughter your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?

The series needs to start watching when all seasons are off!
Road accidents happen every day.
Where did you go skiing?
Have you been to the barbershop?
The prospect is depressing.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ball handle.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept in two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Go away.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a picture together.
I failed the exam.
Everyone already knew about it.
You'd better go help her.

Let the cat out.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom thinks it's a sin to throw away food.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place is bent to the right.

I'm sure you will.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom wiped his whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's responding.
It's the nicest I've ever met.

I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same person I used to be.

I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just a shadow of himself.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to go to Boston with us next week.
Don't let them in.
Things happen.
What day is today?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me for who I am.
I'm just a guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.

Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.

Oh, my God, it's on fire!
I'm afraid you'll get lost.
I like to go to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see a volcano.
I know the owner.
The dog is yours.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm going to go to his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer put courage in his men.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying things like this.
I don't know much about hunting.
It's the first time I've made grilled meat at home.

How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everyone knew that already.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom is about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said so.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw the way he looked at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom should be home.
She was who I thought she was.
Tom showed the police his driver's license.
I get my hair cut every month.

Tom slept without a blanket.
Pray for us.
What kind of music do you listen to in the car?
That's what I was told three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French revolution began during Louis XVI's reign.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get an invitation from Tom?
I want to swim in the sea.
It will depend entirely on him.
I met a classmate.

I'm starting to think you're serious.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sure Tom would be happy to help.
It's Joanna.
I've made so many mistakes.
How can people do such things?
Tom is really sorry.
I like your glasses.
Rain water flows down that pipe.
I always thought Tom was a close friend.
I'm one of those girls who's more friends with guys.
Don't worry, I have insurance.
Tom will be here with me.
It's hard for my father to quit drinking.
No one's suggesting you do that.
He works for this company from Monday to Sunday.

Tom left with Mary.
Tom started laughing.
I'll call Tom tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic abilities.
Who is he by nationality?
Tom was sitting in the same cell with John.
I didn't want to swim.
He drank beer.
In modern times, it's the hardest thing for a man to be... himself.
I'll never talk to him again.
Shh, wake Tom up!
I'm gonna wear my handkerchiefs.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm the new teacher.
They're all kids.
She freaked out and yelled at me.
Did you take your medicine?
The bunnies are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
Time's on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
I doubt Tom is still angry.
You'll feel better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell the burning rubber?
That's not what happened here.
When's your father coming home?
I get it.
Tom handed Mary a book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of the shower.
Tom has a patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom will try to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom is going down.
Tom said that wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring salad to the party.
Her hair is sweaty.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much that weighs?
The conductor is a complimentary master.
Tom is married to Mary, isn't he?
All the benches in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
Everything works for me.

Dynamite invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to intervene.

I know you shouldn't do that.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've already spoken to this student.
What is the chemical mark for methyl-hydrogen acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
Tom needs to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do that.
Cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed as a janitor.
I respect his views, although I disagree with many of them.
The Towerblock is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him a sweater.
I don't think Tom will want to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
Is it cheaper to call after nine?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use it, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
How long do you plan on staying?
We ate quickly and left immediately.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop anything on your feet.
Start every meal from the soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right across from me.
The calith was open.
I brought you some wine.
I'm not popular.
It's his first day at school.
I'm dying to meet you.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?
They're dead.
The apples are big.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about that.
Is she singing?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's go by car.
You're bothering me.
She wondered what his lips would taste like.
A good coach trains this team.
The tree is sick.
The train was delayed due to heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What makes you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a United States citizen.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left her hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you eat?
Don't you recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom planned to do that or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom is wearing new shoes.
Last year she learned how to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Because it was winter, he didn't go outside.
Walking down the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses are there on your street?
Elephant tusks are made of ivory.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"What's up, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
Her mother tongue is French.
This coat is unfashioned.
She stopped for a smoke.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Naïveness is his only positive quality.
My hobby is insect collection.
Tom lived in Boston as a child.
I haven't eaten in six days.
Can I tell them that?
She's been quiet all day.
No matter what he says, don't trust him.
I've moved on.
Tom and Mary hope that their next child will be a boy.
Mary is always very welcoming, and she has a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep under lullaby.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could learn a lot from them if you only listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
I'm sorry I upset you.
Those who have never left their country are full of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when the snow falls.
Tom is helping his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd be back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I've turned on my imagination.
I thought we could do it.
My mom was against me driving alone.
I'm sorry, I misunderstand you.
You know what you're doing, right?
You can't trust a machine transfer.
She hit me, not him.
You wouldn't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
This river is full of fish.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
We're the same age as her.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms before?
The prisoner is released.
What did they say happened?
Could you leave the door open?
That's gonna have to wait.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows that he made a mistake.
Japan has a soft climate.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced the injured player.
Tom said he didn't believe that.
Our trip went very smoothly.
It's inevitable that I'll go to France one day, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom only pretends to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom is watching.
It's stopped raining, we can open the windows again.
This has never happened to me before.
I don't think Tom is lost.
I was gonna go out when the phone rang.
I don't have to put up with this.
Always give way to interference on the right.
We're being asked to introduce ourselves in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a lift if you want.
Tom told Mary that she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's a book on the table.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot about that.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
Your voice sounds like a melody song of sirens to me.
How does it feel to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like him.
My fingers left fingerprints on the glass.
Chemicals is a great science.
I feel like my French isn't getting any better.
How am I supposed to get a passport?

Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he has no choice.
It's still light outside.

It's my dad's car, but it's gonna be mine soon.
Did you forget his name?
If I had time to do that, I would.
Do you see Tom's boat?
Is Tom big?
This medicine will help you.
Stop making noise.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how busy I was?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I have no one to trust.
She's a fan of Sex in the City.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
You treat him well.
Tom wants to borrow my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do that?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing like a glass of beer after a long day's work.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long will it take you?
Let's take a break here.
Are you wearing new shoes?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom said.
She was squeezing the makeup when she saw the dog.
He's not any taller than me.
It's strictly forbidden to smoke.
This peach is beautiful.
Can you see that?

When were you gonna tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I filled the pitcher upstairs.
Go straight ahead.
I'm too tired to think about it now.
What house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What do we live for?
Will it rain this afternoon?
We know about her.
You could've helped us.
I don't drive often.
Tom doesn't like the ending of the film.
Just get inside.
Just apologize to him.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
You two make me sick.
I didn't know it was legal.
I like adventure.
Tom studies in the library.
Were you at school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you happy?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
It's gonna snow hard tomorrow.

He came up and got on his knees.

Next year I'll be three times older than you.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your stamp collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom isn't much taller than Mary.
No one seems to know him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
That cloth is poking on your skin.
I'm in love with you.
It'll be winter soon.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to do that.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up his professional guitar game.
I'm married now.

They spoke French.
It's extremely expensive.
He doesn't sing anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They still haven't woken up.
Tom is a couple of inches taller than Mary.
I'm glad you suggested that.
It's hard to answer your question.
You don't believe her?
English is the world's language.
That sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told Tom to leave Mary alone.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom is looking for a job.
Why does Tom need a hammer?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
Things are getting worse.
I choose where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
She's undressed.
I'm not gonna let you take my kids.
Don't give it to him.
Run, or you'll be arrested.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom made it his rule to meditate every morning.
Did you check your calculations?
He tried to write a short story.
A room without books, like a body without a soul.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What does your brother do?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you in ages.
I visited Tony yesterday.
It's easy to impress her.

Everyone turned around and looked at us.
Let me see.
White bears live in the Arctic.
I told you I was the best.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.

How unlucky I am!
I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He speaks Russian fluently -- at least that's what he told me.
Tom is a third-year student.
How long will you stay?
I'm not a woman.
She has a tall father.

I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.

The orchestra started playing.
Mary was wearing a pirate costume.
That's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention it before?

He was born at 7 a.m. on 5 June 1970.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.

A Japanese man would never do such a thing.
I miss Boston so much.
She writes letters all the time.
I don't know who to consult with.
Turn left on the corner.
Tom taught me how to do that.
There's a lot more to be done.
Give me one, please.
I can't stand naughty kids.
Tom bought it for me.
What you said made everyone angry.
You're too young for that.
My parents have been married for thirty years.
She's demonstrated her talents.
I wish that was possible.
I guess you can't do that.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
For the first time, Bob will play a major role at the next school festival.
You have to stay in shape.
I've been plowing seeds all day.
The accent made me realize he's an American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Have mercy!
Tom obeyed.
Everyone in my generation thinks the same.
That's what I live for.
Do you know how to ski?
The Duke owns many lands.
At least we had fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's slowly recovering.
You'll feel at home.
It won't end well!

I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who's Norman Finkelstein?" "American political scientist."
Get out of here!
If it's not a home sale, maybe it's a new way to meet girls.
Tom picked up a coin.
Why didn't you clean your room?
If there is no God, everything is allowed.
We're both named Mary.
I knew I should've married him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't make fun of them.
Please fasten your seat belts during take-off and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both like seafood.
I've waited a long time for this.
I turned down the offer.
Do you want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
It's gonna take me too long to explain why this isn't gonna work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build all this yourself?
I'm looking forward to my summer vacation.
Can we put this differently?
It looks great from here.
Wooden houses are easily flammable.
Let's throw Tom a party.
The dog's still alive.
I go to university.
I know you lied.
The bed is very comfortable.
I'll report on it tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a slut.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait here for him to come.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I need to think this through.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is José, we're friends.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do that without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who arranged the meeting?
I'm such an unlucky guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not gonna have any fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in a skirt.
What bird can't fly?
This has to stop.
Tom didn't respond immediately.
Tom died at the age of seventy.
Life is a gift.
Tom also speaks French.
The invention of the transistor marked a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.

Here are some pictures.
What's going on on Channel 10?
I hate spinach.
Mother's making lunch.
Tom is a pilgrimage.
What can I do?
Her son is a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's inclined to let his emotions out.
We were shocked to hear of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I haven't seen you.
You're just saying the obvious.
He had cancer.
It's your fault it happened.
He's just like a watch.
I know where you're going.
You're taking everything for granted.
Let's move him.
Let's keep this till tomorrow.
Perhaps Tom knows more than he's telling us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing this.
The cleaning lady interrupted the conversation.
There's a cat on the desk.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not limping anymore.
Tom was a heavy smoker.
Tom was wearing gloves.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom isn't used to this weather.
I wonder who's gonna help him decorate the snowman.
I still don't know why Tom did that.
Do you believe in soul mates?
What's that noise?
My son has a genetic disease.
It's disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can marry your dog.
The best defense is assault.
She's getting married this fall.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Is there anything we can do to help you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live in rice and fish.
When will you be ready to go?
Investigations began last year with the confiscation of the computer archives of a man from the German city of Magdeburg.
How are you?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What makes you think you can't?
We were going back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe that?
Thank you for the correction.
Are you crazy?
Stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get that scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom is sharpening his pencil.
Tom can't ride a bicycle.
I don't talk to a body at all.
What did Tom leave for?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild animals.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed to tears.
I spent $500 in one day.
Tell them to go home.
Put it anywhere.
They didn't make it on time.
It's 7:30.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who told Tom that.
Tom got up early to see the dawn.
The dinosaurs were extinct a long time ago.
I usually go up the stairs in one.
Tom has had a year.
I'm at the station.
Tom is a very good boy.
Are you drinking?
You're from Boston, aren't you?
Put it on my desk.
Tom got out of the water.
I was very proud of it.
You were ready.
Do you know Tom's brother?
All lizards can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
I've got things falling apart tonight.
I asked them to stay away from it.
Tom only learned to drive at thirty.
I'm glad he wasn't hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen knife wasn't sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my pen knife.
Honey, I can explain.
You'll soon adapt to village life.
Keep the bucket next to the water.
You're not a kid anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
The river is deeper than anything else.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I've told you that a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
You should probably tell Tom.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
The writing of words separately when they are to be pissed is a big problem in Norwegian.
What are you doing with the rest of the rice you cooked?
It's been ten years since she died.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Do you need anything else?
We left shortly after that.
This book is worth reading.
Tom and Mary did their homework before dinner.
I don't want your tea.
You're always so romantic.
Wife's not a boot. You can't get off your feet.
I'll pick you up at six.
I teach Tom French.
I like to learn other languages.
Mary has brown eyes.
I'd like to know how long Tom plans to stay in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
How did you feel?
Let's give Tom a chance.
I like fruit.
Tom lied.
He sells cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope not."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate caviar.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check it out.
Tom gave Mary the gun.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They got on the bus first.
Let's wait until Monday.
Does anyone here know them?
There must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to the smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you what time to come.
Of course I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get to the point.
Tom sat on the steps.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes lightning hits twice in the same place.
I'm not bragging.
Leave it for later.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door unlocked.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.
It's up to you.
Were you surprised?
We counted the annual rings on the tree that we cut down, and determined that he was thirty years old.
I feel like I've known you my whole life.
I want Tom never to write to my daughter again.
Rabbits breed quickly.
I don't want to talk about it right now.
What's it gonna cost to clean your coat?
We'll paint it.
The opening is narrow.
I'm not afraid to go to the cave.
When happiness knocks on your door.
You need to listen to her.
I'd like you to know how much you mean to me.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
Tell me frankly.
I'll come no matter what.
Do you mind making another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Honolulu.
You're not telling me anything I wouldn't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left last.
Tom signed the petition.
Have you tried talking to Tom about this?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
