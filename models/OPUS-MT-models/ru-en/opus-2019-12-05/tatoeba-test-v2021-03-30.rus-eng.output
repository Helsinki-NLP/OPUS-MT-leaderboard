Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke the terrible, from the point of view of the Jews, of the Galilian dialect of the Arabic language instead of the Hebrew language, thereby showing the inappropriateness of the allegations of the existence of a sacred language, the use of which in prayer is particularly close to God.

I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When did it start?
No one cares what she thinks.
I don't think that's weird at all.
"Where did you get my phone?" "Tom gave."
When are you gonna clean up the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Does it make sense to fix it?
Why are you locking the door?
Tom said he tried to do it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.

Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
It's not gonna happen.
I'll order that later.

This is our school.
I was free all day last night, and I'm working today.
Take your coat, it's cold today.
If you think about it, I really need a mobile phone.

You should try not to sleep.

My older brother, Tom, was born here in Boston.
I thought you hated him.

I felt the smell of food long before I entered the house.
My father painted a mailbox in red.
A lot of people ignore laughter.
Except for Tom, everyone in the family speaks French.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
Don't mind them.
I know you don't like me.
The police found Tom dead on the porch.
I'm not as lucky as you.
I did everything you asked me to do.
You're planning on buying a house?
There's a cat on the table.
Tom says he doesn't want to go to Australia with me.
I came, I saw, I won.
Life is not always fair.
I saw Tom take your keys.
The whole night was ruined by Tom and Mary's fight.
Can you read it?

I don't expect you to believe that.
We've seen a lot of unusual plants in the botanical garden.
Sometimes a little gift can be a manifestation of great love.
Do you prefer a blonde or a brunette?
I didn't get on the bus.
Tom didn't like that movie.
You want us to help you?
Be realistic.
Tom was planning a party.
I'll get someone to help.
Why didn't you tell us that before?
Is that Chinese or Japanese?
Fry it.
I'm making progress.
You're pale as a ghost.
I'll be home by 6: 00.
French is not that complex.
Let's get out of the cab.
He was a sod.
Tom never missed school.
I suggest you do it today.
I'm not gonna marry her.
Tom drinks apple juice.
You're going by train?
We think so, too.
How could something like this happen?
You're an actress.
Tom was mentally ill.
I forgot to ask.
My hands and legs always get cold.
How do you translate words that are not in any languages other than mine?
Can you tie it with a tape?
I'm going home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.

Eleven is a simple number.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Coffee's on me.
We're husband and wife.

What's so sad about you?
I'm too busy to talk to you right now.

Tom says he wants to be buried here.
Where did you get the screwdriver?
A third of the prisoners ran away.
All praise be to God.
You think Tom knows?
I'm crying this time.
Tom was acting like a child.
Stop singing.
Only six people came to the party.
What have you decided?
I didn't know you were a romantic.
I saw you spying on Tom.
I need you to do it now.
The robber entered the house through that door.
I know how to survive.
Mary worked most of her life.
Mary's boyfriend's name is Tom.
I'm afraid I have a confession to make.
Tom was expected to be there yesterday.
Tom was an important man.
I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget to sign.
You'll be safe there.
I'm in Tehran.
"You speak Greek?" "No, that's my first lesson!"
Why did you give him the money?
Did Tom buy anything for Mary?
You went to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis last night.
Let me do it again.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you get her to talk?
I've been to Sapporo before.
I told you to get out of here.
We will do our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom's gonna be late for the plane.
She always gets up early.
You want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We were sitting at the very bottom of the audience.
You will survive.
What did she buy from that store?
When will we have a woman president?
He came to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is not far from our school.
It's a cookie I've been drinking for you.
England looks like Japan in many ways.
Tom would never do that.
I suggest you try more.
Lai's not gonna scare the baby.
Don't fight back.
Tom has the keys.
When I'm in a bad mood, I like to think about the mines to get comfortable.
How would you feel if someone did this to you?
We both really want to sleep.
Tom just can't do whatever he wants.
Tom doesn't often tell us jokes.
The onions can be used in a lot of dishes.
There's almost no snow here.

Do you speak English?
My brother will kill me.
I opened the flare.
Tom can stay with me.
Is it difficult to learn Greek?
Will Tom come with you?
Where's the remote control remote control?
I can't find her either.
You'll speak Swedish.
Have you seen anyone else?
Tell me why you're here.
Don't hang up.
Tell Tom not to get his eyes on him.
We looked out the window, but we didn't see anything.
You want to work with them?
It was an interesting movie.
I'm out of my mind, I'm working from morning to night.
What time are we leaving?
It's a fake.
Tom is very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What's going to happen to Tom?
I hope you don't catch a cold.
He's in a bird.
Tom will be released on Monday.
Oh, come on!
I have to move on.
She had a nose on the glass.
In English, the verb is not different.
I know exactly what to do.
It's very secret.
You have an excellent English.
Do you have any messages for me?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
It's very dangerous to write SMS by driving a car.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary wouldn't win.
Why did you shave your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How many pens do you have?
The worm was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
You asked Tom to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he has to talk to me.
I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.
We'll have a few guests tonight.
Her voice is still ringing in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time is healing.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't let it go.
Why don't we have dinner at the restaurant tonight?
Some birds didn't fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you about?
I told Tom you came to Australia.
You were looking for this?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where should I wait for you?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were caught in a snow storm.
The book is on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What do we lose?
You better ask him first.
He was fired against his will.
Take them to the hospital.
Did Tom tell you where he bought his pipe?
She never answered his letter.
I hired someone to work today.
Stop being a fool!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm on the stairs.
It's the biggest car in the world.
Tom almost never asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me that's not how Mary does it.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I already did.
What's the weather?
I sent her a message.
You owe me $300.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You're not gonna introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She was crying.
I told Tom that Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living out of town?
How long did it take you to do that?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's leader.
Who are you planning on going to Australia with?
Someone was screaming.
What's better?
We are grateful for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell Tom to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train is leaving at 3: 30.
I know you're hiding something.
Get the animals out of the cage.
He's afraid of cats.
You look like your father.
George is five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you're told.
Please, look at this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't look at your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're a lot higher than Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on his son's birth.
Mary says she needs more time.
The fodder got away from the door.
My dad's an English teacher.
For Christmas, Tom and Mary gave their grandson a bike.
Hold on to the rails.
Did you do that?
I'd like you to translate this into French.
How many glasses are on the table?
The lawyer has strong evidence that she's innocent.
Maybe.
I don't love Tom anymore.
Who's Tom with?
Taro has a strong sense of responsibility.
We both saw him.
We have a duty to help.
Tom just got out of prison.
You told Tom?
Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I have a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did all this.
I don't want to listen to your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
It is only in philosophy that a vicious circle of evidence can be used and appreciated.
I can't afford to have children.
When I approached them in French in Paris, they were just staring at me, and they never made them understand their own language.
Should I go?
I was so stupid I believed it.
She really did.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
My mother must be mad.
White bread, please.
The owls are nice.
Tom is illiterate.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We're perfect for each other.
French is complicated, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger is over.
We need more firewood.
Tom said Mary was irritated.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he does.
He must miss her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris far?
What time is it in Tokyo?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Calo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming today.
You become a father, you understand.
Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where did you get your shoes off?
We went to the beach.
Do you think there's gonna be snow for Christmas this year?
How was Tom's party?
I have to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from one of my friends.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me as well.
I'd like a coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth in a while.
You're the only one here that likes Tom.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't have a second chance like that.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All the bills have to be paid to me.
She was clapping.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom's dragging Mary by the hair.
Tom didn't seem happy to me.
When I grow up, I want to be a fireman.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
We forgot to sign up!
Tom said he liked it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the lazy one I know.
Did Mary get out of her room yet?
I'll forgive him this time.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a sober.
Alvaro is from Venezuela.
Here's the bill.
He insulted me in public.
Tom won't win again.
Why don't I stay with you?
In the induction plates, magnets are used to heat the bonnet and the straps directly.
I cried.
Tom wants to learn to play the trombone.
Come out now.
May I have a look at your rights?
I'll take 1,000 pesetas from you to replace the lightning on those jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot the sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I didn't know where to start.
That's a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I should have gone to Australia with you.
Tom's been drinking pancakes.
He ordered a few letters from his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you wearing pajamas?
How much is it?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
A cup of rice weighs about a hundred and eighty grams.
I should have left Tom a note.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I've been waiting for Tom since half past three.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Did anyone else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom is kind.
She played a sonate.
You can write in any language you want. In Tateeba, all languages are equal.
The infection is in the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
One day you'll thank me.
Tom sometimes watches TV.
Am I ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I still have a bad idea.
Run, chickens!
I had a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I only fell asleep after 2: 00 in the morning.
Maria was not thirsty.
It wasn't as hard for him to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom up.
They say that movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late because of the heavy rain.
She seems to be healthy.
Tom was in a straw hat.
Keep an eye on your brother.
Tom said he wasn't gonna wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter peppers.
What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do it together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There's no such thing as invincible.
Tom's winning.
I don't know what you're saying.
I know Tom can paint.
They're pimped.
I didn't know it would be impossible.
Are you having fun?
A man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow last night?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you try it on?
Does Tom know French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to go.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom gave Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the beast.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary in self-defence.
What is the difference between faith and trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you find out?
If the weather permits, we'll be on the top of the mountain tomorrow.
We both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve a problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of God Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it seemed.
His gray eyes were glow and screamed, and his usually pale face was reborn and covered with a rugby.
What kind of pizza do you like most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take some more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were shiny from the cold.
You want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed a lot of houses.
This man was doomed to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Can anyone speak French here?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I can't wait to see you.
Why are you wearing my shoes?
The power is in Tom's hands.
I learned to study and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's going to blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Children like to play more than learn.
He was found to be his little brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone's telling me I look like my father.
Guess what language I'm speaking.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is that red or white?
We're not afraid of fighting.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Come on!
Do it before it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
Did the mustache suddenly get into fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend that much time.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born the day before yesterday.
Tom's pirate suit.
It's a clean truth!
Let's go get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
The job is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom should be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll help you.
We are proud of our achievement.
Tom should have invited Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not a girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop hitting a cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know this man is who he thinks he is?
King Harald Gormsson, more known as Harald Sinezube, introduced Christianity into Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't go into this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read Herman Gesse.
To be honest, I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal cases come to trial, it is common for the jury to have 12 persons.
What exactly was Tom doing at the Australian Embassy?
Tom and I started dating.
The boys were marching four in a row.
Tom was very confused.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very sour.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was gonna do it.
It's been another day.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.
I have mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, come on, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you following your weight?
Tom's playing the trombone.
You're from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You might not be able to do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald's world-famous hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a dear gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like those perfume?
The lock's broken.
The diamond is a precious stone.
Help yourself to the cookies, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Stand down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want what's best.
Tom's a waiter.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why are so many people suffering from underself-esteem?
Was it too easy?
What Alice was faced with, waiting for an answer, was a sudden warrior. It was a thick noise, so sharp, to break her drumstick, and so loud to reach the sky.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he entered the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
You can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get the things into the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom gave Mary the money she asked him for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine's broken.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I was trying to solve the problem in vain.
You were supposed to do your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy, I couldn't lift it up.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
As soon as he's out, he'll be back.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried a banana pie?
The girl who gave me the beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
He's your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to the children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey's on the tree.
The language I teach is very complicated.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
You really live alone?
I told you I'd come back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president's been ruling for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Can you solve this?
Both Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
It's in the 20-floor building.
If you're not coming, I'm not going either.
You don't know when Tom's coming back, do you?
I don't have any pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a little bit?
Are you gonna give Tom something for Christmas?
She's not gonna fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would be a rich man right now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the courage to try and jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time are you planning on being home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you okay?
He's as stubborn as an ass.
I think you can be relied on.
She knew she was wrong.
It's so cool!
Tom had a feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I came home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say it again!
I called him, but some girl took the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she would win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very hard on the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I'm mixing mayonnaise with ketchup.
They always complain.
Tom's got a little moustache.
Do you understand what she said?
You're a little distracted.
Don't get her.
I'd rather stay.
That's a brilliant idea for Tom.
She's resting right now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place safe?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's all right.
She always keeps her room clean and clean.
I suspect Tom should go to Boston next week.
Don't go on other people's land.
Tom was terrified.
Tom's face is blushing.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where are you and Tom staying?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done here.
How's your new class?
Be afraid of your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
We need a new curtains in the room.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
It looks like he's sleeping.
You sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs were sick.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to talk to you about something important for both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom came forward and kissed Mary.
Did Tom swim?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it often.
I hope we don't do it again.
How many times have you been helping Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dance with Mary.
By the time I get there, there'll be time for opening.
I'm not sure what size it is.
He was also good to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as it stops raining.
The fodder's back from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help but think about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
He and I were crying.
Would you like to try it again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you dressed like that?
You can make oil, cheese, and a lot of other things from milk.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
You're her relative?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was gonna buy a new pair of shoes for her little daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I've been smoking before.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uncalled guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He wink back.

You didn't think to ask Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
No one's hungry but me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowflake in the snow lava thinks it's his fault.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I will solve this problem.

Look at him.
Will it hurt?
The girl had a big red hat.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was deceived.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who's Tom playing with?
I need a light coat.

It's a very bad idea.

Tom rarely goes to parties.
You're not my mother.
Tell them we're on our way.
Do I look like a guy who wants to get married?
I closed the door, but I didn't lock it.
He should be careful not to kiss Mary in public.
Are we gonna help them?
Thanks for calling me back.
They're happy.
Please don't be so hard on me.
I'm in charge now!

Are you looking for someone?

Tom said he saw a UFO.

Some are convinced that they are protected by the guardian angel.
Tom emptied his bank account.
She's at the hotel now.
What's going to happen to me?
He was so interested that he had given it his attention.

They're fake.
When you came back, I left.
Did you talk to him today?

Is that sarcasm?
Don't do what you'll regret.
Are you jealous of her?
I hope I can stay here a long time.
Payment will be based on experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to do sports.

There's a trade area.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your fist.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.
That's interesting news.
Tom is a bitter drunk.
We don't even know her.

I know where you hide your money.
The school is finally over.
It's a long pencil.
Does your mother know about this?

Write a pencil, please.
We can't leave.

I had no idea you could do that.
Tom unloaded the car.
Tom knew something about Mary that John didn't.
There's no answer.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I had a bad head.
Tom, you got a call.
You promised you wouldn't drink today.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Go see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he'd come back.
What time are you coming tomorrow?
A box of holes.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
Is that a bat?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me what else I need to know.
You can't make me marry you.
It's pretty weird.
The leaves are yellow.
I woke up and she's gone.
We have a lot of food today.

I'm not going to complain.
They kept their love secret.
She was only in a hurry to the station to be late for the train.

Although I felt something strange, I didn't know what it was.
Are you a pig?
I joined the army.
Why can't you take me as I am?
The bear is black.
Tom still doesn't know what Mary did.
I don't know who's gonna be at the meeting.
It's hard to get to the president.
If you're hungry, eat.
I was so scared.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll take care of it right away.
I don't trust her.
Six three is 18.
"Scala" is an anagram of "lasky."
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
Dan took part in the anti-racism meeting.
You did it fast.
I need to set the clock two minutes ahead.

It's not surprising.
The bunny is bleeding out of his ear.
Postmoderism is different from modernism.

He said he'd be back right now.
They have a lot of information.
Everyone in the village called her Green Hood.
I don't want to.
It's time to put the kids to bed.
It's a job you can get rid of.
I'm going to rest.

There's nothing.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
Did you take the cure?
Many people believe in the corruption of our country's officials.

That's good news.
I can't pay you.
That's what I found in the cave.
I think I made an impression on him.
The train is at this station for about two minutes.
Rise, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
Where do you think the safest place would be?
I know your father.
I heard you screaming.
He's the boy who drew that picture.
Call up means calling on the phone.
Who would have noticed?

I didn't expect Tom and Mary to be here.
Last night, the temperature went down to zero.
"You can't wear that." "Why not?"
Tom didn't do well.
I knew Tom wasn't in Australia.
My eyes are an ocean that reflects my dreams.
In a city as big as Tokyo, I prefer to walk, not drive.
As it turns out here, it's impossible to know.
Now Tom has his own room.
I didn't recognize her first.
A lot of votes have been fabricated.

I know that for sure.
Be an adult, Tom.

They can't afford it.
What color do you like?
She says she feels very tired.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know how Iraq is different from Iran.
They told him not to.
Two days ago, I caught a cold.
I was waiting for him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's have a drink at that coffee shop or something.
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom, he'll tell you the same thing.
I saw that helicopter, and I started waving with my hands.
I'm with you.
You want to end up like him?
I've been thinking about him.
I'm waiting for someone.
You're going to the theater tonight?
You have to protect yourself.
There's no air-conditioning in my house.
Tom and Mary study French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his offer.
I admire your courage.
Tom was hoping that Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do it again.
It's your turn, Bashar!
You're not a gift.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I went to Boston.
I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?
What do you think they're gonna do to Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary does.
I don't want anyone to do that.
Tom will be working this weekend.
Please tell her I called.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
The President & apos; s attempts to exercise more control over weapons have been prevented once and for all by powerful arms lobbies.
I think we know each other.
You underestimate Tom.
Don't be so mean to Tom.
I'll try to express it in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
You have enough time.
We had to plan more carefully.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud that my father is a good cook.
Is there something else you want to tell me?
Thomas tried to explain Masha's situation.

He's her manager.
Tom didn't have it.
No one was paying attention to me.
That was 13 at the time.
I'm going to Boston on a bus.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay up front.
You made coffee?
You could have told the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
Get yourself a decent suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
That's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom was hiding the fact that he was in prison.
We're fighting for Spartacus!
That's how he made his celebration.
Why would Tom want him?
It's a capital investment.
The truth is bitter.
There's no time for that.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
Promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
The net, the resupply.
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've read it before.
It's thanks to you.
As long as certain conditions are met.
She's not like everyone else.
Social networks provide a lot of information about a person before they meet him.
What really happened last weekend in Boston?
What's the point of learning?
These peaches are not very sweet.
I don't think these ink spots can be pulled out.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay.
I can't forgive his lazy.
Tell me you're kidding!
I'm a realist.
I heard Tom was expelled from school.
Tom said he was very alone.
I didn't tell my friends I was going to Australia.

Tom just wanted to make sure that's what you meant.
Tom sent her daughter to bed without dinner.
I'm coming with you.
They cleared the street of the snow.
Tom and Mary have to do this together.
They offered us their help.
Tom decided to kiss Masha.
Are you very hungry?
What's going to happen to him?
Tom and I are good friends.
Where do you think you're going?
I had blood in my urine.
You can't always win.
Tom is kind of famous.
Jimmy knows everything about cars.
I saw them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The painting is on the wall.
Mary said she would win.
I want that dog.
Is Tom with you?
The boy is afraid of the dark.
I made Tom dinner.
Russia has become the second superpower.
I'm worried about them, too.
He went to the post office to send a letter.
Spread this powder in a cup of water.
Will you go with her?
Let's take one of those ready-to-eat dinners that are being sold at the station.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go abroad?
Don't blame the government.
Put him where he is.
How come you know each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop the guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent for an apartment in Manhattan is about $4,000 per month.
You won't find them.
Tom is the only one who survived.
Are you going to buy this car?
You sound like my grandmother.
I don't have any brothers.
Let's see something else.
You think this is an exact translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both wanted to eat.
There's nothing to do with that.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
You have to take his age into account.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you don't like pizza.
Tom started to suspect something was wrong.
What if he comes back now?
If you're tired, sleep!
I'm afraid I won't have time.
You didn't know Mary was Tom's wife?
I have to move on.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
We're going to lunch on Friday.
What's your dad's name?
You're not gonna turn off the radio?
I don't really remember what Tom said.
Tom is an artificial player.
I wasn't ready for that.
Look at that girl.
Tom has a living imagination.
He's got a broken neck.
What are you saying?

Choose your words.
He just got back.

Don't make me lose my patience.
I love a lot of things.
I don't think you should do this on your own.
Tom is really dangerous.
It's not his wife.
We're not going to be here anymore.
How much longer do I have to wait?
I don't think I need anyone's permission to do that.
I need to find her.
We needed Tom's help.
Breathe through your nose.
Look at that from her point of view.
Tom was the only one who didn't swim.

I thought you'd be busy.
Can we wait here?
You're impartial.
Tom brushes his teeth at least three times a day.
Tom was good at talking to women.
Let's find our location before we move on.
She called me the next day.
Tom sold his car to Mary for $300.
What did that mean?
You should have told me in advance.
I have a rat in my garden.
He's looking for a job.
I'm looking for my cat.
I should have asked her first.
Enjoy the moment!
Who ate all the cookies?
We'll fix it.

The worst enemy and the best friend of man is another man.
Tom wanted Mary to make him something to eat.
Don't wait for me for dinner.
Tom didn't want to wait.
I'm sorry, I'll be back for a second.
We didn't ask.
Tom knew what had to be done.
I know that's not gonna happen today.
I don't think that changes anything.
We had a vacation on the lake.
I didn't know who you were.
She's reading her favorite book.
Tom had a nice smile.
Rabbits can swim.
I have some money with me.

I have one question for you.
It's 10 minutes from here.
Who are you to decide that?
Rise the cat.
Tom's a little busy, so he can't help you today.

Go and ask him.
Let me take a look.
Private charity is just a drop in the sea.

Why did you shave the beard?
These manual work items are of different quality.

Tom's not used to this kind of work.
She's suffering from kidney failure.
Give me the flashlight.
Did you tell Tom he shouldn't go?
In the summer, nothing is like ice cream.
I saw her play the piano.
I knew Tom wouldn't go.
Do you like driving?
The car didn't move.
Mary knows she was wrong.
This skirt is a little too tight.
Let's try to stay calm.
Tom's in the park with his friends.
She was talking fast.
You shouldn't have lied to Mary.
The baby's in the cradle.
I didn't tell them you were here.
Tom erased the offer and rewrote it.
You could have been hurt.
Get out of this room.
You don't have to smoke while you're working.
Tom wanted to play poker with us, but Mary didn't let him.
Tom hasn't done anything all week, just complaining about Mary's cooking.
I think the car's already broken enough, I can't do anything with my bare hands.
Did Tom approve?
I'd like to be Canadian.
It only happens sometimes.
We all pray for Japan.
No one wanted to talk about my country.
Just call me.
Why can't you go to Boston?
You're free to do whatever you want with your money.
Is there anything you want?
She left before I came home.
Tom wasn't the only one who was arrested.
You could at least knock!
You're making things worse.
I think you should get some rest.
He's a good man.
I cannot guarantee that we will be able to complete our work by next Monday.
I didn't do it very well.
Tom needs you very much.
I appreciate her loyalty.
Papiamento is a beautiful language.
I don't want to cut my hair.
I believe in love at first sight.
Do you remember their name?
I'm eating kuskus.
I didn't wait for them.
Tom changed his mind again.
I'd like to talk to you alone.
I thought you weren't seeing him anymore.
This magazine is good for sale.
Her clothes got a lot of attention at the party.
They're getting married tomorrow.
She was right, and he was wrong.
They drew lots of people to go first.
Maybe we should ask him the way.
Luckily, it worked.
Tom won't call.
He said he was cold.
I like spending time with friends.
I didn't know you were Canadian.
If you bring the child out and show him your finger on the moon, the child will look at the moon, and if you do the same with the dog, she will look at your finger.
Tom took a beer.
Tom didn't want to explain anything.
I'm sure I've never seen her before.
I didn't know who else to call.
I didn't know how unhappy Tom was.
She was born on April 4, 1940.
At the end of this year, there will be an economic crisis.
Don't let anyone near the fire.
You didn't know them, did you?
Tom showed Mary the letter he got from John.

I want one, too.
Tom once taught me French.
Where did Tom get that coat?
Don't forget to close the windows.
Can it be acceptable to you?
How am I gonna get to work?
Tom says he's gonna fix it.
I suggest you put a comma here.
This news is new to me.
Tom wants you to help him do this.
She's on a very tight schedule.
Tom speaks French, too.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
There were tiger lilies in the garden.
I told her not to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
We came to wish you luck.
Do you remember his name?
Tom put the toys in the toy box.
I don't want you to go.
He said he was coming.
"Doctor, I'm being ignored." "Next!"
He's got one goal in his life to make money.
He gave the dog a piece of meat.
A letter for you.
Grandpa Tom couldn't read.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a teacher.
She said she liked him.
Do I have to go with you?
Give him the microphone.
Tom was at the hotel.
I explained it to her.
Tom is undetermined.
Batton Yadreen!
I'll postpone my departure if it rains.
It has to be perfect.
There's something else I want to talk to you about.
It's the highest building I've ever seen.
It cuts my hearing.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Are you a musician?

The operation was successful.
How long will Tom be in the hospital?

What are you doing in my room?
We miss Tom so much.
He responded to his parents.
Tom, have you eaten yet?
Who did you give it to?
I held him by the collar.
No one's asking you to do that.
I forgot it was April 1st.
Please stop singing that song!

I know you left early.
Tom's been doing this all morning.
I understand the consequences.

If you heat the ice, it melts.
We could have done it.

When and where did you and Tom meet?
I came to visit you.
I feel like an amyoboy.
Our team came home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married a big girl.
I was listening to him.
What are you up to?
He came to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you crying.
Show me how to do it!
Everybody's not talking.
Let the dust lie down.
Why are you so stubborn?

I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use a phone.
Tom's better at cooking than I am.
He's swimming like an axe.
Tom didn't tell Mary what he needed to buy.
She brought a broom.
"Tom, hurry." "I'm coming!"

He likes to brag about his father's successful car business.
She's wearing sunglasses.

Take off your jacket if you're warm.
There are so many.
It could not have been a principle.
Mary says she's alone.
It's probably gonna take you three hours to do that.
It was an easy decision.
Mary said she'd be here early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
You still buying lottery tickets?
It could be anyone.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom is gifted by a rich imagination.
Finally, it has solved this problem.
The important thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I didn't have any bad thoughts.
Tom's keeping his room clean.
These three books belong to Tom.
He was moving from one topic to another.
It's a truce.
You told him I was here?
Tom goes inside.
It's not cold today.
I was wrong to put Tom's shirt on.
It looks like a bank robbery was planned up to a little bit.
He didn't like him, but he still bought him.
Have a little time.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank is empty.
Why didn't you show it to Tom?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was swimming in the river.
Tell them to pick up the phone.
Can you tell us what this is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a butcher, right?
Don't make me kill you!
Which one do you like more, this one or that one?
They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't make us angry.
You don't have to answer that.
Tom has a lot of books.
Can you distinguish the alligator from the crocodile?

He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
All right, everybody, listen up, please.
Is it made of wood or metal?
I'm sorry!

When we expect to remain ignorant and free, the nation is counting on what never happened and never will be.

Does Tom know you can't speak French?
There are two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna give you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be alone than in a bad company.
These are the wrong data.
There is a significant difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom's lazy.
We need to tell Tom not to do that anymore.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's making a look.
Come closer.
We're staying at the Hilton Hotel.
It's worth telling Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She always complained that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
Something needs to be done.
She gave him a present.
Mary's in her room.
Attention, everyone!
That's the second I fell in love with that language.
Tom's safe, right?
Did you order that pizza?
I need you to help me with that.
Tom is a close friend of mine.
Don't do two things at the same time.
You shouldn't have gone to the woods alone.
No one can see my tears.
Tom was asleep again.
She really likes you.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are refillable.
Tom's never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you came by.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm very happy to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last fall.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everyone knows we didn't do it.
I thought Tom was never in Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five.
We made a complaint to the control officer about the noise in the neighbors.
I'm not gonna let you do that.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need this.
Honesty is one of the virtues.
When you meet a new year, you'll spend it.
There's no French book in the library.
Any generalization is dangerous, especially this.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write that in a cunt, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you like I do.
Act like you're an age.
Do you know how to juggle?
You killed your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they weren't coming.
I can't bear the kind of animal suffering.

I think Tom's right.
It's a little dull.
Do you see the star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the rope!
You used to say that a lot.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been like that.

He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I'm very sorry about Tom.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
The documents are on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
Tom didn't tell us why he was so upset.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I don't work today.
That's what you said last time.
I know that better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
You have nothing to hide, don't you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The account should be paid by the first number of the following month.
My French is terrible.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
For me, Boston is a cold city, not like Chicago.
Tom was a victim of an attempted extortion.
I can't speak for my colleagues.
Does Tom live far from you?
Why didn't I die?
The fight ended in a fight.
I didn't take it, you can check your pockets.
Tom came in last night.
I'd like to leave a review.
You chose the wrong man.
They took a great risk.
We have a white cat.
Maybe you can never walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home last night?
If anyone can do that, Tom.

I don't think Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
Tom wasn't easy to find.
Everybody's dancing!
I live with Tom.
That's where I met them.
You're not wasting your time.
Your problem is you don't have enough patience.
Several events marked the twenty-first century.
Stop doing that, Tom.
Tom said he didn't plan on doing it.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told Tom to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said there's no such thing as that.
He's out of bed.
The trains are on schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think it's impossible not to be confused in languages.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Is the exam going to be today?
What's motivating you?
I gave Leila my computer.
Roll up your sleeves.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom will agree to meet us?
They say anyone in America can be president, but they probably don't.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first one on the list is Tom's name.
What else did you miss?
Mary tried to calm down.
What time does the train arrive?
What time does this train arrive in Boston?
You didn't see that?
You need to call me.
Tom never knew Mary and John had met each other.
When I get rich, I'll buy a farm.
I made him some cookies.
It's a neighbouring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come last night?
Where can I sit?
You're not gonna believe what Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Could you translate this into French, please?
Take the cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd was growing rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
It was Tom who told me what happened.
Cosie and get it.
I'll find her.
Have you thought about what I said?
I'm very sensitive to the cold.
We're looking for you!
She's loved by everyone.
Compare your answers to Tom's.
Tom has a weak heart.
Tom's gonna have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his barebeard.
Have you seen my dog?
Don't even try to do it on your own.
No one saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he's gonna fix it.
You have to come back.
We already talked.
I can't believe I finally made it.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, the test is easy.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know which book to choose.
Tom didn't get it at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
It's a tower.
I'm gonna have to wait.
It was Sunday last night, not Saturday.
Does anyone here know them?
They're watching you.
How long do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
We can do that.
He knows his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's wearing a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There's a lot of big things in this town.
What are you talking about?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They were sleeping in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't make people do this.
Let me carry it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand that color.
Are they sleeping together?
We are very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still not married.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
The neighbors have complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She's got a flaw.
I wonder why Tom would want this.
It seems suspicious to me.
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom's not the only one in Boston.
Will you support me?
What do you not like about this plan?
I thought you were at work.
It's up to you to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
A friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
The winter will be over soon.
Titles and awards don't mean anything to me.
Where did you even find him?
It's been a long time.
I recognize you.
Have you had a good day off?
Tom's drinking beer.
You don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring Tom a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Get it together!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we're gonna get lost.
I can't call him home.
You should have apologized to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxi driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom seems optimistic.
He's not going to buy a camera.
I did everything I could to help Tom.
I'm connecting you to her.
She's got the highest grades.
Tom can be jealous.
I think you're gonna be very busy tonight.
What color are you associated with your childhood?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the public.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of an underground docrat.
I'd like to lie down.
Give me the notes or something.
I want to relax before the TV tonight, I don't want to leave the house.
He'll be here today.
The cat is dead.
It's only half-nine now?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's not safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my finger last night.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me today.
Tom doesn't look very good.
She blew on her hands to warm them up.
Tom said I'm glad you're back.
My car is covered in blue shit.
Tom doesn't know I exist.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Is Laurie home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I'm not making that mistake anymore.
I don't care if we stay.
I got her to marry him.
I've been waiting my whole life for this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane went into the clot.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any e-mails in Indonesia?
You might have to help her.
Mary passed out.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come to a concert with me?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd love to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrella?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do that for you.
"Hey," Tom said.
Where are you going?
I almost died last night.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the censor.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new sentence as a message in a bottle, one day they'll translate it.
You're not gonna find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
He and I are soul mates.
I have a granddaughter of your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She started to get into her new office.
Let us take care of this.
I believe you're sitting in my seat.
I was planning on doing it yesterday.
It's a little early to drink alcohol, isn't it?
My parents don't like my way of getting dressed.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
It'll be interesting.
I hit him hard and hard.
Is that worse?
It's not expensive.
Can I take your hand?
It's green.
Tom heard a noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom hasn't been down all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about a cellulite.
The series needs to start watching when all the seasons are off!
Road accidents occur on a daily basis.
Where did you go skiing?
You were at the hairdresser's?
The prospect is disgraceful.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ball pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept in two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Get lost.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a picture together.
I failed at the exam.
Everyone already knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The football player made a huge mistake.
Are they coming, too?
She's sleeping like a baby.
Tom forgot to let the brakes go.
This song reminds me of a girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The explosion shocked the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hugged.
It's my cat.
Do you have any children yet?
Tom didn't want to have breakfast.
Tom likes them.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is an arrogant idiot.
It doesn't let me sleep at night.
He's been transferred to another department.
I think you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom thinks it's a sin to throw away food.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place is on the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about this yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom's a scotch.
Was it hard?
He's responding.
It's the sweetest thing I've ever met.
How much did it cost?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I used to be.
Do you know the boy who's crying?
No one knew about it.
It's just amazing.
He said he would never do that.
The one who stole the pin would steal the cow.
Tom doesn't swim very well, does he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just a shadow of his past.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
It happens all the time.
What day is it today?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to take me as I am.
I'm just a guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily on the lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he was coming with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I have to stick together.
I've only heard good things about him.
I don't work here anymore.
What do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You can't be the same as us.
I saw the car exploded.
The window is here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I will never throw away my PlayStation.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Stay still!
What's your favorite TV show?
You want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's on fire!
I'm afraid you'll be lost.
I like to go to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
The dog is yours.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm going to visit his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't mean to bother him.
The officer made his men bravery.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking of trying things like this right now.
I don't know much about hunting.
It's the first time I've been making meat at home on grill.
You're avoiding me.
Why would they do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he thought it was important.
How much do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
It was already known to all of us.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe that's what she said.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw the way he looked at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom should be home.
She was the one I thought she was.
Tom showed the police his driver's license.
I get a haircut every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an apple of acid.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalogue.
It must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
You're taking a job at home?
According to mythology, Prometheus has stolen the holy fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All the passengers were able to get out of the bus before it was set on fire.
I want to help you figure it out.
You speak French better than me.
There are a lot of talented people in our city, but Tom doesn't apply to them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're taking checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars were in the night sky.
I doubt Tom will win.
"Oh, it's so boring." "The boy is all about this world." "That's me." "Your Majesty, Ganon and his employees have taken the island of Coridai." "And" The sword is no.

I asked Tom to come with me.
We stopped him.
I don't think Tom can be left alone.
Religion won't let me.
As far as I know, he wasn't involved in this scam.
The fom was killed by lightning.
We don't know what Tom and Mary know.
I want to be happy.
You'll be lost.
We've seen it before.
How many pair of socks did you buy?
We never leave hope.
What happened to the book I put here last night?
Not to mention the price, that dress doesn't suit me.
I want to know who started it.
I didn't think I'd be punished.
Write it down with a pencil.
We didn't build it.
You'd better go help him.
Is that okay?
They're selling tickets to the Shakira concert tomorrow morning.
It was better today.
I know Tom is a brave man.
I got married early.
It's not a bug.
I don't want to scare you.
Tom told me Mary wouldn't want to go.
Have you talked to the doctors yet?
No one saw that.
Mary is an outstanding artist.
I think he's right.
Everyone loves money.
They're lost in the woods.
When was the last time you ate?
My heart hurts.
My father won't let me go to the movies alone.
I saw the boat drowning.
Instead of going to work, I've been sitting all day at home.
I'll support you.
I didn't talk to Tom.
They decided to work harder.
It's not for sale.
Who are your neighbors?
My father usually watches TV after dinner.
He's drinking wine.
Please cut off your apple pie, I made it for you.
I don't think Tom understood the question.
You have to stop her.
You'll be on time if you get out now.
There was no special problem with Tom.
The darkness didn't cover it up.
I invited him to dinner.
I'm sure it'll be easy to find a place.
I took two aspirin pills from the headache.
You're in my heart.
He turned me to the last penny.
Don't laugh!
Love does not obey anyone.
If you come to Tom now, you'll probably make him watch TV.
I saw you in the park with Tom.
I didn't mean to hurt them.
I'd better go look for them.
My motorcycle broke on the way.
Tom made a selfie without a shirt.
In whose kingdom was this church built?
We'll be able to put you in prison soon.
I'm starting to think you're serious.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sure Tom would be happy to help.
It's Joanna.
I've made so many mistakes.
How can people do such things?
Tom's really sorry.
I like your glasses.
The rain water is flowing through this pipe.
I always thought Tom was a close friend.
I'm the kind of girl who's more friends with guys.
Don't worry, I have insurance.
Tom will be here with me.
It's hard for my father to stop drinking.
No one's suggesting you do it.
He works for this company from Monday to Sunday.
Mary forgot to lock the car.
I'm old.
Tom left with Mary.
Tom started laughing.
I'll call Tom tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic powers.
Who is he by nationality?
Tom was in the same cell with John.
I didn't mean to swim.
He had a beer.
In this time, it's harder for a man to be... himself.
I'll never talk to him again.
Shhh, Tom, wake up!
I'll put my handkerchief away.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all children.
She went crazy and yelled at me.
Have you taken your medicine?
The prisoners are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
Time is on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
I doubt Tom's still angry.
You'll be better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell the slurry rubber?
That's not what happened here.
When's your father coming home?
I understand.
Tom extended Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of the shower.
Tom has a patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom will try to escape.
You're clearly tired.
We're champions.
Tom's going to take a breath.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to the party.
Her hair is wet from sweat.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much that weighs?
The flight attendant is a master of compliments.
Tom's married to Mary, right?
Every bench in the park was busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
I'm working on it.
Vermont is located on the border with Canada.
He had to live in the same room as his brother.
I'm not an imbecile.
You're gonna fix this, right?
I don't know how to hunt.
He has a brother in Tokyo.
It was invented by Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to intervene.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you want.
I know you shouldn't do that.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've already spoken to this student.
What is the chemical mark of the hydrochloric acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
Tom needs to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do it.
Cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a palace.
I respect his views, although I do not agree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the middle of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him up with a sweater.
I don't think Tom would want to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine, call me cheaper?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use it, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We had no chance of winning.
How long are you planning on staying?
We had a quick meal and then we left.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop a thing on your feet.
Start every meal with soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right across from me.
The caliber was open.
I brought some wine.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day of school.
I want to meet you to death.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I propose another strategy?
They're dead.
The apples are big.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about that.
Is she singing?
I have to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom was listening with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's go in the car.
You're interrupting me.
She was wondering what his lips would taste like.
A good coach is training this team.
The tree is sick.
The train was delayed because of the heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What makes you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
It was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you eat?
You don't recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning on doing it or not.
I'm falling.
I was unable to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom wears new shoes.
She learned how to ride a bike last year.
Help us.
You don't have to thank me.
Since he was in winter, he didn't go outside.
On the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses are on your street?
The elephants are made of ivory.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"What's up, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
Her mother tongue is French.
That coat is unfashionable.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
The only positive quality of the person is the nebula.
My hobby is an insect collection.
Tom lived in Boston as a child.
I haven't eaten in six days.
Can I tell them about this?
She's been quiet all day.
No matter what he can say, don't believe him.
I went on.
Tom and Mary hope their next child is a boy.
Mary's always very welcome, and she's got a nice smile.
I'm not gonna let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep under the cradle.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could have learned a lot from them if you only listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
I'm sorry I upset you.
Those who have never left their country are full of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it is when the snow falls.
Tom's helping his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I turned on my imagination.
I thought we could do that.
My mom was against me driving alone.
I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.
You know what you're doing, right?
The machine can't be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
This river is full of fish.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
She and I are the same age.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had those symptoms before?
The prisoner was released.
What did they say happened?
Can you leave the door open?
I'll have to wait with that.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows what he did was a mistake.
In Japan, the climate is soft.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced the injured player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip was very smooth.
It's inevitable that I'm going to France one day, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom just pretends to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
We can open the windows again.
It's never happened to me before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was going out when the phone called.
I don't have to take it.
Always give up on the right.
We're being asked to introduce ourselves in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like the rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a ride if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
You still got a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes as much as a hot bath.
I don't really have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot about that.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice is like a melody siren song for me.
How does it feel to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers left prints on the glass.
Chemistry is a great science.
I have a feeling my French isn't getting much better.
How do I best get a passport?
Maybe you can help Tom.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom hasn't paid attention to Mary all day.
Tom has fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
There's still light outside.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my father's car, but soon it'll be mine.
Did you forget his name?
If I had time to do it, I would.
You see Tom's boat?
A big picture?
This cure will help you.
Stop making noise.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how busy I was?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I have no one to trust.
She's a big-town sex fan.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
You should treat him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
How often do you have to do that?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing compared to a glass of beer after a long working day.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long will it take you?
Let's take a break here.
Are you wearing new shoes?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom said.
She was grieving the grimass when she saw the dog.
He's not above me at all.
Smoking is strictly prohibited.
That peach is beautiful.
Can you see that?
Tom doesn't like that.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
Good work!
You used to say that a lot.
Here's a few letters for you.
It is almost unthinkable that a scientist of this level would make such a fundamental mistake.
He has no evidence.
You don't look good.
He was very good at swimming when he was young.
I'm writing to a buddy.
He's very good at tennis.
She led the students astray.
She said she was Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when were you gonna tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I filled the pitcher.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it now.
What house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What are we living for?
Will it rain this afternoon?
We know about her.
You could have helped us.
I don't drive often.
Tom doesn't like the end of the movie.
Just get inside.
Just ask him for his forgiveness.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
You two make me sick.
I didn't know it was legal.
I like adventures.
Tom's in the library.
You were at school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you happy?
I've decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
There's gonna be a big snow fall tomorrow.
We decided to move the meeting to the next Sunday.
She thinks she can prove it.
When was the last time you played golf?
Are we poor?
I don't know Tom's name.
We have the same dentist.
Not all Brazilians like carnival.
I don't think Tom knows what's going on.
Who did Tom sell his car to?
Tom's frowning.
I have to make money so I can buy a computer.
Don't laugh at foreigners.
I don't know them.
If you could choose genes for your children, would you?
The one with Mary needs some rest.
He went to bed.
It could have been worse.
Tom made his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's keys are.
What book are you looking for?
I don't sleep much.
You'll get there one day.
Tom's good with Mary.
"You owe me money." "No, you don't."
He came up and got on his knees.
You don't have to go there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Tom did this for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom makes three times as much money as Mary.
I had milk.
It's gonna be snow tomorrow.
Isn't life wonderful?
When it comes to cooking, there's no one like Mary.
You haven't been yourself lately.
Tom lost his leg when the shark was attacked.
I made it for you.
We'll do it as time goes by.
I'll be three times your age next year.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your stamp collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom's not much older than Mary.
No one seems to know him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
This tissue is on your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's about winter.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up a professional guitar game.
I'm married now.
It was just a few times.
You've gone too far this time.
It's working.
You're going to see Tom before you leave?
It's no surprise, Tom said.
We want to rent an apartment in town.
They spoke French.
It's extremely expensive.
He's not singing anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They're still awake.
Tom's a couple inches above Mary.
I'm glad you suggested it.
It's hard to answer your question.
You don't believe her?
English is a world language.
That sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told Tom to leave Mary alone.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
Why would Tom need a hammer?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
She's divorced.
I'm not gonna let you take my kids.
Don't give it to him.
Run or they'll arrest you.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom made himself a rule to meditate every morning.
Did you check your calculations?
He tried to write a short story.
A room without books, like a body without a soul.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What does your brother do?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you in years.
I visited Tony last night.
It's easy to impress her.
You're old enough to do it on your own.
Aristotle thought the Earth was the center of the universe.
I wonder what Tom really meant.
No one understands me.
There are so many stars in the sky, I can't count them.
Everyone turned around and looked at us.
Let me see.
White bears live in the Arctic.
I told you I was the best.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't have to ask me to do something a few times.
Let's get the dishes washed today by someone who's gonna lose in the rock-scissors-paper!
I'm so unlucky!
I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He's fluent in Russian, at least that's what he told me.
Tom is a third-year-old.
Will you stay long?
I'm not a woman.
She has a tall father.
The train was overrun.
The house is red.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
You know Boston well, don't you?
The orchestra started playing.
Mary was in a pirate's suit.
It's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention it before?
Tom didn't want to be a snitch.
He was born at 7 a.m. on 5 June 1970.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are twins.
Tom only eats white meat.
Thanks for helping.
We only have three rules.
She bought one for herself.
Security didn't see Tom.
In recent years, Tom has been noticeably stagnated.
I helped carry those bags.
They have a lot of time.
Fifteen by five is seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know anymore.
You don't know what he's gonna say yet.
My hands are tired.
I lied to my wife all the time.
Finally, she did.
It's a flagrant irony that they were not insured from the fire.
We have a lot of money.
The examination was divided into two parts.
When are you gonna tell them?
Tom didn't want to talk about his illness.
Oh, you're so bored here!
The reading of the book is comparable to a journey.
Tom saw Mary go into the store.
Why aren't you there?
Tom said Mary would probably win.
A Japanese would never do that.
I miss Boston so much.
She writes letters all the time.
I don't know who to consult.
Turn left on the corner.
Tom taught me how to do it.
There's much more to be done.
Give me one, please.
I can't stand the unscrupulous children.
Tom bought this for me.
What you said made everyone angry.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for 30 years.
She showed her talents.
I wish it was possible.
I'm assuming you can't do this.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
At the next school festival, Bob will play a leading role for the first time.
You have to stay in shape.
I've been smashing seeds all day.
From the accent, I realized he was American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Have mercy!
Tom obeyed.
All the people of my generation think the same thing.
I live for it.
Do you know how to ski?
The Duke owns a lot of land.
Well, have fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's getting better.
You'll feel at home.
It won't end well!
He looked like he didn't eat for a few days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who is Norman Finkelstein?" "American Political Science."
Get out of here!
If it's not a home sale, maybe it's a new way to meet girls.
Tom picked up the coin.
Why didn't you clean up your room?
If there is no God, everything is allowed.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please put your seat belts on during the take-off and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both like seafood.
I've been waiting a long time for this.
I rejected the offer.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
It's gonna take me too long to explain why this won't work.
Nothing's changed.
You built this all on your own?
I look forward to summer leave.
Can I put that in a different way?
He looks great from here.
Wooden houses are easily burned.
Let's throw Tom a party.
The dog is still alive.
I go to university.
I know you lied.
The bed is very comfortable.
I'll report on it tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a whore.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait here for him to come.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know Mary's shoe size.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is José, we're friends.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do it without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who set up a meeting?
I'm such an unlucky guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have any fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in the skirt.
What bird can't fly?
That must end.
Tom didn't answer right away.
Tom died at age 70.
Life is a gift.
Tom speaks French as well.
The acquisition of the transistor marked a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you hear what she said about Alexi?
You look like a girl.
Here are some pictures.
What's on Channel 10?
I hate espionage.
My mother's making lunch.
Tom is a pilgrim.
What can I do?
Her son is a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's inclined to give the will to his emotions.
We were shocked to hear about his death.
Why didn't they go?
I didn't see you.
You just point out the obvious.
He had cancer.
It's your fault that this happened.
He's like a watch.
I know where you're going.
You're taking it all over the summer.
Let's move it.
Let's leave it until tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he's telling us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing that.
The janitor interrupted the conversation.
There's a cat on the written table.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not limping anymore.
Tom was a good smoker.
Tom's wearing gloves.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to this weather.
I wonder who will help him decorate the snowman.
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in soul mates?
What's that noise?
My son has an inheritance disease.
It's disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He put the glass down.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can marry your dog.
The best defense is an attack.
She's getting married this fall.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Is there anything we can do to help you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
The investigations began last year with the confiscation of a man's computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How you doing?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What makes you think you can't?
We were going back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe that?
Thank you for your correction.
Are you crazy?
The stars show up at night.
Where did Tom get that scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom is drowning his pencil.
Tom can't ride a bike.
I'm not talking to a teluga at all.
What did Tom leave for?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild animals.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed to tears.
I spent $500 in one day.
Tell them to go home.
Put it anywhere.
They didn't make it on time.
It's 7: 30.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who told Tom that.
Tom got up early to see the dawn.
The dinosaurs died a long time ago.
I usually go up the stairs in one.
Tom's had that year.
I'm at the station.
Tom is a very good boy.
Do you drink?
You're from Boston, right?
Put it on my desk.
Tom's out of the water.
I was very proud of that.
You were ready.
Do you know Tom's brother?
All lizards can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
I'm out of my hands today.
I asked them to stay away from this.
Tom only learned to drive at 30.
I'm glad he wasn't hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary were studying French.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen knife was not sharp enough to cut off the meat, so I used my pretzel knife.
Honey, I can explain.
You're about to adapt to the village life.
Keep a bucket of water next to you.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
There's a river deeper than that.
Thank you from the heart.
I've told you that a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
The writing of the words separately when they are to be written in bulk is a major problem in the Norwegian language.
What are you doing with the rest of the rice?
It's been ten years since she died.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Do you need anything else?
We left soon after.
This book should be read.
Tom and Mary took lessons before dinner.
I don't want to drink your tea.
You're always so romantic.
The wife's not a boot, you can't get off your feet.
I'll pick you up at 6: 00.
I teach Tom French.
I like to learn other languages.
Mary has brown eyes.
I'd like to know how long Tom plans to be in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
How did you feel?
Let's give Tom a chance.
I like fruit.
Tom lied.
He's a car dealer.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he's coming?" "I hope not."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate caviar.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check it out.
Tom gave Mary a gun.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They were the first to get on the bus.
Let's wait till Monday.
Does anyone know them here?
There must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to the smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you what time to come.
Of course, I kept my promise.
Our friendship remains strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get to the point.
Tom was sitting on the steps.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes lightning hits twice in one place.
I don't brag.
Leave it for later.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door unlocked.

I think I've known you my whole life.
I want Tom never to write my daughter again.
The rabbits are multiplying fast.
I don't want to talk about it right now.

When happiness knocks on your door.
You need to listen to her.
I'd like you to know how much you mean to me.
Mary's answering the teacher's question.
Tell me frankly.
I'll come to anything.
Do you mind making another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Honolulu.
You're not telling me anything I don't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left last.
Tom signed the application.
You tried to talk to Tom about it?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know so much about Tom.
How was your day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me time.
Do you want them to help?
You can't see Tom anywhere.
I told Tom to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruit.
Could you close the window?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
We can meet again in the near future.
The trees have calmed me down.
He's a butterfly.
I slept on my stomach.
Keep me posted.
You have the right to your opinion.
Mary told me she'd buy it.
I made breakfast.
I'd like to buy two stamps of forty-five cents, please.
I'll give you a bike for your birthday.
Tom started to suspect something was wrong.
Beer's got beer.
I don't think Tom's gonna like it.
I thought he was innocent.
I'll wait for you here.
I'd like you to talk to him.
I thought you said it was yours.
Tom's doing his research.
Look at that cat.
I'm divorced.
That's very interesting.
Don't be late.
That's what we're working on.
Everybody having fun?
Tom's watching a figure-on-TV ride.
We're gonna have to sleep on the street today.
Did Tom show Mary how to do it?
It's amazing, isn't it?
I've been grieving my face.
The school's only five minutes away.
Tom put a spoon in his pocket.
Is that the only thing you care about?
Do you see the rose?

I'd like to talk to Tom.
People often complain about the weather.
I just need you to sign this.
I felt something was wrong.
Tom took a beer.
I'll tell you what to do.
A man born in France is a French.
I'm not used to it.
It's a gift from her.
Do you have a house?
Don't feed the ducks.
Hey, it's me, could you pick me up at the station?
Now, tell me something about yourself.
Tom was the only one in the pool.
I study French on my own.
Tom couldn't answer all Mary's questions.
Tom is teaching my children French.
Tom says he hasn't eaten for three days.
It's not like Tom's having fun.
There are some distractions.
I should have told Tom to go there.
We're gonna finish it.
I know you're in love with Tom.
Dick gave me the picture.
You said you'd help her.
Did you really expect Tom to tell you the truth?
I couldn't look her in the face.
It could be by the way.
Someone sent us a present.
Tom and I have been married for three years.
It's hard to live with Tom, isn't it?
Have you ever seen Tom dance?
Tom asked me for advice.
Tom started crying.
Put a blink on her.
He would never lie to me.
She wasn't sick.
I was trying to be nice.
He deliberately missed me so he wouldn't kill me.
You think I'd change my mind?
Tom is an Australian citizen.
You bought them?
Tom just looked at Mary and smiled.
I gave them my old coat.
Tom volunteered to help Mary.
Are you a liberal or a conservative?
We don't know exactly why this is happening.
The presence is mandatory.
He took a picture of Leila from his computer.
It was raining in Boston on Monday.
I just don't agree with you.
You can rely on the new president, can't you?

I forgot the money.
I'm on an 11-hour train.
I can't put you in my plans.
I broke it.
Did you tell Tom?
Tom and Mary know each other very well.
You bought a very expensive coat.
Scientists explain it differently.
What are you doing here?
Do Germans have other concerns in their lives than consumption?
Does she have any brothers or sisters?
Hey, what are you doing?
They're selling shoes.
The potatoes are very cheap.
Why?
This is my favorite project.
We don't have any water.
Would you like to introduce yourself?
Even if I drink, it doesn't affect how I drive.
Tom told me he'd stay home.
I lived in a three-room apartment when I was in Boston.
Don't look at this.
There's a bus stop on the front of our school.
It's definitely over 30.
Tom was wearing a lollipop.
"Oh, I'm dying," said Pierette, falling on his knees. "Who will save me?"
After I got on the train, I noticed I left my wallet at home.
How long after Tom died?
You play guitar?
We hope we don't need to do this.
We have the situation under control.
Who's there?
Is it payday?
This is obviously inevitable.
It's your fault, not me.
I wanted everything.
We'll do it tomorrow.
You talk too much.
Don't trust him.
What search engine do you use?

There's nothing I could do for Tom.
I don't think I would have done that.
The door doesn't want to close.

I'm a Japanese student.
You don't have to eat that.
Well, I think it's time to tell the real story.
I haven't been singing in years.

Tom gave me that tie.
Why would Tom lie about his age?
Come half three, please.

I know you're not 18 yet.
I went to the shoe store last night.
We found out he was innocent.
Tom was the only one who didn't know Mary had moved to Boston.

I don't want to see you.
Keep your hands on the wheel.
He'll be playing tennis tomorrow afternoon.
I saw your rights.
I didn't give up hope.

She's too weak.
You can't eat here.
