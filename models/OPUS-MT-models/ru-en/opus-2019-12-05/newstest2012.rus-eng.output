Parliament does not support an amendment that gives Timoshenko freedom.
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in amending the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected an attempt to repeal an article that condemned the leader of the opposition, Yulia Timoshenko.
The amendment that would result in the release of the former Prime Minister in prison was rejected during the second reading of the bill on the commutation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be unprofitable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider Timoshenko's appeal in December.
Timoshenko claims that the sentence is the political revenge of the regime; in the West, the process was also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which condemned the former Prime Minister, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
Ratification would require 226 votes.
Libya's victory
In the history of liberation or uprising, Libya already has losers.
Muammar Qadhafi is buried somewhere in the desert, and the war is over without him.
It's time to identify the winners.
In general, Islamists win the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a member of the ordinary law of the Sharia, on which we have heard.
Libya will become a country without crime, as the punishment for theft is a cut-off.
Women may forget emancipation; potential opponents will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society of rival clans will be brought together by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we would not wish for.
In any case, our way of life is not the only one of its kind, or the best, and would probably not be appropriate, for example, for the people of Libya.
Indeed, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted assistance from the unbelievers.
Their only excuse is that, in their view, NATO's raids were not led by an American General, but by God, whose greatness they celebrated after every strike.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not one of them.
We were involved in the exchange of fire, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of benefit.
In view of the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to renounce the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, should not be concerned about the expulsion of "Crusaders."
Although without occupation, did the oil companies get Libya's black gold for almost no price?
And then the West will finally be able to take on the self-defense of civil rights.
Unless the followers of the Sharia put an end to it.
A new wave of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are now at the centre of investors' attention.
The statistical storm was over Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries reported GDP data in three quarters.
In comparison with the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a state of stagnation, with Germany and France showing growth.
And yet, the debt market today is on record.
Investors are not only looking towards Italy; they have now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European region countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have made public their preliminary assessments of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany & apos; s GDP increased by an expected 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, where Germany was better than expected (an increase of 0.3 per cent instead of the original 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (initial information was expected to be stagnated).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared with the previous quarter, GDP was in a state of stagnation, which, according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, confirmed the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key developments:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany & apos; s economy increased by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both the eurozone and the European Union showed an increase of 0.2 per cent from the previous quarter, which is consistent with the projections of analysts.
The Greek economy showed a preliminary reduction of 5.2%.
Its 10-year bond income is 28.45 per cent.
The income of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical point.
Even Austria, France, the Netherlands and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
While the situation in the region is deteriorating, the return of Czech 1-year bonds remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, it is said that the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech assembly was selected at the EURO.
In Montenegro, they won 1: 0 and celebrate an unexpected 200 million-dollar prize.
The national team has successfully completed the most difficult task of the season!
With the great Cheh and the beautiful goal of Peter Yirachek, they won with 1: 0.
In the second time, the Czech team was lucky to maintain a significant advantage after the home response, and will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz observed the match and prepared a detailed report.
Almost nothing significant in the first time and a great deal of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the great Cheh; and the heroic Yirachek; won 1: 0 in Montenegro and celebrates the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the team of Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damyanović and Vucinich were the most failed couple of matches after they missed two great opportunities.
The great Peter Cheh is one of the reasons why the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech football will make up about 200 million Czech kroner.
The game has been very tense since the first minutes.
Both teams were having difficulty doing the combinations; the game was most of the time in the middle of the field.
It also explains the lack of pressure from the host team in the first time, and the subsequent attacks on the defence line were carefully intercepted by Czech defence counsel.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a human shield.
Several hundred university students have created a living shield around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
In so doing, they wish to express their support for their country & apos; s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday, at noon, the prayers of the students were followed by the mosques of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students created a human shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They have thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country & apos; s nuclear programme at the cost of their own life.
In its most recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that it was clear that Iran had not left any attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday, at noon, after the students' prayers before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant, the molecules were followed by the death of both the US and Israel.
In the case of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysis of the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets will be, according to the Israeli press, the installations in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium is being enriched.
Nutrition of children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and no sausage for dinner
More than one third of children between 9 and 13 years of age weigh more; while 9 per cent of children are overweight, 5 per cent suffer from obesity.
According to the latest study, children suffering from obesity usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
We see once again the importance of the environment and the patterns of behaviour that accompany human beings for his or her healthy development.
For example, there are almost twice as many children on the table who are obesity-affected as in families with children of normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children suffering from obesity had been eating fries for dinner on the eve of an educational event called Eating is not an accident.
Moreover, the families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports, but most of the families of modern school children - only 15 per cent of the children say that their parents find time to engage in sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of the last school year and was attended by almost 900 primary school students across Bohemia.
The event was not an accident for the second year in a row, with the support of the insurance company Všeobecná zdravotní pojišīovna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 pupils in grades 4-8 have joined the project.
Adequate nutrition and sufficient sports are the main determinants of the rapidly growing number of children who are either overweight or obesity.
"For example, only half of the people interviewed said that they eat five times a day, according to breakfast-lunch-lunch-eat-dinner, which is one of the essential conditions for proper nutrition," said one of the findings of the study.
No lunch and no sausage at night.
Experts warn that even relative details such as the constant time of family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of school families have breakfast together.
In most families, everyone's having breakfast separately.
The worst discovery is that in every tenth family, people don't have breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of the right day's diet.
The study found that roasted food is more often used in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweet, cool drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children are regularly engaged in sports, this figure is more than halved, to 15 per cent, in the case of their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to draw up their own menu based on the products offered and based on their own taste and preferences.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from the ideal of healthy nutrition."
Their favorite food includes a lot of flour, meat and sweet food.
"Of particular concern is the high popularity of sweet, cool beverages," referred to in the final part of the study.
As the main meal, the paste won a bird with a small overweight.
However, children have shown little interest in beans, fish and vegetables.
A desire for a healthy way of life
The study also found that children were prepared to change their food habits, provided that information was provided.
"Many participants in the review team have shown a significant shift in the preference for healthy food when they completed the questionnaire after the lecture, Eating is not an accident," the outcome of the project.
This was particularly evident, for example, in the case of sweet, cool beverages - more children have just chosen water.
In addition, as a primary course, children were more likely to point to the bird and fish, limiting the number of sweet dishes and bathing.
The stylist should also be a good psychologist, as the professionals say.
In the first article on training for stylists, I visited the amount of information at the induction class.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three experts in this field; boards for the choice of clothing for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how this works in real life.
More.
The closer we are to the final examination, the more information and practical tasks we are expected.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time with Alenka, the director, (there's no man at all), we discussed how to wear a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not fully symmetrical.
One has a short neck, the other has a boy's figure without proper forms, and another weighs more.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce the broad shoulders, extend the neck or add the missing volumes.
We have been given advice on how to emphasize the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, that is, the women of the dearest breast and the thighs and the narrow waist, and not to wear them too much.
For example, if the difference in the volume of the waist and thigh is so large that you can't pick up the skirt or trousers, you should have at least one thing on the order.
You will certainly not regret the investment, because the perfect sitting clothes are priceless.
In the skirt, you'll feel a lot better than the one who's always moving out, running around, nudging the waist, etc.
On the other hand, the holders of the boys & apos; figures may wear clothing with hands, equipment, embroidery or storage.
Given the abundance of such information and the types of figures, I'm glad I have a whole week to realize all this.
And yet, I'm afraid that's too much, given the homework we got.
Each participant in the course had to come up with two sets for a celebrity, a day and a evening.
We have to take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothes and the type of figure.
I have to wear Miranda Kerr, which you can know from Victoria's Secret's advertising campaigns.
I'm happy about myself because it's a lot easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguiler, who's recently recovered to a ton (please know what I'm exaggerating), or very young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut out clothes from magazines or find them on the Internet, print and process them through graphic programmes.
Mudbard - so called the result of the work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It's important to keep a graphic part of the style in your head.
The stylist not only dresses real people but creates product pages in magazines (based on specific instructions such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenic told us.
But it was only Sunday.
The Stillist needs general knowledge.
The Saturday lecture, full of information on the types of figures, brought back three guests in the field.
Stylist, Honza Pokorna; fashion designer, Yakub Polanca; and fashion photographer Ben Rinch.
The Yakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a coat-coach can be worn in a normal way, above jeans and a T-shirt like a coat; but it can also be carried on a naked body, without a clamp, like a dress.
Another possibility is to roll up the sleeves or lift the collar, and the whole image is completely changing.
"Play with him," he stressed.
In any case, I most appreciate the following advice: "For your work, you must know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them, 'said Yakub.
I finally realized here why we're going to do all the definitions and rules that we're going to have to do with what and why, while in fashion magazines, we often see a whole different thing.
Not to mention fashion.
From Ben, the photographer, I found out that the stylist should have more options than the number of photos he needs to take.
So for a fashion view on 10 pages (equivalent to 10 sets), I have to be ready to create at least 15 images.
Now I also know that the picture often looks and works in combination with others in a way that is not the same as in reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pokorna has confirmed that image and style are often half a success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an amazing vocal, but her image and marketing turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even known people often think it's too much (and believe it's enough to be a specialist in something, and what they look like is secondary).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we have to expect them to give us a different size (less) than the one they really wear.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tabloids have written anything about some celebrity of the ceiling / thunder, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that there was not enough fashion for a stylist to know and be able to pick up a outfit.
Our job is mostly to communicate with the people we dress; it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to condone them, and to hold their opinions.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can't throw away her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are terrible."
"Find at least a few things you can praise, and advise that you can wear with them" says Mario.
He also showed us that he should have a working bag specifically.
It's a bag you tie around the waist to wear everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as scissors, sticky clip or English beetles, there must be nylon (stylists use it for some items, such as a bag or hat), special clips to hold the tissue on the back if the clothes are too large (buns and similar items are prohibited because they are ruining the clothes) or a sewing kit.
To get away from the lectures and get some practical experience, we learned how to make the right straps on the poles.
Even in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can be damaged - not to mention the shooting on the street.
And now we're doing a sticker.
You don't have to touch the shoes with scissors, not to ruin them.
It requires a real skill.
I was pleased that Mario had praised my work.
I didn't like those skills.
It's only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stylist is not as easy as they say.
V Need for Speed: The escape is taking place in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a carefree walk has become a routine morning trip to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and negligent mistakes.
Ambiations have been satisfied to some extent, but it doesn't matter, since no one clearly wanted to do too much work.
Before the new version, the sub-heading "Escape" had a great deal of hope.
It was expected to move the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; the demonstration versions indicated that the game would take a decent place in the genre of the race games.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main hero gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, in the end a lot is different from what we expected.
The game is a rather good arcade race, but the overall impression is a few unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for several years.
So, in fact, it's not a mistake, it's an expression of the inexplicable ribbon of the developers.
The adventure is starting very well.
You're part of a story that, Jack, is the main hero, is solving some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You get in the car on the west coast, San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
This idea has some interesting features.
The route consists of 10 stages divided into more than 50 races.
This means that each race is on its own route, and some steps are taking place in a different and interesting environment.
So there's no feeling that the game is the same all the time.
While the schedule is at the same level as in previous parts of the series, it is good to see some tracks.
And yet the game is not very emotional.
Although driving through the desert, it's very nice to be on the fall suburbs or high in the snow mountains.
And, in addition, the races, from time to time, revive an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert, you get into a sand storm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to get under the avalanche.
The individual races are rather well-organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while, you try to outstrip a few rivals (essentially a regular race); then you try to improve time (a standard race with a second); or you compete with one opponent.
Among other things, you come across the police from time to time, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack is running away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not that hard.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much less than you could expect (only three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for a game, because it's not a thing that's annoying; given all the above, it's one of the things that make a game more busy.
The race model follows from previous models.
It means it's no longer a special thing, but it can't be considered a lack.
If you're looking for a real life simulation, you're gonna have to look elsewhere.
And yet this driving model is very good for dynamic races, although better options can be found on the market.
So far, so good.
But after a while, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
You don't expect a game like this to be a complex change or a clash, but if you have no idea what's going on with the object, like your car does, something's wrong.
Usually, by driving or passing by cars in a dense stream, you sometimes touch another car a little bit, and yet sometimes in a very similar situation, your car starts to be furious.
Or the two of us broke up.
It's not important because of the relaunch system, but it's enough to ruin the fun.
The reruns are so that if you break up or go far off the track, the game brings you back to the point where it was interrupted.
However, only five relaunches are available for each race.
If you use all of them, you'll have to start the race from the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't work out, but you can't rely on it.
Sometimes it's not enough to relaunch, and you have to learn a separate section of the race.
The important disadvantage of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns have to go in a certain way, or you just don't fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars at a certain location in the same configuration, whether you come first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations where you see your rival moving easily between two cars moving in the opposite direction, while when you're there, the cars are already located so that you either have to cross them or drop the speed.
It doesn't matter when you're next to them; it's all arranged in such a way that the situation always happens just before your nose.
The rivals have other advantages as well.
During the game, you find a few places where, regardless of time, the same rival is overtaking you in the same place.
This is particularly obvious at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your rival must stand before you no matter what.
The thing is, when he's on his way to you, he's making your view worse, leading to one or more accidents on this site.
You can understand an attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's starting to cause irritation.
It's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, the game is exciting and sometimes so full of events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
No matter what makes you miss, the concept of five unique tracks, a sequence of races or something.
The idea of changing cars during a race is unusual.
You need to track the gas stations on the way, because it's them that your car can change, even though in most cases the ones you already have are enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports machines are suitable for cities; powerful American cars for direct sections of the highway; and exotic super-sports for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain tracks.
The main mode is closely linked to the challenge mode; it is a race on individual sites that you will recognize as you proceed.
This is where you win for your personal business both the medals and the glasses common to the challenge regimes and the story.
Many opportunities are available for a higher level of driving, from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with those of other players, and provides communication with the public.
Here is another shortcoming that is difficult to understand; this is an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car are going into a subway tunnel, where you're going through the tracks in the dark.
Your speedometer shows a figure of between 150 and 200 km / h (let's think so) when a subway train is suddenly on the back of you, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For a few days, our drafting has been discussing whether, at the time of the game's creation, no one really thought for a second, or whether its creators really think we're such a fool.
The technical component of the game is not special; but the overall impression of the video is, for the most part, pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
While it is regrettable that, in some critical points, the quality of the record is sometimes very high.
This is particularly the case with a large number of participants, where a good record would not be of much help to you either.
The sound is fine; the soundtrack is for an amateur.
In order to please the widest possible youth audience, the soundtrack 'has been made up of different styles'; but it is unlikely that many people will buy a game because of its music.
The general impression of Need for Speed: The escape is rather disorderly.
If the game were to avoid clearly unnecessary mistakes, we could say in earnest that the escape is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves a sense of non-completion.
Of course, it's a good entertainment, but get ready to be blinded as a searchlight of the airport.
The University's Horns of Carlov will be performing at the "Students in Barkhat" concert.

Ambassador to the EU, Vickorova:
The Checks have a reputation for bad-faith and skeptics in relation to the euro.
"The Treaty of Lisbon has created significant differences between individual organizations."
"I didn't expect such a cruel war to happen."
"It will take five or six years before the situation is any more stable, calm down and all the players get used to their new roles," EU Ambassador Milena Vickilova has been very hard to start his lecture at the Law School.
She has shown the extent to which her "Clear and Open about Europe" motto is being followed in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and the relationship between them so easily and clearly that many lecturers from the Law School of the KU would be jealous.
Moreover, Vickarova was commended for the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"At first, critics said that he was a regular gray office mouse that could not play any role; I must say, everyone was amazed at how well he managed his role."
"He is a man who can listen at the same time to, communicate with and have a clear idea of where the EU needs to be developed."
She explained her new position as a representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? What number do I need to call?" that is, an important step towards the harmonization and greater transparency of the Union's policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one's going to ban our cheese.
The programme, which is key to the EU in the past, the present and the near future, has been further focused on the Vicková.
It called the Czech presidency a successful one last year.
The Chekhs were dealing with the impending financial crisis; they had overcome the crisis and organized a summit of the East Partnership.
She said that the resignation of the Government at that time was a negative phenomenon that had caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
Czech representatives are currently very busy in the EU.
As the Ambassador has said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have led to the ongoing displacement.
In addition, a new seven-year EU budget is needed, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be meagre and cost-effective, which areas would be preferred; which countries would receive more support and which were less; all those issues would be in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: "About Europe, A Clear Language."
"I really don't like cuts, foreign words, and a jargon that no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curves or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our varieties of cheese. '
It also intends to make better use of the EU environment and to attract more cheques to European organizations.
A multi-speed Europe is our future
The Ambassador claims that the Checkhs are considered to be Euro skeptics; as well as people who note the negative rather than the positive aspects of things.
She wanted more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
It believes that there are several factors: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time, with little support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she noted the strength and cooperation of the Wishegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and the dictionary joins us, the French next to me says," Hey, what is this meeting about again, the Vishegrad group? "and he's not happy about it."
In the future, the Union of Vicková is largely looking forward to new strict rules for the budgetary policy of the States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considered the idea of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the eurozone."
"We have a Schengen area, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that countries that want to be united, while those who do not want may be left out."
"The number of such institutions will increase; it will be a real two-speed Europe," waiting for Vickolov.
In that regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in promoting the rule that all issues relating to the entire EU should be discussed by all member countries, not just those in the European Area.
The story of the brand:
The IBM innovator is entering the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find a word that best sets out the IMB strategy, the closest one is probably "lasting."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was laid by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson, the oldest.
He believed in his motto that many of the world's problems could be easily solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Think!" has thus become a stamp around which the life of a future giant (as well as the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means a constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and thrived for a hundred years because he remained faithful to his original values, although he was not afraid to change everything around himself.
In our first 100 years, it has allowed us to transform technology, business, and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more, "said the current leader of Samuel J. Palmisano on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of care for employees, just as Bata in the Czech Republic - the IMB staff were among the first United States employees with paid leave, insurance from the employer, an elegant uniform and a complex system of bonuses for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The same advanced is the long-term relationship between IBM and consumers.
From the beginning, the company found a brilliant use for talented people, one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
Accepts the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, under which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmisano next year.
She worked for IBM for 30 years; she is currently the Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
Over the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brain attacks, during which many future innovations are emerging.
No wonder there's a lot of ideas - about half a million people working in the company.
Organization with good reputation
The company & apos; s strong position in business is provided by strong internal and external image.
"From the very beginning, from the point of view of IBM, he was more of an organization than a technology company," said the economist Professor of Harvard Business School and author of the IBM book Rosabet Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it is a company that helps solve business problems using technology," adds Joj Koloni from Forrester Research's consulting company.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as they call it in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies.
It seems to be the most universal technology company - hardware and software development; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services - from servers to nanotechnology.
She owns the largest number of patents among all United States technology companies, and five of her employees received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swaps, a bar code and a diskette.
With $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM became the second largest technology company this year (Apple's first place), overlooking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking forward
Not all of its products have been tasteful to the customers and are in the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS / 2 operating system; the Prodigy online service and IBM Pisjr computers.
"If your business is determined by the way forward, you can't be emotionally tied to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM is very easy to lay the foundations on several platforms - if they don't work, it's not working.
This is different, for example, from her competition, Microsoft, who is based on and is experiencing a decline on Windows, its operating system.
Advanced technology
The main income of IBM is from services, and about one fifth in each case comes from computer software and hardware.
While in 1990, with capital half as much, it was the strongest company to produce equipment.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion in low-income assets, and at the same time it has invested 58 billion in the purchase of advanced technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the world was first hit by the current economic crisis.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the number of investments during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to have done no harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM shares has increased by a record 120 per cent; the net earnings of the company have increased steadily.
The corporate motto of IBM is to change everything but its own values.
It can therefore be expected that even if another crisis occurs, this flexible giant will be able to deal with the situation.
IBM history: from a cheese knife to a space flight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago, and its original name "Computation Corporation, Tabulation, Records" was quite complex.
It was named IBM in 1924, originally called the brand used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future IBM were the merger of four companies, the history of which began in the 1880s.
They were in possession of technologies such as legendary "service hours," that is, hours that record the time when staff come and leave work.
The new company's architect was a businessman, Charles Ranlet Flint, who, until 1930, also headed the company's board of trustees.
Flint hired the director of the competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then put the founder of IBM in the shadow - Watson's ideas remain the basis of a strong corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as is clear from the name, began with the production and sale of various business equipment, from raw knives and meat cuts to cash machines.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, the revenue doubled to $9 million, and a large-scale expansion of the company to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that, almost 40 years later, his son, Thomas Watson Jr, took his place in the principal's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA control space flights to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 to fly a man to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, IBM line System / 360.
The classic PC, which established computer standards at the time, called IBM 5150, was introduced into the market in 1981.
After 20 years, IBM sold computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, while at the same time buying the PricewaterhouseCoopers' consulting office, thus focusing entirely on consulting and high-value-added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great progress with its concept of "Smarter Planet."
Its objective is to make reasonable use of technologies in areas where this has not yet been planned and to improve the road situation and urban governance.
In the area of commerce, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
The IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be located simultaneously in central and eastern Europe, IBM established its office in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also runs a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters of central and eastern Europe is located in Prague, where a world-level research group is also working to recognize speech.
Richtarjova about his wrong husband:
Yveta, keep the fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarjova (53) said it was over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtarge (53), became a bodyguard and lover of Yveta Bartoshova (45), Darina was still hoping that he would wake up and return home.
However, she no longer wants to wait, and she has made clear the rules for her future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," explained Richtarzov.
When Darina Richtarjova was provided with Bartoshova's house in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And even though she made Yvette leave Rzičan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
In fact, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After a while, Darina gave up, pretending to accept his husband's novel; and now he has finally said good-bye to him.
Richtaru doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with.
Even if Richtarge and Bartoshova ever break up, his wife will not accept him with open arms.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will expel him."
"But he will end his days not as my favorite, lost and found old fool, but as the man with whom I am bound," said Richtarzhov, adding that she had already freed herself from her husband and insisted only on a double-handedness.
So far, Joseph has nothing against his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yveta, I'm not going to change that."
"My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our union is still functioning; I am responsible for the repair, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly normal, but we don't share the bed anymore," said Richtarge to Blesk.
He claims that if Richtarjova finds a new love, he won't be in her way.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she has a friend with.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yvette and I have full responsibility, "Joseph concluded.
The worst women's habits: do they touch you?
When you ask men to name some typical bad women's habits, they usually list them all immediately.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the next lines, describing a few women's habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Is your second half complaining that you go shopping all the time?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping on big sales?
If so, your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need some control over their shopping passion.
And yet, which one of you will refuse to go shopping for clothing in search of a perfectly sitting dress and try it on (preferably in different color options) in the dressing room?
The shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it could be a dry hell.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait outside...
Eternal discontent
"I'm too fat?"
"I have to drop at least five kilos," maybe I should start doing gymnastics. "
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you are part of a group of women who are obsessed with their appearance.
Not that you need to stop following yourself, but many men are literally allergic to a partner's constant complaints about their appearance.
The strong gender also agrees that the more such complaints occur, the more women annoy them.
The most important thing is order and purity.
It's like an endless story.
A glass wash, a vacuum cleaning, a floor wash, a dust, a bathroom cleaning, at least twice a week.
You're criticizing your partner for entering a clean cafeteria in dirty shoes; children for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on a window glass in a living room that was so hard to clean?
If you are suffering from this "deviation," try to understand that it is not good to be in extreme situations; and that in your family order and purity should not be at the top.
The indecent desire for purity can threaten your relationship as well as your family.
The desire to command
"Throw your underwear in the basket."
"You're gonna wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Soft dishes for the dishes shall not be on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner a few times a day, he might think it's very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men knew that, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Gossip
Some women like to gossip, insult and be intrigued against others.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with who, how and why.
Every once in a while, I guess each one of us is going to let the gossip go.
Let's be honest, that's probably the nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious gossip girls, women who often talk and despise others, and they, especially in the women's working group, pose a great danger to their environment.
The results of Yagra and Vorachek's programmes helped Philadelphia win.
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful hockey shows by Yaromir Jagra helped Philadelphia win 5: 3 on the ice of Carolina, again becoming the most effective Czech player in the game.
In both cases, Claude Giru used the experience of a thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another show and was declared the best player in the game.
The two results were also from the same team as Yagram Yakubu Vorachek.
After the match, Yagr told foreign journalists that he had predicted a great evening for Gira.
"I told him before the game that he would hit a het-trik."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel this kind of thing," explained to Jagre, who, after his actions, Gira scored a goal at the first opportunity that Flyers gave.
A little later, the second goal of the team also had a "Czech mark."
The Harrikeins Warachek, who had been locked up, took possession of the Shayba and handed it over to Maxime Talbot, who had been in between circles.
One second before the first break, a domestic player, Patrick Dwyer, was able to close the gap with a number-one advantage, but at the beginning of the second time they again led the Fleyers.
Especially Giru.
After a successful performance, Jagr scored a third goal; his impact was then transformed into the fourth goal of Wayne Simmons.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," said Yagr, praising his centric.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years at the NHL, my teammates have been trying to help me, and now it's my turn," added Jagr.
Caroline made the match more dramatic, with the help of Tuomo Rutu and Dwayer's penalty, reducing the gap to one goal.
The further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger was doing great in our area."
"He hit the neck, I accelerated, and Reid went to the far end."
"I was aiming at him, and I'm glad it worked," described to Voracek my impression from the last goal of the game.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
He left the game in the second period because of an injury to the top of his body.
Together with an experienced advocate, Kanadyens lost his two-track advantage and lost 2: 3 after a series of penalti.
Tomas Plekans couldn't get hit in one of their attacks.
More than lost points, the home coach was upset by the high number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We only finished the game with one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"Anyway, there's nothing we can do about it, just have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement for replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the Shayba out of our area."
"What was our weak side," added a lawyer for P.K. Subban.
After 30 attacks, the Czech holoquipper Onjay Pavelica helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5: 2.
The Goes of Jates, who interrupted the five-game series, were captured by five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five State-owned tourism agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
As travel to the West was severely limited, travel agencies at the time were mostly selling tours to the socialist bloc countries.
Thus, Czech tourists were on vacation to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which caused significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (that is, Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual visits to socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel on its own, for example to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation from that country was required; another individual journey was not possible.
At that time, travel agencies offered to the West, but they either had to stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or have "good friends" at the agency.
And that wasn't all.
The foreign exchange permit was necessary for travel to the West and was not issued to politically insecure people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without a currency permit, it was not possible to obtain money (Western currency) for travel to the West.
Most often, the Checks have spent their leave at home, which has resulted in a large number of cottages and summer houses, a habit that has continued to this day.
Since 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic has thus experienced a real revolution.
While, until 1989, leave in the GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our travel, last year the Checkhs held 4.5 million leave in countries around the world.
The great paradox, which we no longer understand, is that until 1989 we were unable to visit the most popular Croatia today, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In early 1990, the need to obtain a visa to neighbouring countries of Western Europe was cancelled, which led to a huge wave of short-term travel, mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakia could not have been full of travel to the West, and everyone wanted to go there for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents because their income at that time was insufficient for a hotel or a boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring their own food (canned, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech kroner, and after decades our tourists are finally free to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income have grown, which has led to another important situation around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has allowed travel agencies to prepare regular flights by charter airlines, and since the past, flights have now become extremely cheap because of the ability to order wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the cheques did not need a visa to visit almost all the developed world countries except the US, which made our travel even easier.
The next significant development in the history of the post-revolution travel took place in 2000, with a large demand leading to the historic first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have taken Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flights from the Czech Republic will be on 12 exotic tracks.
At present, about 100,000 Chekhs visit exotic countries every year!
Another important development of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States cancelled the need to obtain a visa for Czech tourists, so that our country has become a permanent member of the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in history in 2008, more than half of their leave was held abroad (50.3 per cent); for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person during the period of leave abroad, including their expenses at their destination.
The General Assembly must choose the President, and the threat of a pat is coming back.
For about five months, Czech football had no president, and there is a risk that the successor Ivan Gashek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on how to proceed with the electoral rules.
Without that, one of the three candidates will not be voted on.
Yindrzyy Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Pazlik are eager to lead Czech football.
When he left his post in June, he called on his colleagues to come together and find a strong person who would lead football in the future.
However, the Gachek era has once again plunged football into a conflict between two houses of association that cannot choose a single candidate.
This became very clear on 16 September, when a new President was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly have come to the National House in Prague, Smikhov, for nothing but the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote at a general meeting, only the legal representatives or officials to whom credentials had been granted.
This point has since been partially resolved by the recommendation of the Institute of the State and by the rights that representation based on the powers granted is not possible.
However, disputes about the rules of the elections continue.
The Executive Board has also not been very helpful, although it has focused on this issue at its meetings, both ordinary and extraordinary.
The idea of how to vote had changed several times, but the key issue remained the same.
The question is: how to move to the third round and avoid a pat?
"The dispute is whether to follow established standards or to find another model," is said by one of the Vice-Presidents of FAČR Dushan Freedom, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
On the basis of the model set out in the statute, the third round is won by a candidate who has received a great deal of support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to agree to a compromise - to consider the candidate with the largest number of votes in both chambers to be the winner.
The Czech side insists on the condition that, in the total percentage, the winner must obtain at least two thirds of the vote.
"Nevertheless, the two previous rounds would then have lost their meaning; that would have completely rejected the concept of the two chambers," freedom agreed with Moravia's arguments, and he said that it would be better not to change the rules and to vote in accordance with existing rules.
A few sudden, Tomas Pazlik agreed with his view, although according to the electoral rules defined by the statute, Pelt was given more than other candidates.
"I would like to see the elections as far as I can."
"I want to avoid all kinds of representational stupidity, as at the previous general meeting," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is the first candidate; and in his remarks he largely contradicted Pelte.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He believed that the new President would be known in Nimburg; he also hoped that the candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"All emotional displacement will calm down after the national team is expected to go to the European Championships."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, people will be more willing to cooperate," said the representative of Yablonetz, who, of the three candidates, has the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Reichl's more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
"This is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"This could cause another collapse of the general meeting."
"I hope common sense wins," said Reichl.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some information, some negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight, which was to be delivered, among others, by Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kuchru and Reichla to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning because of a technical failure, and sought an alternative to bring part of the executive committee to the place where the game was held.
After all, the ministerial meeting expected on Wednesday could be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Joseph Dobeš, would like to see an agreement reached between the opposing parties, as part of the strongest sports association in the country.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; the creditworthiness of football; and the planned general meeting of ČSTV with a new direction for Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
The Pazlik is in a presidential struggle because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If, before the extraordinary general assembly, the head of the football team, Plzen Tomas Pazlik, saw a strong candidate who met all his requirements for the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not even apply for a high post.
"If there was a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not be involved."
"But a man like this has not yet been found," said Pazlik ČTK.
Pazlik's motive to fight against Miroslav Pelta and Yindrzyh Reichl is to try to prevent Pelte, the alleged majority of the elections, from entering the FČR administration.
Moreover, Pazlik stresses that if he wins, he will remain President only until 2013, when another general assembly is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be held by an experienced top manager not too connected to football life.
"I've talked to a few people I could have mentioned."
"It was terrible for me to hear some of them say they don't even want to have anything to do with Czech football at the moment."
"I'd like to change that opinion," he said.
At present, the main difference between Pazlik and Pelta is the relationship between the latter and Roman Berbra, the President of the regional football association in Plzen, and Berbr is a man of conflicting reputation who, behind the scenes, is known as an influential lobbyist that can influence the voices of delegates to the general assembly.
Pazlik therefore considers it unacceptable that Pelta be president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and football will not move forward."
"With the support of Berbra, a possible businessman, it would be even more harmful to football," said Pazlik.
He refers to the fact that a few years ago, Pelta's name was recorded during a phone audition during a corruption investigation; Pelte was able to avoid a sentence.
"I don't know what the prestige of Pelta's victory would be."
"And as we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Pazlik, he now does not mention his earlier statement that he would "sell the Plasen club if Pelta became President."
If Pazlik won on Thursday, he could present his cooperation with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, who was supported by Pazlik before the general meeting in September, which ended in fiasco.
"He would be the first person I would have turned to."
'He's very capable. '
"I can imagine him at the head of the team."
"But he can't run an association."
"I don't know what I don't know either," said Pazlik, who received a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of a judicial team led by Ludek Mazela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Pazlik claims he would risk running an association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer, he has run the Plzen team, which, with his help, celebrated his first triumph in the League in May.
"I have the power to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better."
"To limit the influence of certain groups of persons who are inclined to influence the disciplinary and appeals board, which leads to heinous situations," said Pazlik, who is not hiding his antipathy, for example, to the Director of Sparta, Daniel Krzhetinsky.
One of its priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, through which it will lobby at the highest political level for more money for lottery-based sports.
"This is one of the key points to be addressed by the new president."
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they have to make clear where the money goes," he said.
Pazlik does not consider his connection to the Plzen club a burden, although he claims that the president of FAČR should be independent.
Pelta is connected to the Yablonetz, and Reichl is connected to the Prague Dukloy.
"It's not the perfect option."
"And yet I don't see the point in the hypocritical transfer of my shares of the Plzen Club to anyone else, since I'm going back in six months," says Pazlik.
Pelta promised new FAČR rules that would avoid the selected Pat.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for new FAČR rules in order to avoid future disputes over election rules.
Before the talks on Thursday in Nimburg, the Yablonetz functioner remains optimistic and believes that attention from the electoral struggle will significantly divert today's expected success from our football team.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment before the last general meeting, so the two-month delay could be useful to him to keep his ideas on football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"They feel that now is the time for someone to lead an association," a man, mostly associated with the Yablonese club, claims; but he spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to believe that he's experienced enough to run Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
"Unfortunately, rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at a general meeting in June."
"If the different ways of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president since September," said Pelt.
He referred to the rewriting of the key document of the civil association as a false purpose for delegates.
"If I become President, I will consider it my personal task, and I will assume my personal responsibility if this attempt is failed."
"This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist," Pelt says.
In addition, he says he's not trying to separate himself from his competitors.
In the past, he had stated that he could present his cooperation with Yindrzyh Reichl, whom he valued for legal education; he was well aware that his rival candidate should be his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Pazlik, who was constantly criticizing Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year, and he's made some progress."
"In any case, his attacks were indecent, and many people were surprised by his campaign."
"And so some of them now doubt his true identity," said Pelt about his competition, and Pelta himself claims that he is faithful to the declarations that he made in September.
He considers his main weapon to be the knowledge of football, from the lowest level of competition to the national team.
The national team should represent the whole football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents from the Bohemian case or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would then focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football," a 40-year-old candidate said ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of football would not result in the dismissal of staff.
"I will need to know the job instructions of individual employees." That was his message to the Insurance, where the long period of interpower is causing a clear inconvenience.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned general meeting, he believed that delegates would be coming to Nimburg on Thursday.
"If the only controversial question is how to hold an election in the third round, we can handle it."
"Football needs the trust he can get only by finally electing his leader," says Pelt, who remains optimistic two days before the key day of his career.
Reichl promises that, under his leadership, FAČR will be active.
If, at a meeting on Thursday, Yindrzyy Reichl, the current Vice-President, becomes President of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association are said to be displeased.
Reichl promises that if he is elected, it will be a long time for hard work.
He wants to establish changes in the system and make the members of the executive committee responsible for selected areas in football.
He also promises to address the problem of the Bohemans; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money into football; and to continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Gashek.
"As President, I would like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national team, professional football and football activities for young people."
"I don't want to say that I will do it myself," said Reichl in my interview for ČTK.
"I'm a team player, and I want to share the powers in the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area."
"I will carefully distribute the tasks so that in each of these segments, football will take great steps forward."
"Many people may not like it, because it would mean hard work, not just criticism of others' work," he added.
The critical atmosphere in the football movement allegedly led him to doubt his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it makes any sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put sticks in my wheels and question my every step," he explained his doubts.
"Nevertheless, many people told me that I should not give up, or others would come."
"It's a trust I can't give up," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to cut it all off."
"There have been processes that can produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation in the Association could return to what was before Gashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and this is something that Mirek Pelt is hardly competent to do."
"He is surrounded by people who would be doing football so that it is available only to the chosen."
"I can be accused of a lot of things, but not of being subjective."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everything will have a good time, not just the chosen minority," said Reichl.
Moreover, he refutes the allegations that he will only be President of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do a maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second league into Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Reichl.
While the head of the Plzen Club, Tomas Pazlik, took part in the presidential struggle, Reichl did not dare to assess his chances of victory.
"Nevertheless, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its Vice-President, and I see that I have made some obvious progress," said Reichl, who has made the savings of tens of millions of kroner on unprofitable contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on a lottery law.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part that there is no unity in the association.
While he claims that Pelta was "excluded from the process of returning credit to Czech football," he considers another rival, Pazlika, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job at Plesen this year."
"If he is chosen, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gaschek started without significant changes in the staff of the committees."
"He would not distort the facts for his benefit," said Reichl about his opponent.
Europe's most beautiful basins
Jump in the water.
Julia Stanek
Children & apos; s basins with universal fibre optics and status basins in Budapest, where travellers can test Europe & apos; s incredible water - and relax the tired body in the Jacuzzi after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder could not have been on his research trip for the last year and a half: without his bathing suit.
Lying on her back in the water, she looked up to the taste of the shaped dome, swimming towards the marble cheruvims waiting for her at the end of the pool, and she was looking at the carefully rebuilt Al-Nuvo swimming basins.
She was in a hurry to add every pool she liked to her notebook - with important details about building and the history of the building.
The history of the Meder architecture has examined more than 200 swimming basins - and has now gathered impressions in his recently published book Badefreuden (The Rainbow of the Bathing), where everything has come from the public basins in Munich to the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest and "functional concrete buildings" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited the bathing houses in the Czech Republic, France, Italy, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city each in Croatia, Luxembourg and Serbia.
The 46-year-old author is a real bathing-culture enthusiast.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but everything is different in the water.
The only disadvantage is that seafarers must accept the blue cafeteria and the smell of chlorine, while the runners can breathe the tempting smell of the softwood forests or listen to the joy of the birds in the park.
"I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so terrible," said the Vienna Meder.
"So I started to collect beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
The swimming in the pool and the refined oil in the sauna is a healing factor in the bathing galleys that is so significant, because, according to Meder, all feelings are being encouraged.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes if the builders take on such work. "Instead of the floor in the pool, you have a surface of water."
"The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All are visible: high ceilings, colour plates, and tram plates.
The Illustrated 190-page edition of "The Rainbow of Bathing" contains valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of health oases, and you have a desire to jump into the water.
The Meder Water Collector found several outstanding copies during a study in Hungary.
It found a nitrate-rich water in a cardboard cave (a bathing suit in Miskolc-Tapolz) and a thermal bath filled with alkali water in a building built in the form of a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Yasberen), as well as excellent therapeutic bathing, such as 100-year-old Cecheni in Budapest.
Of many heated open basins in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, an amazing view is opened. You can see the whole of Zurich from the coat on the roof, or you can look at the snow Arlberg from the open basin in St. Anton, and there's a window in the steam window that allows you to see what's going on on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design is waiting for a swimmer in Langenfeld, an aqua cathedral in Etztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
In the winter, it brings up pairs of three open shells, which seem to be very small in the background of the Ezzthal Mountains.
Algambra in Schwarzwalda
The meder pool collector didn't meet the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many of the thermal bathing suits smell like gray, the Arpad in Beckashchab, they smell so much oil that you might find it hard to believe you're in a healing source.
The smell is caused by the hydrocarbonates in the alkali water, and the water is almost black from the oil that's clinging to the skin as soon as you get into the pool, a kind of healing experience.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at a certain point in her search for beautiful bathing places, and when she tried to visit an open pool of Czech bathing in Lugachovicz, she found the area sealed.
The purchase was closed in 1902, and was designed by the architect, Dušan Yurković.
When Meder looked at the windows of the red-white-yellow building, in an arnuvo style, she saw the weeds growing between the cafeteria plates.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on the hot tracks is the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwalda, the Palace of Thermal Water in Bad Wildbad.
The basins have already been completed in three stages of construction. You will find not only the neo-Roman elements of the post-construction period in 1844, but also the Mauritanian Algambra Hall, which was added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite fuse basin of the Iris Meder basins, not just because it is from Schwarzwald.
"It's a real achievement, so good to combine such different architectural walls," says Meder.
It's a very secondary occupation to be in a thermal pool in a palace like this.
Speculation of agricultural products
Deutsche Bank is investigating trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tives.
Will the Bank stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkermann gave the working group the task of investigating the impact of speculation on the poor worldwide.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
The situation is clear for German citizens, and according to one study, 84 per cent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two thirds of the respondents require that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
The findings were drawn from a study carried out by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa on behalf of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The report, Harald Schuman, shows that playing on world commodity exchanges raises prices - and banks are thus involved in world hunger.
The campaign of consumer advocates is directed directly against the head of the Deutsche Bank, Joseph Akkermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also trading in the same way.
The prices on goods were originally intended as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that players have given up supply and demand rules - and are at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann responded to the criticism that he had promised to investigate the charges and stated that no trade "is worth risking the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of the Deutsche Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may or may not be able to take place.
Ackermann is working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. "The stakes on rising food prices are a glaring example of how reckless banks are now acting against common interests."
As the bank's main lobbyist, Akkermann has a certain obligation, according to Bode.
"The Bank's Deutsche must remove from the portfolio all investments that make money on food prices," said Boda.
"It doesn't matter if it's about hungry people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's rapid response is surprising at first, but the director would like to have an impeccable image just a few months before the end of his office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman would not move to the monitoring board as planned.
The elimination of controversial speculation on the food market could improve its image.
He also had little to take care of the costs; his successor would have to deal with the consequences.
One in two would have given up investment in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization & apos; s campaign.
Bode published a study on Tuesday, which was conducted for the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis, Forsa, on 7 and 8 November, and 1,001 participants.
Not more than 11 per cent believe that the investments that bid on food prices are acceptable to the Bank's Deutsche.
Many bank clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such a trade; according to the study, each other would withdraw the contributions that ultimately led to speculation.
43 per cent would have recommended leaving the bank, 49 per cent said that they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
The pavilion is in a new place.
Ingeborg Vinsovski
The architectural history of taking off, falling and happy ending - the Austrian Pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and abandoned.
Now it's being opened again as an exhibition centre.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Carl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of a modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass hills, which have expressed confidence in technological progress.
The Schwanzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix for architecture in 1958 for his light, floating steel and glass structure.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
After all, he was famous for the world in 1973 for his legendary four-cylinder tower BMW and her sister, a bowl-shaped building.
The pavilion, designed as a building for temporary exhibitions, was moved to the Swiss garden near the southern Vienna station, transformed and opened as the 20th century Museum in 1962 - often referred to as the "20th century House" for that reason.
However, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - there were no walls on which to hang works of art and poor air-conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until the modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and its condition has become worse and worse.
The architect Adolf Krishanitz has now re-established a pavilion called the House of the 21st Century and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is the section of the Belvedere Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday night - a happy event in all respects.
Agnes Hussain-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new endeavour.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate from the Arts History Department with a brilliant career, is a young woman who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and eventually became the founder and director of the Salzburg Museum of Soviem, convinced politicians and custodians to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum was to accommodate a permanent exhibition of the Fritz Vubba Foundation, a café and a bookstore, along with modern art, and an office building was to be built.
Strict monitoring of & limited budget
Krishanitz was the perfect candidate for the project at the time.
He was known, of course, because of the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Sec, Joseph Olbrih, and won the competition, but he also went to Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was a "very important place" for him to attend the "almost every week" exhibit.
He knew the original design and the tasks that were facing the building, a building that had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems of the last restructuring were much more serious, the building was a "energy sink," said Krishanitz.
The end profiles on the glass facade were replaced, the glass-fibre-reinforced safety glass was introduced and the glass roof was replaced by a high-strength safety glass.
The steel bulkheads of the heat bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceiling.
The two lower floors have created space for new use of the building, and a leaking light well between the building and the street provides lighting - a practically new building, but still an elegant Pavilion of Schwanzer.
The original external doors were retained and the building was painted in an old red-brown colour to protect against corrosion.
The movie hall is the same as it used to be.
All of this is under strict control of the museum administration and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap and approved by the museum department," said Krishanitz, pointing to a sour in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite the constraints, challenges and transformation.
Krishanitz recently noted that the "from Brussels" pavilion was a rough, typical story of "drop in the city."
Such an architecture is "always out of place" and nevertheless wants "to stimulate real awareness."
The house of the 21st century is in the very right place, as the planning of the city has had an unexpected success. A fully redesigned "main station quarter" with offices and housing is growing around the Swiss garden.
The house of the 21st century can be supplemented by the second building of Krishanitz, a collector of Francesca von Gabsburg, who has acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly negotiating with the city to place him next door in the Swiss garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multi-million-million-dollar winter crisis package.
Deutsche Bahn announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid a train being marked in winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter marks and late trains.
With reference to the Deutsche Bahn internal crisis plan, Beld reports that up to 2015, a total of about 300 million euros are planned for investment.
Investments are designed to improve the efficiency of locomotives and the railway network, even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of staff of their own who are involved in cleaning snow from the routes and platforms will be doubled, to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the platforms from snow and ice before work begins and 90 per cent of the required arrows within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of marking and building trains in this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
The last winter, Deutsche Bahn, had considerable difficulties in passenger transport, as it lacked reserves at a time of deterioration of weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Federal Railway Service for years.
There were also some delays in the delivery of the ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the axles of the ICE trains much more often for many years after one of the ICE trains had a broken axle at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay a lot of millions of pounds of fine in the United States.
New problems came after the unrest around Joseph Akkermann, Director General of the Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank is facing a fine of many million pounds in the United States.
As if Deutsche Bank had little problems in his country, the past of an industrial giant in the United States now had him, and the Bank with its headquarters in Frankfurt would pay 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle the disputes that had arisen since the bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five major credit unions.
The problem was the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Office of Credit Unions (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accused a number of major banks of using false promises to deceive credit unions to buy their financial products.
The value of the bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and brought credit unions down.
"We are pleased that we have resolved this problem without the parties going to court," said the representative of Deutsche Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not plead guilty.
The same is true for the Stigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
The president of NCUA, Debbie Matz, welcomed the operational response of both banks.
The National Office of Credit Unions (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer contributions.
The NCUA is fighting to compensate for the losses that come out of billions.
This is the first agreement of this kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and initiated proceedings in the summer against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Fate mortgage bonds are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
They are supported by domestic loans.
This decided the fate of a number of financial companies when the real estate market bubble in the United States broke in 2007.
The American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 at the core of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have filed a large number of claims, requiring compensation or punishment for frauds.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is behind the largest wave of claims.
It accuses the 18 largest international banks of having bought some $200 billion in collateral from Fanny Mae and Freddy Mac's credit organizations.
The Bank also faces the risk of being prosecuted by FHFA for numerous agreements with a total value of $14.2 billion concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires a bank with headquarters in Frankfurt to assume responsibility for "significant losses," but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and indicated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffet is investing 10 billion in IBM.
The financial guru of Buffet is actively investing in the IBM IT company.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion in shares.
So far, the largest American investor, Warren Buffet, has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies, as their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM & apos; s annual report changed his view of investing in the industry.
According to Buffet, he should have known much earlier that IBM was the first to offer services and buy computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffet's investment was seen as a knight's act.
IBM, an IT-industry veteran, now has the title "Sir IBM."
In an interview with the United States business channel CNBC, Buffet reported that he had purchased IBM shares for a total of $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding of Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5%.
Buffet said that even IBM had not known anything about his involvement until recently.
He commended the management that was able to make a profit even during the financial crisis.
"They did a lot of work," Buffet said, with a management strategy in mind.
The IBM has been focused on high-income IT services such as the date-centres.
The foundation of the computer industry, which is now over 100 years old, also offers software and advisory services, as well as strong computers for business.
So far, Buffet has been avoiding technology companies.
He claimed he only invested in those companies whose business he understood.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of lubricants and in engineering.
His holding of Berkshire Hathaway owns a long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Münchener Rück), along with about 80 of his own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old bought a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and built one of the world's most expensive companies through able investment.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
By making it a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable instinct in making money brought him the name "Oracula of Omaha."
The IBM stock price increased by one per cent before the opening of markets after Buffet's investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, called IBM, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange, making it one of the world's most expensive high-technology companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffet, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder, Bill Gates, is his close friend.
imminent danger
After the identification of the "Zwikkau cell", the Turkish media began to question the authority of the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers is talking about a "bloody ideology," which is now on its way back to the surface.
The killing of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 was the result of a right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were a response to this communication in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has led to long-forgotten fears: there have been no such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks since the arson in Melln in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There had never been a doubt, but xenophobia existed in Germany.
However, the current right-wing extremist network has a scale that is not yet fully understood.
"The rebirth of a bloody ideology?" was the title of the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant of secret services and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded calmly by referring to the victims of racial hatred as a silent picket opposite the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish Community of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral labour force agreement at a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
The coverage in some Turkish media was like a slap. The "50th anniversary gift from Germany" is an article on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X," commenting on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German edition Hürriyet also did not miss the occasion to hold this parallel.
"It's starting to smell bad" is the name of the Ahmet Kulahji column.
He noted that people had been killed who had paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany.
Police conduct and subsequent successful raids were strongly criticized in German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors asked why the German authorities had not previously considered following suspicious persons in right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have reached a rather sharp rhetoric. "If they continue to act as clumsy, migrants will have no choice other than armed self-defence."
"It will be the best self-defense."
"The world in Germany is very much dependent on how the entire network is opened and on the legality of punishment," he writes "Selen."
The crimes in Melln and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example that the world in Germany is at risk.
A picture of the burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply captured in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
No other event has shown so clearly to the Turks here that they are at risk and to the Germans that mistrust and indifference can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity of the Turks.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at that time condemned mainly the failure of the German police following the attacks, and Helmut Kol refused to visit the survivors in Mellna.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey following the arson in Zolingen, but his Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel, took part in a memorial ceremony in Cologne, in his speech, calculated the taxes that the Turks were paying in Germany,
As if he had determined the value of a man by the taxes he paid.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has again shown how many German Turks & apos; lack of confidence in the current German State has increased since then.
By clearly showing what needs to be done now, in addition to efforts to identify and reassess right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal on the Zürich Lake
Most of Europe's leading risk-based banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS was almost bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been fighting one or the other ever since.
Now he must be returned to the right course by the German.
Alex Webber probably didn't know he was gonna get that part.
In July, after his effective resignation from the position of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that he would be in a equally effective position in 2013, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank, UBS, and an unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Webber was clearly excited, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its new strength, and made a few friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has been able to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Fillinger and Oswald Grubel."
But it became clear in September that things would be different.
The UBS Trader in London overwent the bank's security system and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Executive Director Oswald Grübel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the president of the UBS Board of Directors has been considered sick, and everyone wants to know, when will Alex Webber finally take office?
Webber is to be consulted by the bank from February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, it will be presiding over the Council in May, not in 2013.
It's not gonna be easy for Alex Webber.
He's a professor of economics and a Central Bank specialist, not a traditional banker, and he's definitely gonna need time to adapt.
He suddenly turned out to be responsible for the bank's strategy, which once again proved that he had long earned the title of "the largest bank scandal in Europe."
UBS, on the one hand, is very large - until recently, he managed the largest assets in the world - and on the other, has not been out of a scandal for years.
It seems that a proud Swiss bank is not spared by anything.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The Bank has combined the image of a hidden and sustainable but at the same time a skilful asset manager with ambitious objectives and a desire to become the largest player in an investment banking.
As a result, the UBS managed 1.6 billion in 2007, thus having more money in the management of wealthy clients than any other bank in the world,
and as an investment bank, they entered the world's largest banks.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and a professor of banking, who has long taught at the Institute of Banking of the University of Zurich, explains, "I have always brought my students UBS as a model of a good bank."
"Knowing what we know now, you can ask how I could be so wrong."
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that there was something wrong with UBS.
In mid-year, Executive Director Peter Wooffley, who was considered an outstanding intellect and, to the same extent, a brilliant banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to assume why he left.
The investment unit of the bank tried to play substandard securities and was forced to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS reported a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
The Bank has indeed been able to find investors - but those that many bankers would have recently pardoned - one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund that is so hidden that even its name has not been reported.
It was just the first hit.
In April 2008, things became much worse.
The Bank had to announce new billions of losses, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, the second-most-paid President of the Board of Directors in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, there was a disaster, with a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was at risk of collapse and the State had to save it.
The National Bank bought toxic securities from UBS for unnamed billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a binding bond to co-own the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of the huge banks being established in a small country.
After all, the final balance of UBS in 2007 was five times that of all Swiss production (see schedule).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," said bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster came soon after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitalized on a tax dispute with the United States and stated that it was ready to hand over the data of wealthy clients who might have been able to pay off taxes with the help of the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay US $780 million, consisting of recovery of unjustifiably earned business income plus fines.
UBS thus recognized more or less that it was an instrument of tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS has lost what was always his advantage in the struggle for rich clients - a veil of secrecy.
After that, Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The client's money has begun to flow.
In a few months, the bank lost confidence in both of its main areas of activity - investment due to failed speculation and asset management through aid and tax evasion.
And it just calmed down, and it seemed that UBS had been able to reverse the situation, as it had been with the con-trader, and one single trader had dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank had noticed that something was wrong.
One thing is clear: risk management in the investment division is not yet operational.
"The Adobolo incident made it clear that risk control had not changed enough," said Martin Yansen, Professor of Economics and Finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also has no doubt: "UBS's problem is that he has no risk control tool."
It was caution that made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world & apos; s largest assets for a long time - not an excessive risk, but security for money, whether or not the world had collapsed outside the Alpine Republic.
The Swiss bank's safe has become a symbol of permanent reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize a sophisticated taste in chocolate.
UBS's headquarters in Zurich still fits the image of a worthy Swiss private bank, but it's a little more.
Her location is a classic.
The bank & apos; s head office is located in Zurich on Banhofstrasse, which leads from the main station to the Zürich Lake, surrounded by the snow beams of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxury, and the rental rates for the shops are among the highest in Europe.
One of the traditional Swiss stores like Confiserie Sprüngli can be found here by jewellery firms such as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been located here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Kredi Suisse Palace and elite private banks, such as Julius Bare.
The heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
There are large leather sofas along the marble-covered walls, near the bank emblem of the big "safe."
UBS knows what his clients need, reliability.
But both of the major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point, gave up Swiss concepts of banking - or, according to the head of one of the small Swiss banks, betrayed them.
He would not like to see his name in the paper - like all Swiss bankers, he also works with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too big - particularly in an investment banking where the English sax are very active.
In his view, there was nothing to add here.
"And if there is something, they have long adapted to the Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought him the first big profits - and then a fiasco, and no other European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people took the largest rescue operation in the history of the country," Lucas Hassig wrote in his book Kra UBS.
Politicians have approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have come to that?
When asked by Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one major group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which was too large for little Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
It was also helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS were complementary to each other; one was a rich but tiered bank specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly had access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin a powerful wheel.
Two names are related to the growth of UBS: Peter Wolffley, Executive Director of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wolffley and Ospel were a dream team," said the bank analyst, Hans Geiger.
"Wooffley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understanding models and statistics, and Ospel with his internal instinct, all the way up, starting with an intern in a bank."
But Osperl finally relied on Wolffley.
And Wolffley could have made a critical mistake. "He decided that his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride predates defeat.
UBS officials are well aware of the meetings of the board members at which Wolffley has always repeated the same slogan to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he led the "tournament table" where the banks' successes were made.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make part of the way.
UBS was the largest player in the currency trade and government securities.
The authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak location; according to the parameters called "permanent income" in bank terms, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had a failure in American mortgage products.
To shut the hole, UBS was involved in an adventure that almost cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in American substandard securities.
This has developed into a large mechanism that brought together securities based on American mortgages and sold them further - continuing to carry the risks itself.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS bought until the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was already on fire," said bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager had to go after the other as the bank was more difficult to clean up than it seemed at first.
The post in UBS has become a child's game with chairs and remains unreliable until now.
It is almost impossible for anyone who leads this huge bank.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that turns back on all existing business models.
A bank analyst, Geiger, already has an idea of giving up an investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
Nevertheless, it is clear that investment activities need to be significantly reduced.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, is planning to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
A 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually only considered a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor, Grubel.
In the past, he has been able to show the nature and now, as the Zurich Bank stated on Tuesday, he is in charge of UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti is planning to return the investment bank to the state in which he was in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's UBS?
How does he plan on making money?
These questions must be asking themselves Axl Webber.
The only thing he's ever said is that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
The fear of recession in Europe is being brought down by the American stock exchange.
The emerging recession in Europe has worsened the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has given rise to hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the embryos.
The overall relief following the changes of Governments in Rome and Athens was not supported.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half-full, not half-empty - but now the problems are back on track, said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones industrial index closed at 12,078 with a 0.6% drop.
The market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points during the bidding.
The broader S & P 500 index was closed at 1251 points, falling by one per cent.
The Nasdaq technology index lost 0.8%, trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2%, closing at 5,585 points.
Industry in 17 euro-zone countries has significantly reduced production and is adapting to the end of growth.
Statistics Eurostat reported that companies had made two per cent less in September than in the previous month.
This message led American investors into a skepticism. "We're not on the island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman from Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe was not likely to shake the recession quickly and that banks showed further signs of weakness.
The legendary investor Warren Buffet was able only to confirm these concerns, and in an interview with CNBC, he said that it was still unclear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything it took to end the crisis.
He therefore felt that it was too early to invest in European public bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffet threw a long-term principle into the dumpster and invested in the United States high-technology industry.
His investment in IBM, worth more than $10 billion, raised the price of this oldest company's shares by almost one per cent against the trend.
The stock closed, almost unchanged, at $187.35.
Buffet stated that he paid an average of $170 per stock and now has a share of 5.5 per cent.
His investment company, Berkshire Hathway, fell by 1.3%.
Bank of America's shares fell by 2.6%, much stronger than the market.
The Bank has converted almost all of its remaining share of the China Building Bank into cash, paying $6.6 billion.
The Bank is primarily planning to support its capital quota with a net profit from the sale in order to meet more stringent standards.

The shares of 719 companies increased, 2,281 fell and 79 remained at the same level.
The shares of 630 companies have completed their sales of growth, 1913 by a fall and 82 by the same level at Nasdaq, with 1.38 billion shares being sold.
The mold crows fill the cities.
Grachi is considered a problem bird in many places, and experts today say that these very smart birds can no longer be driven out of the city.
Some love birds, others want to get rid of them as soon as possible, and the crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but the people who complain about dirt and noise are growing in many settlements.
The solution to the problem of birds, however, is far from being achieved.
At the first symposium on crows in the city of Ler in East Frizia, the experts claimed that it was no longer possible to expel the poles from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
The search for urban alternatives
Conservatives argued that the root of the urban problem had been the migration of highly protected grains, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture had increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
The hunting, expansion and removal of traditional tree nesting have made life difficult for birds.
The thieves are in custody.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the north-west in Yever, Dipholz, Ahim under Bremen and Ler, there are large colonies with more than 600 parent couples.
The vague project of shooting off crows in Ler caused disapproval of the newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described a bird trap and a stick-up as a particular cruelty.
"The usual movement and disbandment do nothing." said the architect and landscape designer Werner Cleaver from Ler.
The failure of the nest with water or a tree is often undesired, as said by the environmental expert Manfred Kiser of Lara, Baden-Württttemberg.
"The animals dissipate and the large colonies are divided and extended to other areas."
Exemption is possible only by way of an exception in the vicinity of hospitals, old-age homes and schools.
"We're gonna have to live with them." It's not an option to get rid of them. "
In isolation from the surrounding areas, the problem in the cities will not be solved, as said by the mayor, Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
A combination of removing birds from areas in need of protection and encouraging them to return to other areas could be an option.
"The information poles instead of benzopil" was a slogan offered by a psychologist and an ethnoologist, Uta Maria Jurgens, who is in favour of a completely different approach to birds. "We must be confident to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of an educational voron route at Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information on the life of very thought-out poles is provided on the information walls.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Juergens also expressed his opinion on complaints about the noise made by birds. "The noise provides a lot of information. They have a lot to say to each other."
The mind and the mocking of these birds have come into the legends, and the Grachi often use not only the tools to take possession of the pieces that have been taken care of, but also make the weapons themselves.
Behaviour researchers at Cambridge University have recently tested the measure of bird mind in four degrees.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that you had to knock on the bottom to get the larvae.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to hit the bottom.
In another experiment, a more difficult task had to be done by the spectators.
The researchers put a small bucket of moths in the vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get the prey with a key.
But the researchers gave them a piece of wire.
All four birds used wire to make hooks and used hooks to hold a bucket by the pen and get it out of the cylinder.
Three out of four grains have done it since the first attempt.
Ronaldo is taking Portugal to Euro-2012.
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for last-minute victory have not been sustained for a long time.
The Favorits of Portugal, Croatia and Czechoslovakia, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took the last seats at the Euro-2012 Championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the leadership of a superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored at 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal won Bosnia and Herzegovina with a 6: 2 (2: 1) account, making its fifth exit to the Euro perfect after 0: 0 at the first stage.
Cheham was enough 1: 0 (0: 0) in the second round of play-off against the autopsy of Montenegro after a net victory in the first round (2: 0).
Croatia did not lose its chance of playing 0: 0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily reached 1: 1 (1: 0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Poshtiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloza (80th) had the rest of their goals for Portugal.

A former Wolfsburgh player from the Manchester City English championship at 33 minutes sent the ball head to the lower edge of the pants, but the ball did not cross the gate line.
Yirachek is after Chechia.
Then the focus was on Judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
Following the attack on Elder Poshtig at the Bosnian prison site at 36 minutes, Stark decided that the Portuguese player had simulated and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a dubious penalty for playing with his hand after Fabiu Kuentran-Mishimović.
After the break of the 2004 European Vice-Champions, the account was set at four more goals.
Peter Yirachek dispelled all the remaining doubts about the cheques at 81 minutes.
The 1976 European Champions are the fifth consecutive European Championship.
The luck also smiled at the team of Coach Michael Bilek and the legioners of Bundesliga, Michael Kaddlec (Bayer Levercousen) and Thomas Peckhart (1st FK Nürnberg), after an error at the very beginning that could be catastrophic.
A 9-minute 9-minute-long-term reflexer prevented the potential of Tomas Sivok.
Montenegro had the best chance when it had a duet on the field, Stevan Jovetić and Dejan Damjanović.
Damyanovich, at 40 minutes, struck the edge of the prison area and almost scored Chechu's goal.
After the break, he saved a world-class holoquper who had already been caught after the FK Seoul had left the field for the 50th minute.
The victory goal was just before the final whistle.
In the meantime, Turkey did not have enough football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0: 3 in Istanbul, the Turks were unable to play better than the 0: 0 in Zagreb.
Although there is no doubt now that the coach of the Gus Hiddink team will now set aside a place on the bench of the team, which reached third place in 2002, Croats are the fourth time in the final round of the European Championship.
The Turks have almost successfully started in front of 31,000 viewers at the Maximir Stadium.
A further attack by Seljuk Inan at the seventh minute came into the counter, and Kazim Kazim, the attacker, failed to take the ball to the grid.
Croatia then woke up and was increasingly taking control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent shape.
The leaders of Bundesligi, Daniel Pranic (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjukić from the team of Wolfsburgh, who had given up the seat of Ivan Periche from Dortmund for the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni is on his way to Euro-2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first exit to the Euro after Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who already looked confident in his place after winning 4: 0 in the first stage, took a 32-minute lead thanks to Stephen Ward's goal.
Constantine Vasiliev of the guest team compared the account to 57 minutes.
Ireland took a good pace from the beginning, but only on 23 minutes, Robbie Keen from Los Angeles made the first clean, naked blow.
At the last moment, an Estonian defender was able to prevent him from taking Ireland forward.
The goal was hit at 32 minutes.
With the protection of the Goliper Paul Londak, Ward was in the right place and, by putting the ball across the line, he changed the account by 1: 0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China.
The largest software producer in Europe, SAP, is planning to invest billions and almost double the number of its employees in China in the next few years.
The company, which is a member of the Dax list, reported on Thursday that it was about to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) before 2015.
"We will create more opportunities for research and development and hire thousands of people," said Bill McDermott, one of the executive directors of SAP, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
A staff of 2,500 is expected to grow to 4,500.
The world market leader of industrial software plans to double the number of their offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chendu and Dalian.
This country, which is experiencing an economic boom, has about 4,000 SAP clients out of more than 176,000 worldwide.

SAP has been present in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to change the scale of our operations," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth based on information in China."
Mass killings - human dimension
The very, very good new book of Peter Englund, "Beauty and Pain: The Personal History of World War I," begins with a long list of actors from which the heart is dying.
Here's the advice, how to read next: carefully cut this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very closely as Mr. Englund is told, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon at a time when, as one of these men and women, you will get out of the way and lose yourself in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, who is awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite precisely as "work on anti-history."
There are few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, skilful journalists or discussions on tactics and combat equipment.
This is not so much a book about what was, he explains how much "a book about what it was like" is about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and a state of spirit."
The book "Beauty and grief" has brought together the experience of 20 more or less unmarked men and women, on both sides of the front line, from school girls and botanists to albinists, doctors, ambulances and employees.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone will be captured, lose his arm or leg, go crazy or die.
Their lives are shrewd here like church candles: new ones are added to a lot of others, and some of them are fading at this time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
It is also an amendment to the perception that the First World War was only a grave war of the West Front.
"Beauty and sorrow" is a powerful way of giving a panorama to other theatres of war: the Alp, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall into bee ullies; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under pyramid; the unsolved problem is the flies of tsetse.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like a Katrina hurricane that smells like smoke-free powder.
When the canonade is near and you're a woman and you're home with the children, will you stay where you are or will you run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on or why we have to fight this war.
"The lack of facts," Mr. Englund noted, "is filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsession ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and grief" is the fate of people such as Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stoumpf, a young sailor of the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are taken mainly from memoirs, letters and other materials already published.
The stories about their lives may be scary or exciting, but they are very alive because of the little moments and the isolated details gathered by Mr. Englund.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with them.
When he tells the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzac, everywhere is erzac."
"The replacement coffee, the fake aluminium, the non-real rubber, the paper bandages, the wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about erzac food in Germany.
He describes "the meat of the peeled rice, welded in the lamb fat (and decorated by a fake bone made of wood); the tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skin; and the shoes of the tree."
He notes that there were "837 registered substitutes for meat allowed in the production of sausage, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honour and courage.
One American is looking at the most violent and is talking about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men were created for, not to be in a comfortable chair with a cigarette and a whiskey, a evening paper or a best seller, and to say that this show is a civilization, and that a barbarian is not hiding under your sprinkled back shirt."
The British soldier, on the contrary, notes that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or grieve.
"When a man is humbled with the thought of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that this will happen in front of the public," he writes.
But that's the other way around, it's like a "convicted man who's being held in secret."
Other comments concern the old Europe, which is falling apart, and new forms of fear.
"The conflict was increasingly an economic competition," written by Mr. Englund, "a war of factories."
He notes the arrival of someone called "a new species in the bestiaric of the beginning of the century: a beautiful and ideological mass killer in a well-stitched suit that takes a massacre while sitting at a written table."
People act unexpectedly: low-level actions are as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund referred to soldiers who had been trying to pick up a sexually transmitted disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front.
"The most important expression of this is the trade in gonorrhoea, which soldiers have bought and flaunted through their genitals in the hope of entering the hospital," he writes.
"The very desperate put him in the eye, which often led to life's blindness."
Translated with the Swedish Peter Graves Prose by Mr. Englund, a flexible but non-selective, well-suited to his humanist task.
In dozens of small scenes, it shows how war "liberated completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to ask why their leaders force them to fight.
The best books on World War I were often indirect, such as "The Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fassel or such novels as "In the West Front without Change" by Eriha-Maria Remarca, not by exhaustive historical work.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unparalleled pantheon.
His book has the most amazing ending I can remember in non-artistic literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he came from a book to a page with a list of characters, grabbed it out of your hands and set it on fire.
After the previous mistake, a carefully calculated raid.
Hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because Zukotti Park was supposed to be the least of the people at that time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-level officers, and the others were told at first that they were going to the training.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of events, and his presence stressed how much importance the Department of Police attached to operations.
There could not have been a repetition of the episodes of recent weeks, such as the use of transportable gas against protesters, which was contrary to the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy for the occupiers.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation was launched to release the protesters from Zukotti Park.
The authorities were preparing for the occupation in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were held on the island of Randall, with a view to the use of Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - in the light of Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came "last minute," a source familiar with the orders, which referred only to the mission as "training."
"The few cops I know and who were called into this case were not told they were being sent to Zukotti Park," said this man who spoke on an anonymous basis.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were at the highest posts in the department."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson that the city learned.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but they turned their back on hundreds of protesters who had been in front of the scheduled time, hearing about the plans.
The operation was attended on Tuesday by members of various police units, including a force from the districts, a police team that was usually used to control the criminal area around the area.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost as a job, came and left the park during the day, making one hour of the night the right time to come.
"It was right to do that when the park had the least people," he said.
The rescue vehicles, with searchlights and loudspeakers, gathered on Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The searchlights and pre-recorded announcements from the loudspeakers seem to have intimidated many protesters.
When administrative officers in their blue branches entered the park, many protesters just collected their things and left.
The police reported that the tents were not touched until 1: 45 in the morning, giving the protesters time to pack.
Other police groups, according to eyewitnesses, gathered on the perimeter to enter if they needed arrest in the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the head of the Police Department, said that this had been done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they have been prevented from seeing the police work and that they have been mistreated by the police.
Mr. Brown said that cars with cameras on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could make a picture.
When the police went west through a bunch of personal effects of protesters, including bags, plastic carpets and polyethylene bags full of clothes, the Department of Health's teams followed it, collecting what was abandoned.
Some protestors who refused to leave were taken out, and the photos were soon available on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took up positions near the kitchen of the camp, at the centre of the park.
Some have built the barricades, and the police have been inside by way of their arrest.
Some 10 people in the camp's epicentre were holding themselves together.
And two people were chaining themselves to the trees, Mr. Kelly said.
To cut the locks, rescue officers were called.
No arrests were made at the park until about 3: 30 in the morning, Mr. Kelly said.
The clean-up operation was completed about 75 minutes later, reporting to the police.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 people had been arrested in the park.
The majority were arrested for "disturbing public order and resisting detention," he said.
The most senior officer on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department.
Phil, T. Pulaski, the head of the Department's police, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not run the operation," said Mr. Brown.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, in case they had to enter.
The fence was placed on Cortland Street, a quarter north of the park, and on Pine Street, a quarter south.
The observers saw the police extending the perimeter even further beyond Zukotti Park from these positions.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, displacing people even further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of a police car, while others, according to witnesses, released air from a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The school service staff union will sue the city for dismissal
A trade union representing hundreds of school staff who lost their seats last month is planning to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that the dismissal was not necessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students are enrolled.
The trial is probably the last means available to the District Council Trade Union 37, which is trying to cancel the dismissal.
The six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, the parent and other work coordinator, who were among the lowest paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October, as a result of what trade union leaders described as a political response to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds run by groups of workers to close the budget hole last spring.
City officials categorically rejected this accusation.
At a hearing at the City Council last month, Dennis M. Walcott, a school chancellor, said that the dismissal was part of the budget they signed in June.
One member of the Board pardoned, telling him that there was no indication in the budget that school support staff would be dismissed.
The 37 District Council representatives reported that they had filed a claim notification, warning the Department of Education that a claim had been filed against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to declare a formal action before the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The claim will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the City, and will list eight employees who have been temporarily dismissed as plaintiffs, all of whom are black or Latin American women, as will most of the assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a member of the city's legal department, said that the city had not seen a claim and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the preliminary version of the New York Times complaint, the trade union focused on a number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no dismissals on Staten Island and there were few in Upper East Side or Tribeki schools, 17 school assistants lost seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Regions 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants working at the free secondary school of 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of the students live in poverty, the claim states: "These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to fill the budget gap."
P.S. Budget 36 was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and she also lost money when the city changed the way to count additional funding for every poor student who goes to school.
The trade union also claims that school directors may have been misled by the language of the notice allowing the dismissal of parental focal points.
The notice used the word "excess," although "excess" is more often said when a teacher from the school's payroll is moved to the list of available employees paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent focal points have been dismissed," referred to in the case file, "not just transferred."
The mission is over, Congress is ready for an agreement on Libya
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats on the Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, for the long-standing dictator Muammar Qadhafi to be captured and killed, and for the American intervention to end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee should consider a resolution put forward by President John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts), together with Senator John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent, Connecticut), who commended the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the American troops for their "courage."
"The purpose of this resolution is to pay tribute to the courageous people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"This is a confirmation of the support of both parties for their democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but no other discussion on Libya has been easy.
This summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and with the White House on the formulation of a series of resolutions endorsing or condemning the role of the American army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution allowing limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of the two parties and was never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the Chamber also did not support a proposal that would cut the funding of the United States operation in Libya.
This left the American mission in some kind of legislative purgatory - when Congress is disgruntled enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so angry as to actually get the ground out of its way.
Then the events overcame the indetermination of Congress.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to Libyan rebels, and on 20 October, Gaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission formally concluded on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee "admirates the people of Libya for their incredible courage and unusually strong desire for freedom," and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism. "
The resolution also "affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Affairs Council or will the legislature be divided like the June Bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, the leader of the Republicans on the Committee, addressed the last version.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, this week the House of Representatives must vote in favour of a constitutional amendment that requires a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the House of Representatives, Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else to be put to the plenary of the Congress of that Congress.
Other legislators have not yet been able to make their amendments to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
The Goodlat amendment was only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that addressed a wide range of issues that had been introduced in that meeting.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and the Senate - others were minor variations.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the House of Representatives and some more on "control over federal expenditure."
Some of them are also identical but give their authors - mostly newly elected Republicans who wish to decorate their summaries - the opportunity to brag that they "put forward" such a proposal.
The budget control act, which took place in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of the balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen wish to limit the number of terms of office of members of Congress, and a member of the House of Representatives, José Serrano (Democrat, New York), wishes to lift the two-term limit for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) proposed many amendments to guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
The amendment prohibiting same-sex marriages has been proposed for many years, as is another one prohibiting the burning of a flag.
Some legislators also wish to allow the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the states object to them.
As the members of the Congress had sought to propose amendments, they were moving forward no faster than in previous years.
In the 111st Congress, the legislature proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th Congress, 66.
This rate will be over the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were no more successful than they are now.
The last amendment, which was adopted - the 27th - was approved in 1992, but it was actually introduced into Congress in 1789.
"Pobita, but not defeated," says Gifford in his first television interview after the attempt.
Ten months after an armed man shot at her at a public event in Tucson, a member of the House of Representatives, Gabriel Gifford (Democratic Party, Arizona), appeared on a federal channel on Monday night, sang a melody from the Broadway show "The sun will return" and said he wanted to recover more than return to Congress.
After showing up at the 20 / 20 programme, the BBC News with Diane Sawyer, Gifford made difficult proposals and needed help walking.
The program showed her difficult way to recover from a bullet injury that smashed the skull and broke the left side of the brain, passing from the front to the rear of the head.
Three months later, she had suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and had voted in a triumphant manner on the draft law on the ceiling debt.
In his first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang, and called his recovery "difficult."
On the question, Sawyer, how she felt, the 41-year-old Gifford said, "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hourly special issue of "20 / 20," which was shown on the eve of the new book of the spouses, "Gabby: A History of courage and hope."
The special issue reported on the recovery of the Gifford after the shooting on January 8.
On the video that Kelly made in the first few weeks, she's on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Gifford sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teach her how to do simple things.
To throw your head.
Expand your lips.
And then her first word is, "What."
A few days later, Gifford said the second word, "toast," asking me to change the breakfast menu.
The video shown by the BBC shows that music played a central role in the recovery of the Gifford: we see the congressman sing with the doctors "The Girls just want to party" Cindy Loper "and" The Free Fall "by Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer Gifford, who spent two hours a day on procedures, said he didn't remember the day of the attempt.
Her husband said that he had read an article in the newspaper about the shooting on 12 March when she stopped him to ask about the six that had been killed at the time.
The suspect, Gerd Lee Lafner, is being held in Missouri prison and subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
"A lot of people died," said Gifford Sawyer.
"It's hard, it's hard, it's hard."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said," Gabby, you're not defeated, "said Kelly.
You're just beaten.
And you're gonna get through this, you're gonna get better and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
The troops feel more pity than respect.
The event was a celebration on Wall Street, which raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock was singing a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Several hundred soldiers, seamen, pilots and Marines have been set up around it.
The audience in the tuxedo was a standing one.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Salzman, who organized a spring collection.
The senior military officer at the concert, which also included the then Chairman of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were treated like orphans," written by an officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
The very opposite is illustrated by the difficult relationship that has been established between the army and often indifferent, sometimes admired by the American public.
The troops are being commended for their sacrifices.
But the praises have their price, they say the military.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were feeling sorry for people in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who was in command of the forces in Iraq and is about to leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to treat us as unhappy."
It's a sensitive subject for warlords who don't want to be ungrateful or dissatisfied with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger experienced by the returning troops in recent years of the war in Viet Nam has been much worse.
As a result, most of the talk of pity is quiet and only between war veterans.
After two of his sons returned from the fighting in the Marines, the retired Colonel Mark Canaction warned them that people from outside the army would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration, because they have been raging the rebels and in exotic places.
Others will think that "under the mask of a violent veteran," said Canaction, who fought in Iraq and, when he returned, took up a high-level government post in Washington.
While he was looking for a job, he told me that he felt that some interviewers had been careful to ask if he would be able to withstand the tension of a responsible job in Washington immediately after the fight.
The nation recalls, as he said to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to count on a negative effect."
The incompetence experienced by the military is partly due to American indifference to war.
The victory on the battlefield is rarely praised by a country that is not familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism, as was entirely normal in World War II," said the Lieutenant General, in his resignation David Barnowe, who led the United States forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is mainly focused on the depth of the military's suffering.
The troops are estimated by the number of visits they have made, by the number of comrades they have lost or by the extent of the losses.
The army is facing increasing pressure from anti-rape supporters
This week, the historic court hearing must decide whether 28 men and women will be brought against the army on charges of non-response to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will be in line with the following.
Private first-class Elizabeth Lyman is 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant, she claims, was raped by her co-worker at night.
This was in October 2008, she returned to her barracks at Miramar airfield, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend, and met a male co-worker carrying a 12-bottle of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," said Lyman.
But Texas's mother-in-law has noted her concerns.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my instinct."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man came to her back, took her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will be waiting hard for a court decision at a historic hearing to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the action they brought against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rasmfeld, will be brought to court.
The claim states that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to deal with widespread violence in the army, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The complaint filed in February by Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., initially included 17 complainants, but increased to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or threatened with sexual violence by their co-workers and that the army has not properly investigated, prosecuted or provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeting the top men of the army because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy a cult of violence?" High management. "
Burke also said that, since February, she had been contacted by some 400 other victims, many of whom could be involved in future claims.
Her strategy is, instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, it will open up a lot of cases if it takes to maintain pressure.
The defence team from the Ministry of Defence, under the leadership of the Federal Prosecutor, Neil McBride, has taken steps to close the case.
The judicial documents that Newsweek received reveal the protection strategy, mainly that former or current soldiers are unable to file claims against the army for damage sustained in the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court decision, Doctrina Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by persons in military service.
"The alleged damage is a risk to the military service of the plaintiffs" is stated in the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially prohibited from participating in combat, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers & apos; teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contacts with local women in the war zone.
Result: 150 women soldiers, two thirds of them in combat, died between the two wars.
It's time for the army to become modern, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her claim, three others are being prepared.
At the Yale Law School, the Veteran Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academies on charges of promoting a feminist atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American war veterans in Viet Nam is preparing an action against the army, which focuses on the diagnosis of "personal change" for the victims of violence in order to remove them from service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Ana Bhagwati of a human rights group, the Organization for Action of Women Soldiers.
Her team filed an action against the Veteran Office in December, accusing it of discriminatory practices in dealing with applications for pensions from people who claim to have been at risk of sexual violence during service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were submitted to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Ministry of Defence & apos; s Sexual Violence Prevention and Control Service, 3,358 rape attempts were reported.
But it is known that attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this figure is approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also investigated the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases had reached the court, twice as much as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Burke case call attacks on them only the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported a rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
On that night, she said, she was asked to tell the details of the rape separately 11 times to the loyal police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the victim's blood, from a cut on her arm, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting before a judge at a hearing where she was asked whether she had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive description to the accused, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," said Lyman.
"I thought I was having a baby right now, I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I left, I remember my commander saying," It wasn't a trial against him, it was a trial against me. "
Lyman was ordered to address a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her identity change, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with negative language, which prevented her from obtaining any benefits.
Whether the case put forward by Lyman and her claim comrades is a complex issue, says John Terley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: "I believe they are in a position to move forward."
Between them and the verdict is the doctrine that has been criticized since it came into existence.
I've been criticizing Doctrine Feres my whole life.
The army has fallen behind for decades because it has no incentives and no deterrent means to impose responsibility.
He adds, "The odds are to a large extent against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favour, Burke, the plaintiff & apos; s lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform," she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens earlier.
The walls have eyes: How do researchers study you on Facebook?
Before being a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Bravik was a regular guy who presented his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Bravik, who had confessed to a mass murder in Norway in July, which had claimed 77 lives, appeared at his first public trial.
Although Bravik could have acted alone, he was far from alone on the network: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, talking to millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After a summer tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do we find them?
It's easy. I just need to get on Facebook.
"We realized it was not easy to get to them," said Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of the recently published report on the European Cyber-populism of the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The wealth of personal data on Facebook is so large, says Bartlett that researchers could easily use the site's promotional tool to highlight the necessary population group with scientific precision - that market scientists have been doing for several years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing group fans all over Europe and then gave them an ad, but instead of showing a new group or a diet product, it offered a user a survey that asked them about their level of education, about violence and optimism about their own future.
With Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 participants in 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries, even without leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," says Bartlett.
Some results are less striking: online supporters of right-wing groups are most often young men who are dissatisfied with immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with their offline activity are more reasonable, more democratic and less aggressive than those who only hide behind the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is only one example of how Facebook is becoming a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health to social trends, which are expressed in "Leikas," positions on the wall and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three records per day, Facebook's "super-relevant information" is a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles called the site in the heading by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it provides an opportunity to study people who cannot be approached on the street with a notebook.
"In the past, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have had to join the party and they would never have accepted you," Bartlett says.
"Facebook excludes all of this, you're talking to them directly."
Others say that the site could identify and study social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drunken works on Facebook were significantly more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that students, such as their dormitories, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often updates drunk status.
"You can't solve the problem without finding it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christ, co-author of Moreno and Director of the Centre for Child Health, Conduct and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We found a way to identify children at risk who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook also continuously extracts different types of data on its users.
The site & apos; s data processing team processed statistics on the status of relations and Valentine & apos; s Day, voter turnout in mid-2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (mainly using information that is available only to them, the cyberfreedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not, in exchange for an opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away from you, the site can process your personal data.
But how can it be when Facebook users become participants in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have well-defined rules for offline research, online data are available to the public.
"I don't think many users even thought that a researcher could watch their profiles," says Neil Selvin, a sociologist from the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using public pages of students in Facebook.
"As far as they could imagine, it was only between them and their friends."
The question of methodology then arises.
Even the offline has no guarantee that the object of the study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is not possible to know how much information is in the profile and on the user's page.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," said Selvin.
That is why, despite its years of work in technology research, Selvin thinks that the notebook and the pen are still the best research tools to use.
"Nothing can replace a way into the real world and a relationship with real people," he said.
"It is assumed that social research is about social research, and most social research still takes place offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Bering Bravik will be brought before a public court for the first time.
Anders Bering Braiwick, a man who confessed to a double attack that claimed the lives of 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during the first public appearance in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and Knights of the Tambier of Norway," he said in front of 500 present in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I admit my actions, but I don't."
Judge Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Braywick during this monologue because he "did not want to give Brayvik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Braivik, who had brought a written speech with him, to contact the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Braivik in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take all visits and correspondence under strict control for eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in hoping to look Bravik in the eye, others to make sure he was locked up.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," told the Norwegian NRK channel one of the survivors on Utoya.
"It was uncomfortable, but it made me feel a little better in person after I saw and heard the suspect."
In a dark suit and a blue tie, Bravik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors when he entered and left the building.
Despite Bravik's strange idea that he was part of a large "resistance" movement, the judge held that he was not crazy and said there was no evidence that he had acted with his accomplices.
Some may be satisfied that the attacks of 22 July seem to be the work of one extremist, not a radical group.
But it does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the entire nation is now feeling.
"I'd like him to look like a monster, but he's not," said a relative of one victim.
"It would be a lot easier if it were."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs's lost interview, which is at the theater this week.
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the great inventor of time.
But what Apple fans can think of as the greatest discovery in a recently discovered interview, which was recalled in the run-up to a preliminary show in the main markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and he thought he was a hippie, but he was also a thorough organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders had suffered from "a disease to think that a really great idea was 90 per cent of work... [but] a great idea from a great product separates a great amount of artificial work."
Back in 1995, Bob Cringley created the Triumph Nervde TV series about the arrival of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By then, it was about 10 years since Jobs was kicked out of Apple, and he was working all over his new NeXT computer company, waiting for the Internet to be developed on a massive scale.
While a small part of Kringley's interview was used in the Nerds, he says that the original interviews were missing on transport.
It was only after Jobs died that a full VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This filmed material, a little edited, was the basis for a 68-minute film by Steve Jobs: A Lost Interview, which is released on Landmark Theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man who is known for his hatred for a detailed interview, Jobs is not prepared to present his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In four different points in the interview, there are a wide range of questions and answers - 10-15 seconds of thinking, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also moments where Jobs's perectionism is going to the surface where he seems to be irritated by the questions of Cringley, which make him move more quickly to questions or things of greater importance.
There's something sinister about what he sees in the Picksar era, the ipods and the iphons of the Lost Interview, when Jobs assesses what he sees different companies do right and wrong and offers his own vision of the future of information technology.
It's one thing to read about the postmortem estimates of Jobs' work, but there's something vulnerable and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, a disquieting dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A small summary of seven significant findings of the lost interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All the time in the business, I always asked," Why are you doing this? "And the answers you always get are," Oh, that's just how it's done. "
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to streamline the reporting in Apple.
The cost-recording method, often started with "standard costs," which were taken off the ceiling and then "refined," created an automated structure that guaranteed that they would be able to track business costs up to little.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs details the "blue box" he made with Steve Verniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and call for free.
The device has been written a lot before, but Jobs' euphoria is here when you describe the blue box as an act of power-giving.
He tells us how he and Wynyak tested the box using a phone machine, ordering a conversation, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We've covered the Earth's ball half a dozen times, and you've been screaming at the machine phone, and it's been a minute later at the next machine," says Jobs with a laugh.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could master something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both knew a little, but we could do a little thing that could control a big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that without it, Apple could ever show up.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one of the famous events that he and Wynyak have almost managed by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking for the Pope's phone, trying to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to an American diplomat, these two were laughing right before the Pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
About the love of technology (and the cold call of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, he found Bill Hewlett in a phone book, and he called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a strong influence on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it formed my view of what a company is and how well they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of the staff members of HP who visited the research laboratories of Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer."
It was the size of a suitcase, he had a small monitor with an electronic ray tube, and I fell in love with him.
I used to go to the HP with a teenager, and I went around that car and I wrote her programs.
On improvised innovation:
In a few locations, Jobs' interview is about the invention of new products on the summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of installation fees, one buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
Working only 30 days on credit, he had to think of both assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later on in Apple, he remembers the difficulties he faced by developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the violent arguments... they yelled at me, that it would take five years to collect a mouse that would cost $300, and I was fed up and out, and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
The big energy-losing companies:
Long before he led Apple's recovery, Jobs clearly predicted how many industry leaders would be misrepresented and lost control of their market share.
"Suppose you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copy or printer, so what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company's not getting any more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who eventually come to the management of the companies and the people who make the product get out of the decision-making site.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolistic position is disenfranchised by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
He could be ten times more, could be a Microsoft of the '90s...
They were defeated by the victory.
Innovation as an art:
"A great idea from a great product separates a great amount of artificial work... when you're doing a great idea, it's changing and growing."
You'll learn a lot about her infinity.
There are compromises you need to make - some things you can't make electrons, glass, robots, or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head - these concepts - by bringing them all together...
In the end, it's all about taste - it's about trying to express itself in the best that people have ever done, and later, trying to bring it into what you do.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made McIntosh famous was that the people who were working on him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had become the best information technology professionals in the world.
If it wasn't for information technology, they'd be doing amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are having lunch with opponents of the health law while the court is considering the case.
On the day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether it would hear the challenge of the Health Act of President Obama, two of its judges, Antonio Scalia and Clarence Thomas, would be responsible for a lunch sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case before the highest court.
The case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petition submitted.
One case on the agenda was a motion supported by 26 states, challenging the rapid review of health care adopted by Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists from the entire nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; indeed, a five-hour / two-hour turning debate is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle to the presidential race, which will be at the very heart of the time when the judgement is made public.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the Health Act should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was the Deputy Attorney General during George W. Bush's presidency.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen firms that helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group that consistently defended conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was Pflizer Inc, a pharmaceutical giant who had a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the trial.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, a Republican leader in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the Health Act.
Honorary guests at dinner?
Nothing new: two judges have been attending the activities of the Federalist Society for many years.
This is not at all contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were to obey, they might fall under principle 4C of the Code, which states: "A judge may attend charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although a judge may not be a rapporteur, a guest of honor or a reference to such an event."
However, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, like a company with a great financial interest, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the Government.
"This staggering violation of ethics and the indifference to the code is contrary to the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the General Affairs.
"The judges had a drink and dinner at an official fund-raising event with lawyers who are currently being tried in court."
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for this event undermine all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly draw attention to critics who say that they are very willing to mix court cases with groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Jeannie, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, the conservatives claim that this is an ethical issue against Judge Elena Kagan, not Skalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in the Obama administration when the first judicial objections to the law were filed at the court level of first instance.
Her critics demanded that Kagan dispense with the case because she was too involved in the defence of the law to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show you she was going to do that.
Boeing gets a record 18-billion-dollar plane order.
Emirates is ordering 50 wide-fueled Boeing 777 and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, and the deal size is over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company is getting an order for 50 of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co., and the price for all of these 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
And so is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, the growing gold life of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest dollar-equivalent order for commercial aircraft, 50 two-way Boeing 777.
An unlikely order came from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has an opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, which will raise the total price of $26 billion, and declared Boeing on the Dubai Air Show 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which could be praised for much better fuel savings and passenger-friendly.
The price for six fixed-wing aircraft is more than $1 billion.
"This is really good for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neil Dior.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but also the increase in the price of fuel, which is usually detrimental to airlines, because it is one of the largest items of expenditure, not so bad, because the country is making money at high oil prices.
It's important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel the plane order when the prices rise, said Dior.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's leadership in the market for wide-fluorescent aircraft and helps prevent a rival of the Airbus SAS from encroaching on his domination with his A350 airliner.
Boeing's victory on the air show took place four months after Airbus declared that he would postpone the biggest A350, which competed with 777-300ER.
He postponed the depot to increase the point load after the buyers demanded an increase in the capacity and range of the flight.
Boeing Co's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico apparently lost in the elections in Michoacán.
Louise Maria Calderón claims that the drug traffickers were helping the opposition Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in an election race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister did not seem to have implemented her application for the seat of Governor of Michoacán during the violent State elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers had helped to push a race for one of her opponents.
As a preliminary result, the leader of the Western State Governor's race is called Fausto Vallejo, an institution-revolutionary party, or an IRP.
"The interference with organized crime during the entire electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán but also for the whole country," said Louise Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after the Sunday vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our employees in the elections... they took the ballot boxes, they made obstacles... and they made people vote" for the IRP.
The IRP administered Mexico for seven decades before losing its presidency in 2000.
She's preparing a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that attempt.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have just overdone Calderon, who was in charge of the ratings until election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or PDD, led by her brother, refused to recognize Valejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DPP, now owned by the Governor & apos; s chair, came third, a serious defeat for the divided and failed left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Valejo, a former mayor of the capital, Morella, denied links with drug traffickers and called on other candidates to accept the results.
In Michoacán, drug cartels have long been dominated, specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still continuing.
The MAP mayor was killed a week before the election, when he was campaigning for Louise Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local election race because of fear.
For the IRP, however horrendous the elections in Michoacán would be, the victory would be a driving force for the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the front door of next year."
ADB is convincing Asia to help save the eurozone.
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that will stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Managing Director of the ADB office in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing large economies should "do what they can" to accelerate the recovery of the currency unit through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties "impartially," and said that Asian financial assistance, side by side with European leadership and resources, could help to avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
"It's all about us."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he said Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invincible."
"So if China and India can help, it must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely affected by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's debt had increased dangerously, and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece had resigned.
The emerging debt crisis in Europe has created fears that it can again lead the world economy to recession, and has led to calls by the leading developing economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neig suggested that any Asian assistance would be provided through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of EU financial assistance fund bonds, the means to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provided a great deal of force in the negotiations to the Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Minister of Trade of India, said that "India will do its best" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and uncalm," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a possible option, it's a prerequisite, because where we find a job for tens of millions of our young men and girls."
Others argue that for developing economies like India, there is no point in helping rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashotos Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult, politically, to help Europe for Indian 1.2 billion people, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point, they will know that the Greeks retire at 50 and go to the sea for the holidays, and it will not be taken well," he said.
Lee Hovell, the Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to keep Greek many and well-paid public sector workers working in poorly organized, lost enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatened "significant direct consequences" throughout Asia.
The ADB's forecast of a 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011 / 12 is now facing "downside risks" due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to develop "emergency plans" to protect themselves from recession and significant outflows of capital from their economies.
Pentagon's fears of potential reductions in defence costs
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panette, has inflated the situation on Monday in Congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and lead to a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the fighting fields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already falling by $450 billion in the coming decade, but is now afraid that additional reductions of $600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress cannot reach an agreement on expenditures.
"The consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the Ministry," Panette said in a letter to the senators, Republican John McCain, Arizona, and to the republication of Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to accept the budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequester had led to a 23 per cent reduction in the total and the termination of many new projects.
"Such a strong reduction, which is so irrational, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you cannot buy three quarters of the ship or building -- and will seriously damage other attempts at modernization," Panette wrote to the senators.
"We will also have to fire many of our staff, and since the reduction will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to fire the staff to achieve our goal."
"These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and cause serious damage to operational readiness."
The cuts will eventually affect the military, said Panette.
"Although military funding in overseas emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequesters, military achievements will be seriously affected by a serious breakdown in core budgets," Panette warned.
"Contractual personnel will be reduced to end with the cancellation of contracts and the oversight contract that supports the troops."
"Staff will be reduced, resulting in late payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted."
Two senators wrote to Panette 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts at the Ministry of Defence.
"The result of a sequester in the Department of Defence will be the rapid fall of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We stand firm against these draconian actions," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday night when they released the letter of Panetta.
"It is not an option we can live with, and it is not an option that we must impose on ourselves."
"Secvester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen."
Whether the letter of Panetta or the latest senators' warnings will lead to a budget compromise or strengthen calls for the Pentagon to be free from cuts, we will see later.
Panette was very clear about possible reductions, although he had come to work in the Pentagon leadership after years of budget review in Congress and the White House, and was aware that he was facing difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence drew a dull picture of what could go on -- troops with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without seamen."
"It's a squad without bullets."
"It's the wing of a plane without trained pilots."
"This is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," said Panette in his opening remarks in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from an unstable fighting spirit, poor preparedness, and unable to fight potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression..."
In the annex to his letters to McCain and Graham Panette, he provided new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: slow responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously limit our ability to be the first to deploy and respond worldwide; and lead to unacceptable risks in future military operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects might be hampered, including those that have already passed the tests, and some are only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 fighter, a planned new bomber, a new generation of ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship and a new ground-based combat vehicle that the Army and the Marine Corps are required to replace the Hammer.
The cessation of further development and testing of F35 could save 80 billion dollars in 10 years, but its supporters say that this is a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats to China and other opponents.
How to catch a lie
A blind look at the recent headlines shows how serious and widespread deceit and lies are in daily life.
A Republican presidential candidate, Herman Kane, is engaged in challenging allegations of sexual harassment by several women; each party is accusing the other of lying.
The administration of the University of Pennsylvania was charged with perjury because they were allegedly hiding that a retired football coach had raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar when the microphone was on.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
Congressman New York and Internet-based exhibitor Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself, denying his outbursts, which was quickly refuted by uncontested evidence.
A former presidential candidate, John Edwards, was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to hide out of wedlock.
Again, none of those who lived at that time would ever forget a media circus with President Bill Clinton, found lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinsky during his second term.
The story of fraud at school and college exams is common.
There have been cases in which teachers have responded to the tests for students to have a good assessment of their performance.
The proponents who must teach the contrary send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies are we facing?
In one day, research shows you can lie between 10 and 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie of salvation.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
The identification of lies or evidence of lies is a necessary skill for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game like, say, a charade where to say "Gotcha!," the identification of lies is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been broken.
Liars look in the eye.
They don't always fit in, put on, blush or fade.
It is not necessary to conclude from this that the liars are difficult to see and to expose.
An experienced liar can reach the truth by observing the structure of allegations, myths, the structure of questions and the temporal characteristics.
I have spent several years studying scientific discoveries in an extensive and ever-growing segment of knowledge about lies, and it is clear that the identification of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps to guide in our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are very good at reading others, making them feel uncoerced, managing their own emotions and intuitive about how others perceive them.
We know from the study that the exverts lie more than the introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women are more about others, usually to protect someone's feelings that married people are less lying to their partners than the unmarried ones (but the lies they say are most likely to lie).
We also know that if you're perceived as a deceitful, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, watch your object's normal behavior.
It's called "determination of the baseline."
This helps to provide a starting point for the assessment of changes further.
Watch the position, the laughter, the voice characteristics of your object.
It would be good for you to know if a man is always on his feet in a normal state, then you will not bring an unfair charge when you see a foot-stabbing in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for a group of deceptive notes and non-verbal acts.
treat these groups as red flags, not evidence of deception.
The deceiters can record the top of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their feet in the direction of the door, bend to the exit, change their position in a certain way, or show "relief after an interview" -- this exaggerated breath of relief and a change of position when all the difficult issues are behind.
Investigators often falsify the end of the interrogation to just look at this relief after the interview.
So, look at your object's speech.
It is known that Scott Peterson has overturned and used the past time, claiming that his murdered wife is alive, leading to her search throughout the country.
Convicting people can also use a distance in a speech, "I didn't have a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Levinsky," or repeat the complex question completely.
The most typical note indicators are unlikely to be found.
Someone can use "qualified language" when they answer a difficult question: "Well... truth be told... as far as I know... as far as I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magic to detect a lie, but you can learn how to detect a deceit.
These skills will increase the chances for everyone not to be the victim of skilled crooks in professional and personal life.
The disputed pipeline plan needs to be revised after the US threat to postpone its approval.
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which had provoked the anger of trade unions, but had calm environmental defenders, a company that was about to build the pipeline, claimed that it would be willing to review the project in order to resume its work.
TransCanada reported on Monday night that it would remove the planned oil pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of the Nebraska Peshi hills and was sure that the project would still be approved.
The company made this decision at a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
TransCanada's official, Alex Purbas, said that the company remained confident that it would eventually be approved for the pipeline, although with another route.
This is following a statement by the State Department last week that it will defer a decision on the project at the federal level until it examines new possible routes that do not affect the area of the Nebraska and Ogalala Peshi hills, a vast underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said the Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental assessment commissioned by the Department of State is likely to postpone the decision until 2013 after the elections next year, although the authorities denied that the decision was involved in the policy.
Obama, in a written statement last week, referred to the decision as a call by the State Department and expressed support for it.
A 1 700-mile oil pipeline should extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It must transfer 70,000 barrels a day from Alberta to oil refineries in Texas.
To do that, he needs to cross six states.
He is hated by environmental defenders, but is loved by trade unions that hope for approximately 20,000 oil-related jobs.
But Nebraska's anti-plan legislators are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Peshay Hill and the Ogalala Aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study of the State Department on environmental impact showed that the project would have only a limited adverse impact on the environment, but the energy source stated that the Department's auditor had ordered a separate review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Eliotte, who was an adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the programme.
Another is whether the choice of the firm that was hired for the initial study was not appropriate because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patty LaBelle was sued for allegedly causing a child to be nauseous for fear.
A family from New York claims that Patty LaBelle's disco-couch began to go into the lobby of their home in Manhattan, scaring their little daughter to the point where he was sick of fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" tyrada scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she had suffered "personal change, sleep disorder" and "great fear of strangers," said her family at the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It happened on November 10, last year, when Kevin Monk's work scene, his wife, the kindergarten teacher, Rosanne, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanne Monk went down to the lobby of the building on the Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanne Monk said she stopped by the door and let her daughter down for a minute.
"Someone came to me from behind and said," Do you know what your daughter is doing? "" I said yes and went to take her, "she said.
LaBelle is angry with a woman who is pregnant.
"She said aggressively," You shouldn't have left your daughter by the door, "said Rosanne Monk.
"I told her," I'm not interested in what you say or think. "
She came into anger and began to use the wiggles -- the word on C and the word on F -- on the high...
She had a bottle of water, and she started putting water out of a bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I said to this woman," Look what you did to my daughter, "said the child's mother.
LaBelle attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her escorts had to hold her and break into the waiting car, said Rosanne Monk.
The little one cried so hard, she puked, she added.
The family later sent LaBelle a note of apology but did not receive a reply.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle do not respond to the calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage was not reported, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he had taken up the case free of charge and that the family was planning to donate any money that would be paid for the charity of children with cancer.
"The goal is to make Patty LaBelle take responsibility for his actions," said Davis.
"Such behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child in his hands."
Climate problems have slowed the economy down.
During the first year of the rule of Mario Lopez, unemployment and the illegal labour market increased in Sinaloa, foreign financing fell and the economy was weakened.
2011 - a year that will enter the economic history of Sinaloa as the first year-related Government of Mario López Valdes, also known as the year of change, which has given rise to great hopes for economic development, but given the adverse climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but there has been a decline in key economic development indicators.
The low temperatures of February have not only led to the loss of millions for the agricultural sector, but have limited the growth of the public economy, resulting in a reduction of 3.6 per cent in total economic activity in the first half of the year, mainly due to a historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on areas affected by the frost provided by the Council for Sustainable Rural Development of Mexico, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were affected in whole and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected, with vegetables, maize and waste being the main crops affected.
The decline in economic activity caused, until November, a steady increase in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters, an accelerated increase in the unemployment rate was recorded, from January to March 55,053 Sinaloa residents were unemployed, with a share of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, the share increased to 5.28 per cent in the second quarter, and from July to September it continued to 6.19 per cent, an increase of over 74,000 Sinaloa, an increase of 18,969 over the first half.
Liquidity reduction
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year has been discussed by many factors, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the increase in unemployment can be attributed indirectly to actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which is associated with several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market to limit the resources imposed by the law that was adopted in Congress to combat money-laundering, because it is difficult for people who are illegally in possession of dollars to work with, invest and use them in something," he said.
Immigration stopped
Lopez Cervantes said that there was also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state for work abroad was limited in the United States, primarily because of entry difficulties, and, second, because once they entered, they already face very many difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people remain and demand jobs here in the state, as a result of the increase in unemployment," he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is becoming worse when attention is drawn to the large number of labour-dominated violations, according to INEGI, that 60,.38 per cent of the active population of the State is working without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and job irregularities, a further reminder of work in the State is provided by low wages; in the State, the lowest wages in the country, according to records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,552 pesos until September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos.
FDI reduction
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate in 2011, the Ministry of Finance reported the largest foreign direct investment outflows in the last 10 years that from January to July, state FDI amounted to $630,697, a decrease of 87.74 per cent, compared with $5,543,312 in the same period last year.
For its part, the Department of Economic Development of the State Government recorded only 17,280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which was mainly made available to service companies.
Debt
In the context of the economic downturn, the State Government requested, during the State Congress in July, the approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos that would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos had been approved at the local level, and until November no sector of the State economy had expected debt benefits.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdes shows a lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that there was a lack of agreement on the wishes of various sectors, including the State Government itself, during 2011.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year has been really low, we have to work hard to recover the positions lost this year, we have to redouble our efforts in 2012, we have not been able to agree on the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
Lopez Loredo said that events such as early frost have stopped the state economy this year and its efficiency and growth have been limited.
"The low levels of the economy are the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy that is not becoming fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations," he said.
Revision of direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employers of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to continue its most dynamic production activity.
"In general, we have found that we have been working on this, we believe that a long-term programme must be developed that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction in order to better guide the Government & apos; s efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration had shown progress in its own manner of public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is beginning to get involved, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government is aware that much more needs to be done," he said.
He's being sentenced for 8 kilograms of marijuana.
Five years of prison and a 100-day fine of income, such a sentence was imposed on a citizen of Navolato for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Office of the Attorney-General reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, was convicted of a crime against health, in this case possession of marijuana for distribution.
According to case AP / SIN / CLN / 687 / 2010 / MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010, during patrols on the street of Kipriano Valdés, in front of post No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white car with a pickup truck, carrying a black bag in a box in a car, and a small backpack in a passenger seat, where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seized person was transferred to the Second District Court and the accused continues to be detained at the Centre for the Legal Consequences of Crime.
We have to make contributions to work.
Public works related to programmes such as the homeland, the saving of public spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of being incomplete or long-term delayed due to a lack of funds, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that, although work programmes had been developed so far, they were at risk because the State Government was unable to make appropriate contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent was required, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for work, so that it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they didn't give us a penny when they were supposed to give us a part from the beginning of July," he said, "to not delay, we started work and they're very advanced, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not made the contributions it had to make, so at the beginning of its term of office, the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that had not been provided in the case of the State administration.
"This happened to us in the previous administration because the state had no financial capacity to participate, and the programmes continued to develop, and this year, in order to have access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what remains of the state," he explained.
While the State authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareala, to increase efforts so that interest relating to them would come as soon as possible.
"They must make almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they have not given us a penny."
The Court will approve the "transition to digital television" in Mexico in 2015.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court (Supreme Court) rejected the constitutional claims put forward by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which postponed the so-called "digital television transition" from 2021 to 2015, as there were no eight votes required for its cancellation.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his mandate by issuing a decree detailing the actions for the transition to digital ground television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of the eight votes required for the court to speak on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme is a right under the law of the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Saldzar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to challenge the decree and to support the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned therein with regard to the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the draft in the sense that the federal executive could not determine the general rules for action to be prepared by the public administration.
"I also do not believe that if this were to happen, it would have an impact on the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that planning public policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, the administration of the State.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals - one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years - has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, he said, would have meant postponing the benefits of the transformation into a digital form that included meeting public needs, which had not only a technical dimension, "because it covered economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he said, "require the work of the entire system of State economic management, including a group of authorities, which the Constitution unites into the State executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and had done so with the help of the executive, despite the existence of specialized technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded from this that the Government, in adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of the Congress, ensures that laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly are enforced in the administrative sphere, he said.
In Michoacán, the possibility of counting "voice behind voice" is being analysed.
According to the data transferred to the PDP, the difference between the first and second seats in the Governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 of the total of 6,074 protocols.
The possibility of counting a voice-by-voice is real with regard to the election process this year in Michoacán, where, according to data from the Provisional Electoral Results Programme (PRI), the difference between the first and second seats in the Governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 of the total of 6,074 protocols.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Michoacana Electoral Institute (IVM), Maria de Los Angeles Lyandral Saragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral corps had adopted a set of principles to harmonize local rules with the federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacán did not adopt the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Law Act, as the State Congress approved reforms shortly before their entry into force in this electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not include its publication within the time-limits specified in the Act in the State Official Gazette, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJ) decided on a constitutional claim made by the local legislature and declared "null and void and illegal" the voice of a State representative for constitutional reform, since he is not entitled to "permit or support them."
In an interview on the possibility of a "voice behind a voice," Maria de los Angeles Lianderal argued that, with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council, it would be possible to present a partial or full count of votes by a local electoral body.
For example, a partial recalculation of one or more electoral boxes may be made on the condition that: the results of the protocols do not match; there is no voting record and the counting of documents in the urn or is not available to the President; or where there are obvious errors or corrections to the record.
In addition, there may be a general recalculation of votes in all election boxes when there is a sign that the difference between the proposed candidate for the election in question and those who obtained the second seat is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from a representative of the party and / or coalition that made the second of those candidates.
The total vote will also be recounted if, at the end of the normal counting, it is determined that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took second place is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate has taken second place, in the event that the ballot boxes that have been taken into account in the partial recalculation are excluded.
It is worth noting that in this situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the PRRA, the difference between the first and second places is only 0.16 per cent, even with 129 votes out of a total of 923.
His last will.
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, and his family will be confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Basio Cortes arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on the evening of Sunday; an examination and a late mass were conducted on Monday.
According to the family, the last will of the Lieutenant Colonel was for his ashes to be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam.
After receiving condolences with other people who had died in the disaster, the Basio Cortes family returned to the capital, Koahuila, on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, and the closest people attended a ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, a lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at a chapel on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz García, where his family and friends arrived.
At 5: 30, after noon, he was examined by the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and a football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member during his secondary school.
"His wish to return to Saltillo, and for his ashes to be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama, he always said it to his family and friends," that's what Sandra Cortez Basio, the pilot's sister, said.
In her view, the Lieutenant Colonel had fulfilled all her dreams, she believed that he had been at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother loyal to his family."
Felipe Cortez Basio is very young and has left the city of Saltillo to enter the College of Aviation in Sapane, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe him, they said he had a head, even in a truck, but he always wanted to fulfil his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew, Jorge Alberto Davila Basio, remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to welcome him as when he brought Marta Saagun to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapan for a certificate ceremony with his relative, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in his life: driving a plane.
He's being taken to the last place.
The shooting was carried out in honour of the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortez Bassio, headed by the Governor, Jorge Torres López, people from the village and government of the State, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Saltillo Technology High School, where he was studying in 1985 and had made progress in both education and sports, on his last journey.
Bacio Cortes was recently killed when the helicopter he was running was hit, together with the Provincial Secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all the representatives of that Ministry.
At 18: 05, the remains of Basio Cortez (cremated), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral bureau to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major James Martínez, to an e-training school where he was already waiting for his family, including his daughter, Amanda and his wife, Christine, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies were found abandoned on the NL Cadereit farm
A few hours before being found, the military authorities had shown 11 persons in the media who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found dead in various parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Kadereit Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The track was found 1.5 kilometres from the Kadereit road towards Santiago, at an outpost in a commune known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed noticed that the gate was open in a village house with a wall painted in beige and brown.
When they looked inside, literally three metres, they found the bodies of three people, they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the men was dressed in a yellow T-shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and there was another man in a white shirt next to him.
The body of the other person, in a red shirt and blue jeans, was almost one metre away.
All three were face-down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there were no casings.
There are signs on the fence of a village house addressed to one organized criminal group of another, and there are several bullet holes in it and in the gate.
11 caught in the Cardeite.
The Ministry of National Security represented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group, which was mainly in the municipality of Kadereit, and who were accused of kidnapping, murder, "fraud" and secret graves.
According to information published, eight persons were initially detained in the Los Alvero colony on 11 November, and one person who was held hostage was saved.
They were provided with three houses and a phone, demanding that they become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event took place on 12 November at 6: 00 a.m., when military personnel carried out a patrol in the village of Old Rancho in Kaderite when they saw a car with no license plates with two men in the parlor.
By stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, following these statements, one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Truth on 13 November at 2 p.m., who, after seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is charged with secret graves in the municipalities of Heneral Teran, Hina and Kadereit.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce a new Government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the brink of economic disaster.
The Italian Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monty, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to represent a new Government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of an economic disaster and has damaged the entire eurozone.
The statement from the Presidential Palace said that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected that he will present the Cabinet, which is composed mainly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will take up its positions.
Monty said he would present to the President the results of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form a Government.
"I wish to reaffirm my full confidence in our country's ability to get out of this difficult period," said the former European Commissioner to the reporters.
Monty did not say explicitly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is well defined now," he said.
Monty has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy has been fighting the political and financial crisis that has brought their debt to a critical level.
The administration, under the leadership of former European Commissioner Monty, must approve the austerity package required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
On the basis of the pressure on Monty to hurry, volatile markets have set the BTP of Italy at 10 years more than 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegalia, the leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told the reporters after meeting with Monty, "We said we would actively support this government."
We believe that this Government is Italy's last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party, Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said the reporters Angelino Alfonso, the secretary of the centric-right party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the government majority of the technocrats that Monty is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monty Government must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular reforms of austerity.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks increased pressure, warning that Monty's failure could be a disaster.
Monty began consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with young people & apos; s and women & apos; s organizations.
He's gonna end up with a few of his meetings on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on the Sunday of Napolitano, who allowed a very rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would retire, the value of Italy's debt had now reached a critical level, given the uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would be successful.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern financial defenders of the eurozone.
Monty said that his Government would exist before the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite widespread projections that politicians would only allow it time to reform before the new elections were scheduled.
Monty said that he would like to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insist that it should be made up of only technical experts, an indication of their dissatisfaction with the financial situation affecting the process.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and opposition by the parties made it difficult to include political figures.
The Spaniards have more game experience than Tikos.
Of the 22 players declared in Spain, 10 have already played 50 international games.
For Costa Rica, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 games.
A small contrast with Costa Rica, compared to 22 players called by both countries for a partnership match today at 3: 05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and Europe champions, number one in FIFA's monthly rating, have a list of class A selection games, Tricolor has only a defender, Michael Uman, as the only one who has conducted 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernandez stadium.
Spanish football players, who play in the League of All Stars and in the strong clubs of the Prime League of England, have been very active in the League and in local puppet competitions this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cup and Champions League.
To this should be added the experience of the Spanish Fury in the complex skills of the Euro or the World Cup.
Tikos, however, has limited international experience in an area like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest in FIFA.
We see that we are leading the list in the Spanish holoquier Iker Casillas, who, last Sunday against England (a 0-1 game in London), repeated the record of ex-Golkiper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international games.
Casillas will play against Tricolor today and set a new record in 127 international games for Spain.
Javi Hernandez, Barcelona player, 106 games.
Casillas and Javi were found to be the best UEFA player last week, along with another player of the Iberian team, Subisarreta, with 126 matches and a 102-man Shalke Raúl González.
It is almost approaching a hundred Charles Puyol with 97 games.
Javi Alonso follows them from 91, Fernando Torres from 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both from 81, Andrés Inyesta from 62, Sesk Fabregas from 61 and David Silva from 53.
On the side of Costa Rica, near Michael Umana, the left side of Hunior Díaz with 48 matches and the bombing of Brian Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only five have reached the limit of 30 games: Kailor Navas from 31, Randall Asofaif from 32, Michael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Hernández from 36, and José Luis López from 35.
The rest.
More than 30 games in Spain at Gérard Pica (37), Sergio Busquez (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
In the team with less than 30 exits on the field, there are Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Mury with 23.
The others didn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Morel has only four, and Hordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica, Victor Bolívar has only one, Alman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
The leading Spanish player, David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres from 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz became the one who brought more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernández and three times as Roy Mury and Parks.
Quintet included the country on a 20-year tour.
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream. "
In an exclusive interview with Viva Basist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, the band said that it was ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the group says that it is also a dream for them, which has become a reality, to play in that country.
It was an allegation by a bassist and founder, Jeff Amena, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The Group is on South America & apos; s territory as part of a 20-year tour and on Sunday, 20, will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium from 7: 30 p.m., together with the team from Los Angeles The X and the local group Las Robertas.
It's a piece of a conversation that is fully decrypted online in The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans, is this a real dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true for us, too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and so far it's going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once -- on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're very happy to bring our music there.
I ask that because there is some loyalty to the group; fans live in tension the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat him like the biggest show of the year.
Does that add some tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've been playing over the past 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We had a few great shows in São Paulo, and we hope that it brought us into shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we like surfing and jungle, with respect to these two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and her surfing waves?
We have a lot of surf friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as Mexico, are great surfing places, that's how we learned about it, from people who like surfing.
When you look at the tour, you can say that you made a great show with a lot of songs.
What are you planning on doing in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible with a variety of songs; we will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a great variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How do you do that?
I think part of it is because we have nine plates and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in a tone and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we might have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting to us, and that's why I think it makes it more interesting to people.
This is a 20-year tour.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I think none of us could ever imagine that we would be in a rock band and that we've been doing this for over 20 years made it look like a dream.
We are happy with our luck, and we are very encouraged that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and we love to make music.
We're happy to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
For us, things are working out very well.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the brink?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great groups.
We're good friends with the Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, one group from the same city appears, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and honoured to be part of a group from Seattle.
I'm still playing with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them and we're honoured to be part of Seattle's sound.
It's also very strange that a group like yours has been together for so long.
Yeah, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is much longer in itself than many groups.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second, we take care of others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, have also opened music roads that give everyone freedom of experiment.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't be better.
Your attitude to the word of glory was difficult; but thanks to your success, you were able to do everything you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
When we grew up, it made it easier to find a balance.
We care not to be on the tour too long, because it's easy to get into this game by a big crowd and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what you did without deciding to be famous and be a rock star, what none of us really care about.
What do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs, and at the beginning, it was great.
We were a band for almost three years, and we didn't release a single album until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of disappointment, because it took so long, and the most important thing is that we are still close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or see a picture, I think of the incredible man that Andy was, and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh, to talk about music and football and so much more.
It was a great man, and we miss him.
The local group Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that's why you chose her to open it?
Yeah, the producers sent us a few video proposals, and it was a group that we liked the most, so we can't wait to see that Las Robertas can offer live, and that should be very exciting.
Why do you always change words on the Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He's singing it, and I think he's using the first thing that comes to his head.
Who affected you as a bass player?
There are so many.
The first to come to mind, Giser Butler, John Entwisl, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them that I can talk all day about the basists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of the grant, even though it's no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little distracted from the word grange.
When I think about him, he reminds me of the groups I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came at the same time, and if that's important now, I think it's wonderful, because it's music that's worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoney are making music better than ever.
At first, your music was more gloomy, and now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are some songs on the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they may sound a little positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs are very dark.
I think that when you grow up, and there was some kind of trauma in your life, and you lost a family member or a friend, these events are beginning to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So I think you can be a happy man and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical examination.
The ex-president, Alberto Fujimori, was hospitalized on Tuesday at the public hospital, and his family doctor informed him of the loss of muscle in his legs.
Fujimori, aged 72, who is sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including the cancer of a language that has led to his operation four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginiga, his personal doctor, told TV channel N that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Non-Phostic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of power in his lower limbs.
Aginiga said that he believed that Fujimori should be a candidate for the benefit of pardons for humanitarian reasons; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew that he was innocent.
He carried four operations into language cancer, lost 18 kilograms in weight, and added other diseases, such as a strong erotic gastritis, pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems with the bleeding in his legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Police Office of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years & apos; imprisonment for the murder of 25 persons by the army & apos; s destruction unit, which had been acting in secret during the first years of his reign.
Muhika is going to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by President José Muhika of Uruguay and composed of several ministers and businessmen will come to Mexico on this Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to start negotiations on the political issues of the region.
The Muhika will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, the most important item in the broad plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by the Uruguayan authorities.
The meeting of the two Presidents in the city of Guadalahara will be "conducive to the exchange of information on the issue of political relations between the two nations," as published by the South American leadership on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is seeking support for Calderon for Uruguay in an incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in the tax harbor list at a meeting of G20 in the French city of Kanne.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remained tax havens, a statement that had been protested by Uruguay and withdrawn for consultations by his Ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 group of the most developed and developing countries since November, and has an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has tried in recent years to expedite the conclusion of tax exchange agreements to leave this grey list of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, drawn up from countries that do not use international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had the Free Trade Agreement (STS) in force since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
"Super Mario 3D Land" will be three-dimensional.
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil Bozer legs, but never before did it in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will be available in shops around the world this month, is based on the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows three dimensions to be played without the need to use points.
"Mario is a hero who must report how stereoscopy will work without glasses," said the head of the Nintendo press service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game, specially designed for this platform," because until now successful products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" were adaptations to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo said that, despite the existence of the 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "accessible" video game that allowed for a rapid and mobile game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one part: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once started, most experts will go "on the second round" to the levels of the game that are more complex this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or the one that only affects the depth of the action, but on which it is necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome a variety of obstacles and "avoid optical illusions."
This Super Mario invasion of three dimensions also marks the return of a hero to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo is winking at the fans of the show and repeating a successful formula from previous games, a mustache plumber needs to go through dangerous mined platforms to release Princess Peach.
However, the player will find new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as Luigi's "playing."
Kol guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process for Alfonso Portillo had begun to be held accountable in the United States for the $70 million conspiracy.
This is the end of the process in which Guatemala responded to a request from the northern country, which requested the extradition of Portillo to try him there.
At a press conference, Kol said that his decision was related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, given that the court of first instance had already signed an extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he had not "put his hands" to legal decisions and accepted all extradition procedures he had ever known.
Together with Portillo Sergio Ruano Marrokin, he will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Parédez, both for drug trafficking.
What has been done by the Court shows the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted to prosecute the ex-head of State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (COP), Portillo will be extradited once, with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and the guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent in the Q120 million embezzlement at the Ministry of Defence during the presidential period, a pre-extradition process, but the Ministry of Public Affairs appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support organization are important: 6,000 young people who are socially excluded have helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter century.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs were created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for the outcome of a ceremony held at the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove was born near Trinitat Vella in 1986 to help young people with lack of education, lack of employment and drug problems or marginalized.
Yesterday's Sant Andreu celebration brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have been working with the association for 25 years.
The different political representation during the elections showed a common feature of the work done by Trinijove.
After the President of the Generalitha, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Hordi Puhol, an ex-consultant of the Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and an ex-lieutenant mayor and an Eco-socialist member of the municipal council, Ricardo Goma, attended the ceremony.
It also appeared in Fabra I Coats, the current social welfare and family adviser, Josep Lewis Cleris and SEO Social Work of La Caixa, Haum Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove had come into being at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far "was a good basis."
The Chairman referred to Trinijove as an example of the fight against bad circumstances and the creation of hope for people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not new to the organization and work done to it," he said.
The occupied building, where the mass parties were organized, was evacuated
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51.
12 of the occupiers left the building at noon yesterday without fighting.
It seems that the nightmare of the neighbors living in house 51 on Balmus Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building at noon voluntarily, which they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that were annoying to their neighbours, by court decision without police intervention.
When the operation was over, the door lock was changed to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, there will be a traffic control," said the manager.
The squatters who took 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the others were settled, all the electricity and part of the water were taken away, and they drew walls and left traces of various kinds, especially alcohol-based banks.
The first three floors were a mass party site, which lasted up to two days and annoyed the owners.
There is a nightclub right outside the building, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, reported to Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income had fallen by 80%.
The club's owner says that the building's invaders got her into an unfair competition because they were selling drinks for three euros, compared to 10 in the club.
In addition, the discotheque owner had to respond to the noise complaints of the neighbours, although she noted that the noise was not caused by the visitors to the club but by the squat and, above all, by those who attended the parties that had been organized there, the frequency and intensity of which had increased, as said by the angry neighbours.
The club owner said that the inconvenience was so big that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months now, he's been "forgiving" her rent.
The city police also confirmed that more complaints from neighbours had been received in recent weeks.
The Chairman of the municipal group PP, Counsellor Alberto Fernand Díaz, demanded last week "the immediate evacuation of the building in order to address the problems of coexistence and the common spirit of the neighbours and the deterioration in this area."
The popular leader explained that, before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but in the last few months, squatters had invaded all the floors and almost every room, and that some had been hacked.
In that sense, he added that "there is a need to put an end to impunity and to stand up to the culture that is taking place in the building."
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the building at Noe Barris.
At 15: 30, the police left for Montral Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of a competition after a request for contributions
The 16-door municipal competition resumed debate on the role of Colcerola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the rise of the current Barcelona Capital Corporation (UXO), the administration printed a Prom-Filler for Colserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a big park in the capital of Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison in the pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the UXO, in 1987 the park again took a place in the consciousness of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that is not directed north-south but up (mountain) down (sea).
The position of Colserola as a natural park is contrary to that idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but the Yellowstone, with the wild boar as the bear of Yoga.
This was the case until, in September, the council announced a huge competition, consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates at Colserol.
The gate means the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
The question is, Colserola, Park or Mountain?
The competition, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, is a topic for discussion among all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most recurring subject to be discussed when two members of this clan of elected people recognize each other in an elevator.
And that fact is one of the few coincidences between what the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present say.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Baion: The competition is appropriate
For Roldan, once the coastline has been reached, it becomes "necessary" to discuss the "front side of the mountain" when the proposal of Ildephon Serda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"We must assume that Barcelona's largest park is a beach.
Among other things, thanks to its excellent availability.
Colserol is more complex, "says the architect, for which the title" the Colserola gate "contains a" word trap ": we should not think of them" as an entry to the park, but as a limitation on certain areas where we must act. "
Modolo, as Roldan and Bahia with experience in urban development, called the proposal "intellectual task" with "some dangers."
Risks arising from the "uncertainty of public space forecasting" following the experience of the '80s, which ended on the Forum site with a "lewd song."
The first fear is the very limitation of borders where you can build.
"The limitation of something is the preparation of the next step," that is, a transition.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because current [as regards the capital master plan (CSP)] can lead to real trouble."
To the point, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Kolserola Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not as a" purely topographic question.
Modolo recalls that there is work done outside of Calcerola that "should not be missed by the ears," although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers his profession to join the project "from the beginning."
Moreover, it is understood that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is the one that should lead multidisciplinary teams ("success," he claims) that were to create: "Architects should be only a tool."
Bahia suggests that the answer to the question that the name of this part is asking is complex because the rules of the competition lack a common species of Colserola: "16 cross-border competitions have been announced," he says, from the point of view of the sea-mountain, but there is no long-term reading to see and understand the area as a whole. "
This has led at least to a decision by 16 competitions in his case.
On the other hand, a project for one gate can cross through a program and a definition with an architect project for the next gate.
In your view, the board has to guarantee that the strip directly above the Rhonda de Dult should provide, in its entirety, an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released.
After 72 days of settlement, the court representative of Red Casino forgave his brother, Mayor Monterrey, in a trial against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be free after the legal representative of Red Casino has given him forgiveness before the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting a process of extortion against the brother of Mayor Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale bombing, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly requested his economic contribution to allow the Monterrey authorities to allow a secret operation in the gambling house.
After a public conviction, the Public Prosecutor opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on 2 September, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours before an agent of the State Ministry of Crime on inheritance, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the State capital.
He remained in that place for 49 days, following the provisions of the second order prohibiting displacement after the prosecutor had ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kadereita for allegedly extorting half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in a prison with an average degree of isolation because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving at the San Nicholas municipal prison in Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest order was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that, after almost two months of investigations, proof of Jonas's guilt was sufficient, such as the charging of 1.5 million pesos from the Bumpkers in exchange for the authorization of the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gomez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to seek clemency for the brother of the mayor of the region, so he could have been released in the next hours.
During the trial, the public prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether he had paid for the damage and which of the partners in the gambling house would grant a pardon, although the lawyer had tried not to give a name.
On the basis of record 197 / 2011, a legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and no statements could then be made about the process that had been planned against him; nor would any compensation or punishment be required.
Following the hearing of the legal representative of the bookers, at almost 3: 50 p.m., the immediate release of Larrasabal Breton was ordered.
The court officer, Jorge Janes, went to the San Nicholas prison in Garza to inform Yonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionicio Pérez Jacomé is talking about the details of the disaster in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, died, and seven others.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MCT) reported that the results of the unfortunate incident in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others, had been killed had shown that the helicopter had hit the land directly in full integrity without the pilot's attempt to make an emergency landing.
During a press conference by Dionicio Pérez Jacomé, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"The elements that appear to show that the vessel had several contacts with the ground, the wings made contact with the trees at 25 metres where the device lost its fluorescent."
He also stated that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, and accordingly it met the necessary requirements for the transport of persons.
He also said that studies carried out in the area of impact did not report any parts on the ground.
"The study reports that there are no components of the vessel in another place, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the requirements for the transport of passengers.
The land in this place has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
To date, the Secretary has said, the main point is to obtain results as soon as possible; however, the study may take a few months or even one year.
In the meantime, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the attack, a presidential helicopter had been operated at a cruiser speed and that it had occurred on a soft, rising ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal summer manoeuvre at the time of impact," he said.
At a press conference, the owner of SCT, Perez Hakomé, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation regulations, the flight was conducted according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the team must be visible during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AIMS reports identified suitable conditions for taking off when the aircraft went to the border between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where low-altitude clouds were observed.
Selected routes:
It is possible that, due to the cloud conditions, the team was looking for an area of lower altitude and greater visibility in the Cuernawak Valley.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last entry from the radar of the aircraft are likely to be the same before the impact there was no loss of control or change of direction.
Spread of debris in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact was on the front and side lines.
The dispersion of the debris makes it clear that the helicopter has been exposed to land in a structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion were found:
In the area of disaster, there remains unfound evidence in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent studies have shown that there may be multiple contacts with the land.
During work on the ground, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,200 feet above sea level, and the ground has a range of 7 degrees to 30 degrees.
The images show the sequence in which it was destroyed on the way.
The information contains facts that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had several clashes with the ground.
After a thorough study on a larger area than the defined area near the location where the disaster occurred, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, thereby strengthening the assumption that the impact took place in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS declares the obesity gene search program.
Social protection leads a study on the search for the obesity gene of children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) announced that it was conducting a study to identify the obesity gene of children and young people, which had been called the protocol "Obesity genetics in childhood and adolescence," which would provide an estimate of the signs of overweight.
In his statement, Miguel Cruz Lopez, Head of the Medical Research Unit for Biochemistry of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the 21st Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietologists and social workers had been assembled.
The team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Health Institute (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
The study invited the population (written or not) to participate in the MSSI sports centres participating in the study to the Mexico Valley, where children will be tested every Saturday, from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m..
He stressed that the protocol had begun to be maintained at the sports centre in Kuala Lumpur (western Mexico State) and that, since 8 October, activities had been held at the sports centre in Nesahualkoyotle (eastern Mexico State).
Once the goal of involving between 500 and 600 children has been achieved, the study will continue at the Centre for Sport of Independence (South Mexico) and, finally, at the Morelos (North Mexico) Sports Centre.
He explained that the purpose of the study was to understand the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify the risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, World Diabetes Day will be observed, with the main objective of bringing together 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14, with the permission of their parents and under their care, to fill out individual nutritional questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or renal deficiency.
He explained that, on Saturday, anthropometric measurements would be made of all participants (weight, growth and coverage of waist), measurement of blood pressure and glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to identify genes related to child obesity).
Cruz Lopez said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in child weight.
Medical studies carried out between 1999 and 2006 indicate that there has been an increase in only six years: 77 per cent of boys were obesity in the case of girls, 47 per cent; there was also a significant increase in weight, "said MSSI.
He said that the validity of the search for markers was based on the fact that the population of the country was different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, the Mexican was 65 per cent American, 30 per cent European and 5 per cent African, and that the condition had an impact on the genes that were related to diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the main consequence of obesity genetics was the inability of the body to burn the excess energy we consume (calories), and it was delayed as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants was a comprehensive assessment of children, which could determine whether they had any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark depots on the neck (acans) and forearm means that metabolism and even pre-diabetes are likely to break.
Information is provided with all confidentiality, and the doctors transmit it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and changes in the way of life that must be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there were three main reasons for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sitting lifestyle, or a lack of daily physical activity, the holding of most of the day before the television, and the use of small-distance transport rather than walking.
It is also due to the high consumption of calories, that is, the increase in the use of sweet beverages and carbohydrates (Tamale, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high fat and protein content and the genetic predisposition analysed in this programme.
The UNAM asphalt can avoid cracks.
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Department, developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of best quality, resistant to environmental and temperature effects.
If attention were to be given to the signals sent by road cover, it would be necessary to repair some 200,000 miles per rainy season in the capital area of the Mexico Valley, as described by Rafael Herrera Naher, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Department, and add that if the construction and maintenance of the asphalt road surface were correct, the number could be reduced or reduced to zero at all.
In his lecture, the technological view of the International Year of Chemistry pits indicates that the laboratory for which it is responsible is developing a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of characteristics close to bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Errera Naher said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather was extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and thus to prevent education.
He explained that the bitum, the largest part of the oil, was the sequence of the hydrocarbon molecules, some of the high molecular mass called asphalt, and others of the low molecular mass called Maltenes, which together gave the road cover its characteristic viscous behaviour.
The intuitive behaviour of the bitumen is that at a high heat rate of about 180 degrees, it acts as a liquid, at 120 of its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it remains almost solid, while at very low temperatures it becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance of street asphalt is not constant, but changes during the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, as stated by the chemical engineering expert.
A scientist from the chimfak observed that the streets of Mexico City were mostly covered by flexible coatings, which were made up of six layers of material, of which the last three included bitumen.
Among the upper layers is a bitumen made of small stones, dropped into a bitumen and then compressed.
Every stone that makes up this surface, he said, is submerged into a bitum.
When vehicles are moved and forces are applied, it helps the forces to be very well-distributed on the road.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt coated, he added, the last layer, which is called a layer of wear, which is made of a small stone, actually sand also immersed in asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will be in contact with transport wheels, it must have more resistance than asphalt coating and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and disseminate these efforts, the wear layer also requires appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
The weather, especially the humidity and temperature changes, were also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it had a significant impact on the state of the asphalt.
When the earth is raw, the water penetrates the surface and it is difficult to get out of it, it causes all layers of the surface to be softened and thus education to be developed.
In education, he said, the first layer of wear was worn and only then it affected the bitumen, but the damage did not occur immediately, a process that should be addressed in the first signs of ongoing maintenance programmes.
A member of the National Research System also explained that the transport load was another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each surface should always be related to the transport load and that this requirement should be guaranteed in order to prevent frequent occurrence.
Rafael Herrera said that there was still a lot of work to be done on the bitumen, for example, on the bitumen emulsions that were already on the market in other countries and even helped to fix the holes with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What did the candidate for Valle not have to become the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Cerna Melina Ramírez from getting Miss Colombia's crown.
The representative of Valle won the title of princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca was left only to seek the crown of Miss Columbia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Cerna was to be satisfied that he was at the podium of the winners with the silver crown and the ribbon proclaiming her the new princess of Colombia.
In the light of the result of last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and the skipper, the department has 14 titles, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who were close to the crown, but were declared to be princesses, including Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingez (1949), Patricia Belini Ayala (1979), Lauren Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsata (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Grison (1987), Grison (1987).
The question that many now ask is:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, which in each of the statements showed that she had everything to become a new Miss Colombia, not just that she was elected by the Queen of the Police and the most beautiful person in the Vogue version, the titles that the Queen had held, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who had received the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the title of the First Princess was that she was unable to answer the question, "What book is it that characterizes you and why?
She said to the person who asked:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of inculcation, and I definitely think that the book that characterizes my childhood," Little Prince, "is a very deep book.
Today I read "Crime and Punishment," a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; also at this point, I am reading the book of Irina Nemirovsky, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called "Blood Heat."
The answer that the jury did not like because of the term "inculcating" and, secondly, because it did not specifically explain how each of the quoted books described it.
But after the Melina ceremony, she said that she was calm and happy with her result: "The universe of wisdom is happening what should happen."
And you all, please read a little, "Little Prince" is a great book. "
In the words of the hypothesis, Valle was burned from favouritism.
A reporter from Bogotá suggested that, because she was preferred, she was met with ovaries, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (the Oster cooking contest, the best national-suit visual vote, and the Queen-Mother), "which triggered the jealousy of other women, caused stress from the Queen, and as a result she did not appear on the stage."
And that was noted during her first appearance in the bathing suit on Hilton's beach and for two of her evening coronation shows.
While she looked confident in both, it was evident that she lacked the power and energy that the Magdalena and Atlantic representatives had shown.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at the "As at Home" program on RCN, said that the fact that Milena was called a princess "means that a candidate who won more awards during the competition does not become a queen."
In addition, the representative of Valle has recently been avoiding the press, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That's why two days before the choice, a member of the international jury Lucy Doti said that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of their country.
"The beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we must look not only at the appearance, but also focus on the public consciousness before they take part in the competition, they should be involved in the projects," she said.
It is also suggested that the representative of Valle has sinned with defects on her buttocks and fibrosis, which was seen on her abdomen, but this is controversial, as the jury has highlighted her as a candidate with "natural beauty," taking into account her healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queen Jorge Hernan Orosko's consultant notes that Melina had not the best body, which was better, "but the problems of fibrosis on her stomach, which was not very visible to me, made her lose her glasses on the last day."
On the other hand, a journalist, Guido Oyos, from Cromos magazine, believes that the mistake of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she had been subjected to surgical intervention.
"The operations are good, but the representative of Valle doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize, which was first presented by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, the brutal prophecy came true last night, they say it was an uncle who Raimundo gave to Melin as compensation for being deprived of the pleasure of getting the crown.
Whether or not this is the fact that Melina is beginning today a year of government, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at an international competition that is directly indicated by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will enter history as one of the Queen, who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena competition, has faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
That was the work of a man who identified Alfonso Cano's body.
The CSI from Cali has entered history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, the CSI CSI Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the head of the FARC, Alfonso Cano, to compare his fingerprints.
Of the seven forensic experts working for CTI, it is time this week to "dejure" Elisabeth González, a man from Puerto Texas who spent 21 years in the area of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in Choco, where he often had to go through the jungle for more than five days to reach the place where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and after completing his courses, he became a forensic expert, who studied skin friction, that is, palm and chair.
In the week of the Elisabeth operation on the identification of a person known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take his clothes for no more than three days.
Something great was coming.
On Friday night, he arrived on a helicopter from Cauca to Palmir.
He knew he would have to identify two bodies, one of which was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten pictures of Guillermo León Saens' prints (his real name).
However, when he arrived with a study group at the place where the body was located, he did not identify him on the outside; he was very different from the one shown in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a local farmer, no glasses, and a lot of weight.
But the prints don't lie.
Using the magnifying glass, ink, shovel and flashlight, Elisar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the photos.
His eyes were not let down: it was Alfonso Cano.
The same night, the representative of Puerto Texas was asked to confirm to Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinson that it was the head of the FARC.
Searching fingerprints
The recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos, Elisar González, at a press conference on the operation against Kano, is particularly significant for the Sijin of Cali.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactiloscopy is a strict science, without mistakes, it can play a key role in the detection of crimes.
In addition to the identification of the bodies, the specialists of the Dzyloscopy are involved in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder and identify the detainees.
Many criminals have forged or undocumented documents when they are arrested.
We're taking their prints and looking for them in the database.
The researcher said that if he was stolen, he had to take a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the thief had his hands on the safe full of jewels and money.
"It's hard to work with the walls because they're not easy surfaces to take off, but in that case, we can take a picture of the whole palm and identify the perpetrator who took part in a few robberies," he says.
The prints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man with liquor bottles around him was recently found.
In the course of the investigation, it was found that a relative could have been suspected of having committed a crime and that the fingerprints on the bottle had, in fact, coincided.
Although it doesn't guarantee that he was a killer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
The CTI medical examiner explained that a chemical or physical reagent is being applied to the location where the prints are available.
When they appear, a shovel or tape shall be used to remove them.
The prints are then sent to Asif, which is a criminal database, or are entered on the register.
"The problem is that we still have many undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything was as shown on the CSI television programme.
Just like not all the gold that's bluffing, not all you touch is keeping your prints on.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
The "angry people" challenge the authorities of New York.
Hundreds of protesters broke up a camp in front of Zukkotti Square.
Some of the protesters heard the court's decision to take the demonstration out of the square and went to the park next door.
The members of the Store Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried to reenter Manhattan Square under a court order, from where they were evacuated at dawn while attempting to capture another Greater Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters dug up at Zukotti Square, where they wanted to go through a court order that allowed "angry people" to break up a camp in the square while another part of the movement responded to the excavation, seizing a park in the north of the city where further arrests were made.
"Our idea is that, since the court does not allow us to set up a camp in a square, we will break up a camp somewhere else and continue to fight for a return to Zukotti and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations," said one of the representatives of the capture Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of "angry people" to the evacuation of a tent town, which was ordered personally by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, had been brought to court, where Judge Lucy Billings had issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the area and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, "angry people" began to take over a new park located at the junction of the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the Church of Trinity.
At least an hour, they could have taken this place, but then the police came and started arresting some of the protesters, although Brey could not give the exact number, but he told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The Organization is confident that several hundred people were standing with tents at the place where a delegation of religious leaders went to show support for the members of the movement in an attempt to mediate negotiations with the police.
However, the area of Zukotti, which is a private property, remains closed pending the trial scheduled for this Tuesday, which will consider the legality of this morning & apos; s outburst of protesters.
Some of the protesters who were going there carried and distributed copies of that court order and even provided them to the police officers who were guarding the area, which led to "some small clashes," said Bray, who said that some police officers had beaten the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating the members of the Zackity Wall Street movement and enforcing "laws that were issued after the seizure began, or from preventing demonstrators from returning to the park with shops and other property used earlier."
The Mayor of Bloomberg told the reporters that, as a result of this court order, the city had suspended the opening of public space and the demonstrators had been informed of it, but local laws did not allow them to redeploy tent shops and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zukotti Square at dawn, an operation in which some 200 arrests were made, and the decision was made because the protesters "violated the law."
Bloomberg said that he had ordered the area to be cleared, as it had become "a place where people did not come to protest, but rather to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others" because "some enterprises were threatened" and neighbours were afraid "of a deterioration in the quality of life."
The evacuation that took place this morning was disgusting and shows that, deep down, Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers, added a representative of the movement who condemns the mayor for "contempt of freedom of expression."
Those responsible for the occupation of Wall Street also indicated that they intended to organize "grand acts" on Thursday, in collaboration with social organizations and trade unions, in order to recall the last two months of the protests that had begun on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show.
Together with Michael Buble and other outstanding Canadians, she will be on the "Russell Peters Christmas" television programme on December 1.
Canada Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in "Big Repair," a lifeguard at "Malibu Squad," Bunny in "Playboy," and now an actress and model will be Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the pilot (ballad), Michael Bublé and other outstanding Canadians, will be on the "Russell Peters Christmas" television programme on December 1, as a very special Mary.
The CTV presented today a television show in which Anderson, also known on a widely available Internet home-based pornographic video where she appears with her then husband, the drummer of the "Mötley Crüe" group, Tommy Lee, appears to be dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll in the gutter that depicts Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently took the lead in the "My Hard Torpedo of Truth" tour, Charlie Shin, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special Christmas show of CTV is attended by a Canadian singer, Bublé, who, at the end of March, married in Buenos Aires to an Argentine model, Luisiana Lopilato, and who also knows how to fight.
Bublé recently called "bitch" to an American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan reborn after the earthquake
GDP increased by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and brought an end to the fall that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that has led to a nuclear crisis, a terrible disaster carried by the rising sun country since World War II.
According to the first estimates of the Tokyo Government, the material losses were $300,000 million, a strike that, despite the difficult world situation, seems to be taking place.
After three consecutive losses, gross domestic product data from July to September clearly helped to turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent from the previous quarter and by 6 per cent annually.
In the second quarter, the Japanese fiscal year begins in March 2012, and also represents the fastest growth from January to March 2010.
The rebirth may be due in part to the resumption of the purchase of machine equipment for the rehabilitation of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against a 0.9 per cent reduction in capital costs from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true break in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian momentum, which calls for the use of the crisis to strengthen - or restructure - infrastructure by using the gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, mainly because of the development of household consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This rate has increased by 1 per cent as a result of increased costs for cars, travel and rest.
Clemo yen
Tokyo provided the domestic market when the Yena, the Japanese currency, became one of the "currency-havens" chosen by investors who wanted to deal with the euro-zone debt crisis and negative projections about the US, a privilege that was pushing the stone into the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technological companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for their low performance from July to September.
As long as markets continue to siege EU peripheral countries, the Government of Eshihiko Noda does not reduce vigilance.
We must be careful about the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the sharp increase in the value of the yen, said by Minister of Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most of the participating countries showed clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator that predicts the global economy's fractures has shown that the main forces are slowing down.
It then fell by four tenth to 100.4 points, from 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average of 100 points after falling to eight tenth to 99.13 points.
Athens again gives rise to doubt.
Papadimos said that the adjustment would be approved, but the conservatives would not sign any written obligation.
With the peripheral risk and uncertainty awards in the parks, Greece continues to wander through the labyrinth that is leading to a major European debt crisis.
The sense that the "consent" of the new transitional Government of Ellada is imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by the true conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment might not be sufficient to apply them, the leader of the New Democracy conservative party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections on 19 February.
The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions taken at the 26 October summit, said Papadimos yesterday, opening up the parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow in a vote of confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase the employment of the population, reform of the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, the message from Samaras does not clarify any doubt about his position: "We are ready to assist the Transitional Government, but we do not promise anything."
The conservative leader had taken one step more in his mood about the EU and IMF, the organizations that should unfreeze the 8,000 million urgently needed by the Athens, and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter of acceptance of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still frustrated by the effect of the adoption of the Papandreu referendum in the style of everything or nothing, reiterated yesterday that its demands were clear: it would not resume assistance unless the new Government and the leaders of the major Greek parties signed "a written agreement without ambiguity and as soon as possible."
A representative of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafai, said that the three inspectors could "very soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new Government "what should be done to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although the exact date had not yet been set.
There's enough thread in the Greek tuber for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope."
The Queen emphasized Spain's "main" position with regard to this type of finance.
Spain has "taken a prominent place in the world in the area of microfinance."
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that, over the past two decades, the country has become the second largest donor to the instruments of cooperation, whose "essence" she said, is that it is "an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind based on faith in people."
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valyadolid, with the conviction that "there is no doubt" such action is "essential" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and "especially with a view to reducing by half the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is set."
Spain "is still working" to expand the network of recipients around the world and is taking on this task with all "responsibility," said Donya Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will last until Thursday, will "create new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women," the main recipients of these loans. "
There are "many achievements" and "many challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform that promotes "two main objectives."
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and that one hundred million of those households would emerge from the poverty to which they were plunged.
The momentum for the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world "was on the road, which began years ago," Muhammad Yunus, "emphasized Ms. Sofia as" an act of justice and recognition. "
And she described the father of this instrument as "an amazing idealist in the global fight against poverty," whose work has been known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study his lending policy.
This experience was carried over a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "everywhere I saw continuous development," Her Majesty, whose connection to the project gave her the title of "head of the family," gathered at Valyadolid by the "banker of the poor."
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded by calling on those present to participate and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative."
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity was a "ethical imperative" for every democratic State.
In that regard, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, as it was a "permanent commitment."
Jiménez concluded that microcredit called for "a serious and firm course of action to eradicate poverty," and now "more than ever" developed country Governments must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and prevent it from becoming a victim of cost-cutting.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main areas of cooperation for development."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, commended the "success" in giving "confidence" to people "with all the doors closed," and the Mayor of Valladolida, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed all those present in the city who "open their doors to a spirit of solidarity."
HDZ proposes to elect the Chairman of the European Commission by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (HDZ), on Monday, 14 November, was held in Leipzig without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the President of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it was in the fall itself, in particular, to satisfy activists who believe that government policy is far from being as strict as it should be today with regard to Greece and perhaps tomorrow with respect to Italy...
The draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, which had been submitted by the management, had been adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The maintenance of the standing for a few minutes, which deserved to be heard by Angel Merkel and a few hours later, Wolfgang Shayblé, Eurofil and the Minister of Finance, did not leave room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and of the draft resolution is the slogan: the correct response to the crisis is "not less than Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "it's time for a breakthrough in Europe."
This may mean changes in the Treaty of Lisbon that make it possible to strengthen the European Union's control over the financial policies of the countries of the eurozone, but it may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a universal vote "to give Europe a face."
In any event, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by Congress, which is clearly the idea of Wolfgang Shyblé.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree to this decision; Britain is opposed to this, and HDZ leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also opposed to it.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, the overwhelming majority of delegates rejected the proposal to weigh the voice of each EU member country on the European Central Bank's board according to the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
In an effort to calm the situation in his party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kol, but it did not seek to influence Congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in a difficult situation that like to criticize "arrogant" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devoted a whole paragraph to the importance of "German-French friendship," Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just a mimosas.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeat of the Napoleon army.
What is fraud with hospital sheets?
Following the cash benefits, UMP and the government started an attack on hospital sheets.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will come to Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefit Fund and to make a speech on this issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on combating social benefits fraud.
And in order to help this offensive, which has emerged from the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also as part of the right-wing campaign to re-elect the President, most want to focus on hospital sheets.
In the first place, in view of budgetary savings, the Government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on private employees before the payment of the benefit.
It is clear that without the special consent of the employer, the sick employee will lose a salary of at least 15 per cent of his / her monthly income in four days.
A measure that threatens to create a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
This will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, to impose one day on public servants without a sickness benefit (public employees have not yet had to wait for the payment of the benefit, as opposed to three days & apos; waiting for private sector employees).
At a time when these issues are being discussed, most also raise the issue of fraud again, with a view to the abuse of hospital records.
Control will become stronger and in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all the payments you have illegally received, "warned Xavier Bertrand on the RTL channel on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the application was somewhat disproportionate to the real abuse of hospital sheets.
They have indeed been under constant control and political attacks since 2002, which have borne fruit.
People in France are no more sick than they are in Europe.
Let's look at the country numbers first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than Euro237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, the daily compensation cost of Euro11.3 million in 2008 was 5 per cent of total health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were for maternity leave and industrial accidents and 54 per cent for sickness benefits, which amounted to Euro6.2 million.
And therefore, it was 2.5 per cent of the health-related costs.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in hospital in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
The arithmetic average, which concealed some of the differences; another study published in 2007 by the Monster.com Career Management website, showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any day of hospital.
Another study on health insurance this time states that in 2010, 37 per cent of hospitals lasted less than 8 days, 15 per cent from 15 days to one month, 15 per cent from 1 to 3 months and 11 per cent longer.
By comparing these figures with those of European neighbours, it is clear that French workers are no longer more likely to take hospital care than any other country.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total share of absenteeism in France (for health reasons or not) varied between 10 and 11 per cent, compared with 20-28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16-18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital sheets is very low compared to "grey" employment.
As for the level of fraud, it is very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has led to a systematic review of hospital hours of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term reports were "unjustified" or too long, "which is 37,050.
In the case of a systematic check-up of more than 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were "inappropriate or unfounded," which is 132,000.
In general, 169,000 cases are found to have been "unfounded" for several million workers who have received hospital lists.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, for example, "grey" employment.
According to a member of the UMP, Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, they amount to between 9,000 and 15,000 million euros of underincome per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation and is therefore infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Papadimos: Greece should follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos announced this in Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his coalition Government were not sufficient to carry out that task.
"In order to achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," the head of Government said, "who made his first public statement, opening a debate on a vote of confidence in the Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October should be the "main task" of the new Government, since "the country's presence in the eurozone" was at stake, "he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos is projected to reduce the country's budget deficit "to about 9 per cent" of GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The right-wing people reject the measures of the new Government.
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said in a meeting with his party's deputies, New Democracy.
He expressed his agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but also his rejection of any course that prevented economic recovery.
Ollie Renu, the European Commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary credit of 8,000 million euros without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and suicide with external assistance, as stated by the committee of experts
Canals are denied death, confirmed in a report by the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee argues that the Government, health-care institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, not including cancer.
Canals are being denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the Criminal Code so as to allow for the use of foreign assistance and euthanasia in cases where this choice is imposed by circumstances and a patient may be considered competent to make such a decision.
For the first time, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is at number 10, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death."
Although medical treatment is not available, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, experts appointed by the Royal Canadian Society report.
And 68.6% of them end up dead in the hospital.
The country & apos; s highest rate is in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicides with external assistance, the report concludes that it is contrary to the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it is not willing to change anything in the Criminal Code with regard to euthanasia and suicide with external assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization is an abuse of use, that is, euthanasia or suicide with external assistance against people who are unable or unwilling to take such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, who submitted the report, confirmed the majority of such cases in countries where euthanasia and foreign suicide had not been legalized.
Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Suicide with help is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for euthanasia
It should be borne in mind that 85 per cent of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia because, according to a 2010 survey of Angus Reid, they believe that this will enable people to alleviate their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that legalization of euthanasia will not be a signal that the lives of older persons or persons with disabilities are of less value.
In the case of persons who assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of those interviewed believed that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the sick, the situation was less clear, as the report said.
They also propose, among other recommendations, that the Penal Code should establish that a legal termination of medical care is not an offence.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained to respect end-of-life health care without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls on the Government, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminal sedations already widely applied in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to extinguish physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some experts in health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Mr. Pierre Deschan, a health law expert, described as "extreme" the position of the experts who signed the report, since, among other things, it did not limit the use of euthanasia to death.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is more than 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide is said by Mr. Deshan, who discussed the report's summary yesterday.
Mr. Desham also stressed that the report seemed to place the independence of the individual above all other values that constituted the social fabric of society.
He said that "there are signs and prohibitions in society."
The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also "categorically disagrees with the conclusions of the report, which she called" a manifesto for euthanasia. "
Margaret Somerville, who himself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, challenges, inter alia, the report & apos; s data on abuse in some countries where euthanasia and foreign suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to give up power
Damascus condemns "conspiracy."
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar Assad's supporters demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure increased on Syria, Bashar Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resisted him and condemned the "conspiracy" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria & apos; s membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, while the Syrian neighbours Turkey and Jordan supported the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar Assad to give up power in Syria, where some 40 other civilians and members of the regime & apos; s armed forces were killed.
"If the interests of his country were to be of concern to Bashar, he would have to resign, but he would also have created the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, as the King of Jordan, a neighbour of Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
In turn, the Foreign Minister of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoğlu, expressed regret that the mediation efforts of Turkey, which began earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who did not live in peace with their people and could not meet their aspirations would lose power, he said, pointing to Syria, a neighbouring country towards which Turkey was increasingly taking a hard course.
For its part, the United States welcomes "the expansion of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime," following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly stringent course towards repression in Syria, as noted by Mark Thoner, a representative of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime & apos; s armed forces died in the Dar & apos; a area of southern Syria, reporting to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed during an exchange of fire and heavy machine-gun fire in Jobar in the besieged city of Homs, according to this ONG.
During a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid Muallem, stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis. "
In addition, he responded strongly to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which he said was a "dangerous step."
Syria will not be broken, but he added, making sure that this plot against Syria will fail. "
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying "a mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires the intoxication of 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe also called for the dispatch of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said had been "paranoia."
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for a solution to the crisis adopted on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities where the fighting is taking place and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, called the decision of the League of Arab States "wrong" yesterday, while China called on Syria to implement the plan to overcome the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time from the markets and the Italian victims.
The future head of Italian government, Mario Monty, has asked for some time from the markets to form a team and implement a programme that will require "victims" to restore the credit that has been lost in the last few months of the Berlusconi rule.
The former European Commissioner participated in discussions with political parties yesterday before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet made up of technocrats that are not part of Parliament.
Monty spoke about the importance of a many-victim programme, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the discussions following a meeting with the Prime Minister candidate.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Janfranco Fini, said that he would wait to see if Mario Monty would ask Parliament to vote on trust before Friday to make sure that the new government had sufficient support.
The meeting will end with the submission by Mr. Monti of a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of country, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday's insufficiency of stock exchanges and bond holders, asking for time.
In "democracy, time is needed to prepare the Government and the programme, he stressed, adding that he is convinced that markets will be patient and understand."
His appointment by the President was initially approved by the markets, but concerns were raised again, in particular after the sudden fall in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister was to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include "politicians."
The new Government would have to be in force until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will receive a vote of confidence from Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important actor in Europe.
The representative of the European Commissioner, Ollie Ren, stressed that "despite the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed."
The European Union, which was convinced that Rome would not implement the 2013 budget, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, had required, inter alia, new and strict measures.
The Italian "boss" Emma Marcegalla, who will meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to relaunch the economy "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the parameters of the deficit."
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), presented the "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism," "Professor," symbolizing "challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy," according to the authors of the front.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid an early election, since by April 2012, Italy was required to make payments of Euro200,000 million for public debt.
A Russian scientist assisted the Iranian nuclear programme
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danienko was helping Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-fit detonator and confirmed on Monday the United States nuclear-risk agency.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of that United Nations agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the "possible military aspect" of the Iranian nuclear programme
According to ISIS, largely based on IAEA documents, Mr. Danienko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years "since the 1960s, at the Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds with explosive methods."
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to set up a company that produced "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The financial difficulties of his company led him to contact with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, until he returned to Russia.
In its report, IAEA referred to "clear signs that Iran's development of the" nuclear detonator system "was facilitated by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the equipment well, but also informed the Agency that he had worked most of his career on the technology within the framework of his home country's military nuclear programme."
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence decreased or did not change.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 per cent, compared with an increase of 13 per cent in cases of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4 per cent in attacks against Jews and an overall increase of 14 per cent in the number of religious crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, has increased very little to 6,628, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
Following a decline in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of these crimes is increasing again, emphasizing Human Rights First, "the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant," added to the organization in an official communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered serious human rights violations," added one of the leaders of Paul Lejandr.
"The American Government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, adding, believing that this could be done by improving police reporting on hate crimes."
"Hate crimes" in federal law are the legacy of a period of struggle for civil rights.
This law was adopted following the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook.
On Monday, the Twitter microblogger website changed the presentation of its platform, which would enable its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they were watching, making this service look like Facebook.
The new "activity" and other "name" are able to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other "tweets," Internet users whose messages ("tweets") you track, and those who track yours.
This provides an opportunity to learn if they publish messages, if they sign up for new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "at a small percentage of users in August" before being widely available on Monday, and announced to the AFP a Twitter press secretary, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which has long been known as intuitively rather incomprehensible, and as using rather unclear terms (RT to outpost someone else's collection, # follow-up to recommend tracking other users), is a way of giving the pleasure to experienced users, and is thus open up to a wider audience, providing users with something closer to the popular social networks Facebook and Google +.
On the network, users discussed this innovation with tweets on the Internet.
"It's useless, obsessive and too much like Facebook."
Functional activity will help me better monitor certain elements of my Twitter flow, wrote @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
The introduction of the "gold rule" budget into the Constitution
The leadership of the large coalition of social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to record the budget "gold rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible reduction of the Austrian State credit rating agencies (triple A).
The Chancellor of Social Democrat, Werner Faymann, personally announced this decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with an Austrian public debt of 74.6 per cent, much higher than the upper threshold of 60 per cent set by the Maastricht Treaty but below the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria & apos; s capacity to pay had fallen by only one point, from AAA to AA +, we would have paid interest by 3,000 million euros more each year, and the Vice-Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs from Christian Democrats, Michael Schpindellegger, gave an argument.
Thus, Austria is meeting the demand of the Eurozone Summit on 26 October in Brussels; the Heads of State and Government have called for a reduction of budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The Austrian Government's decision resembles the "German model," since Germany was the first European country to adopt this "rule."
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the State budget of the federal State should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP in any year, and land, like the communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to force public debt to fall below the 60 per cent set out in the Maastricht Treaty by 2020 / 2021.
Eshihiko Noda
threatening new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japan's Prime Minister, Eshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would conduct new currency market interventions if the value of the yen continued to increase.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we consider that the yen exchange rate is too volatile, Mr. Noda Senate has explained.
On Tuesday, the yen grew almost to a historic mark, which led the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which established a new record of power since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown steadily, driven by the purchase of investors who see it as a "safe haven" in these troubled times of economic decline around the world and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the level that caused the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth about 120 yen, and the euro was over 160 yen.
The growth of Japanese currency is detrimental to Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese firms from abroad when converted into national currency.
"Japan is fighting to rebuild itself" after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), stressed Mr. Noda, who fears that this increase in yen will kill the fragile fetus of recovery.
The third largest economic Power in the world resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in the year, owing to increased exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yen does not reflect Japan's "fundamental economic performance."
The finance minister, Jun Azumi, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy manager of Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken "appropriate steps," making it clear that no further mitigation on Wednesday should be expected.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the issuing organization increased by 5,000 million yen (47,000 euros) the purchase of treasury bonds to 55,000 million yen (519,000 euros) the ceiling of the amounts it has allocated to the purchase of various financial instruments to support the securities market.
Eurozone
The stakes are growing, the stock exchanges are fluctuating.
The risk of exposure to the debt crisis is being undermined by European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and the improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in fragile countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, the European exchanges left this Tuesday, 15 November, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris at 10: 00 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4% and finished trading at 3,064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
In view of the new difficulties in paying credit to difficult eurozone countries, stock markets around the world continue to lose part of their recent achievements.
"Concerned investors are just too worried about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker of the IG Markets, quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo Exchange was closed with a 0.7% fall under the weight of new market concerns about Europe & apos; s ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has increased its view of Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in a corridor of narrow changes until investors have confirmed that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, a fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return of concern about the future of the eurozone is a single currency that continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lowest point in one and a half months.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, falling by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it fell following the departure of Chancellor Angela Merkel HDZ on Monday, at which a resolution was adopted, providing, inter alia, for a country in a difficult situation to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are significantly higher than 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
This morning, Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85 per cent, and Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2 per cent.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of the participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monty, asked for time from the exchange to restore the situation in Italy, which is under threat of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his Government.
Spain was under fire from markets before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The balance between interest rates on 10-year debt obligations between Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
In anticipation of growth figures in the eurozone
France recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent, as a result of increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised to a downward extent the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first assessment for the whole eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be decided after short discussion or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy trend that electoral meetings are becoming an occasion for reflection on the share and place of nuclear energy.
The dispute will not be fruitful until all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
France must base its views on objective facts and on sound data.
Now we are 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic development will double the need for electricity by 2050, unless a large part of the world & apos; s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing lack of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalances, a topic that has disappeared from environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision conditional on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy or of Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, South Africa, Sweden, China, India, Brazil are only a few who are firmly continuing their projects.
The United States decided to add one installation to its set after Fukushima by resuming the construction of the station, which was interrupted after the accident on Tri-Mile Island.
While the German renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, reality is contrary to this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, compounded by the increased demand for imported gas, in particular from Russia, the increase in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be tangible.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
The European turbine Champion, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is also the largest user of coal and gas due to the interrupted wind, resulting in carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices being 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher, respectively, than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy, energy prices are a key factor in competitiveness and the maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear power will result in a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will make the country & apos; s new industrialization and the protection of purchasing power illusory and beautiful.
The price that most French refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country & apos; s energy policy has made it possible to create an industry in 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
It is highly export-oriented, attracting a range of international trade-specialized small and medium-sized enterprises and creating many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France had decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would have had to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose 6,000 million euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What kind of electrician would order an EPR designed to work for 60 years if its manufacturer was to be closed?
In order to address the energy equation, it should be recognized that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy production.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable-gas solutions by Areva shows that energy sources are mutually complementary.
For nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of safety is clearly a vital issue.
In France, we have a security body that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are full of the same security obsession.
The nuclear industry has experienced three major incidents for 50 years.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, a reactor device and an unforgivable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force, which caused tens of thousands of deaths.
The nuclear industry will learn from the accident, as it has learned from the previous two.
The result of this step and the cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German constructors, EPR, is a project to counter such phenomena.
As it is being considered by all energy professionals who want to build a reactor, stopping its construction in Flamanville will be an excellent gift to the Areva and EDF competitors, paving the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
The best combination of energy sources for our country must be found, and legally, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased manoeuvres to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or a good for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized by various parties - the overload of police, judicial and administrative services, subject to a number policy and the compatibility of that policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a "State of human rights."
Then there was administrative harassment of foreign students, which was included in the news, when the Minister of the Interior ("Liberación" of 23 May) stated that France "does not need foreign talent, stone and waiter."
But it is very rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is much agreement between the right and left on this issue.
On the right hand, Jacques Chirak, who stated in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people would not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers," and on the left, Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France "cannot accept the world's poor."
The difference is only at the level of generosity.
In 2005, both the left and the right felt fear of an invasion of the country by the Order of Polish Wiring.
Both sides see immigration as a burden on the French economy and on French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity that they will be able to show to immigrants.
In his programme, François Holland was limited to banalies, saying that "working together would solve our immigration problem."
This perception of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but it is cost-effective.
As we are reminded by the economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron in a recent book that compiled the latest data on immigration (Special People: How Migration has formed our world and will determine our future, May 2011, Princeton University, 352 seconds), there is a broad consensus among professionals on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that host immigrants.
Restrictions on immigration reduce growth and reduce employment.
The fear of the influence of immigrants is based on the perception that they can replace local workers, especially low-skilled workers, by causing a decline in wages.
But experience has shown that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than the local labour force is being replaced by work that lacks the local labour force.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not related to job offers.
Positive impact on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between local and immigrant workers has led to a positive impact on the salaries of local workers.
Giovanni Peri estimated that an increase of 1 per cent in the migration flow would result in an increase of 0.6-0.9 per cent in real long-term wages.
This is without regard to the fact that the diversity offered by immigrants contributes to new ideas and economic growth (among the United States Nobel Prize winners, a large proportion of naturalized immigrants and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo all were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make net returns to social security systems, on average providing 1 per cent of the total budgets of European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant, who arrived at the age of 30 years, will make an average of 150,000 euros of net revenue (income minus expenditure) in the State budget for his or her life.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his mandate, was going to "teeth" into the missing growth points.
The teeth mentioned, which were used to scare immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, and it remains to think about European democracy.
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but at the same time, it is fragile.
The European continent must remember that by inventing it in Athens more than 2,000 years ago, in the twentieth century, it experienced the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulaga, and Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonians in Greece.
Some felt that it would be sufficient for democracy to finally prevail over its enemies to organize a vote and make it as direct as possible.
From the time of Napoleon, "Small" is known to be from the surface of the mind.
The general vote, although a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even become a "tool of suppression," as once said by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vashro.
No, democracy requires many others - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but above all it is a political crisis and a democratic crisis.
In that regard, the palinodia of a true Greek referendum would have a double impact, demonstrating both the need for serious policy change and the unpleasant sense of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This is a duality that needs to be thought out to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now moved and, in the view of many, the Republican soldiers are now going the wrong way.
We will not win by demanding a series of national referendums, organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
The "map blanche" for an absolute European monarch or a jump with bound feet into the abyss of nationalism is a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream of the blade of the guillotine, but of the implementation - joint, clear and continuous - of choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is not known how many more will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis - the European crisis.
The whole of Europe is fully subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is completely humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of European sovereignty, but the whole of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and each of its nations is with it.
The administration of the European project must be brought back to people's sovereignty as a matter of urgency.
Because only by working together will Europeans be able to reduce the debt burden of everyone, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
A solution to the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be adopted without full democratic legitimacy without leading us to a disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delor, everyone now demands the European economic government.
Let's do this.
But to think of it without the stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has taken place is another madness and a new impasse.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
A revolution of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a united Europe at the economic level.
This can be done only through the creation of a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true national European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
The uncontrollable chip cards are spreading more and more.
The World Chip Card Exhibition is open on Tuesday at Vilpent, under Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end with 11% of the world & apos; s microprocessor sales (bank cards, SIM-card phones), exceeding 6,000 million units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important sector is the uncontrollable technology sector, which allows public transport or purchase to be paid, simply by carrying out a map of the readable device.
This year, 460 million uncontrollable chip cards will be sold in the world, up from 320 million years ago!
Their share will increase in 2012 (580 million units are expected) to be almost 10 per cent of the world & apos; s net map market (6,925 million maps).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of uncollectible payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards have already been provided with this function and are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting from a more modest point of view, with 400,000 uncontrollable Visa cards in circulation.
But the big stores are on the rise.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontrollable Pass MasterCard.
In order to move to a higher speed, banks need to provide equipment to their clients.
"Two major organizations in France have promised in the future to systematically distribute to their clients bank cards adapted for uncontrolled use," Gérard Nebui, Director-General of Visa Europe, France.
The banks are testing the payments with a mobile phone.
But this is only the first step in the development of a future means of payment, that is, a mobile phone.
So far, few equipment is equipped with the NFC (Distance Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they have to be really split next year."
"We are counting on the world's sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012," explained by Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced an experiment from December to June of next year in Kana.
The iPhone equipment will be provided by approximately 200 clients and staff members with uncollectible cheques.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that he was preparing a market offer that would allow his clients to pay through mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spreading from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that the Algerians were now certain of that.
"The method used by these two organizations and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating," he explained without going into detail.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
The investigation into the abduction of two French in the Niger in January revealed two links.
The persons abducted at a restaurant in Niamey, close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leukur and Vincent Delory, were apparently killed the following day, together with several of the kidnappers, during an operation carried out by French special units.
Among the debris that remained after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone sights belonging to the terrorists.
The axis of terror
An analysis of the calls had indicated several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maydighuri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to be close to Akmi and a cult.
"This is a step forward, but there is no doubt a need to wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Akmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for many years that the sect has received financial and ideas support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more active," said Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of death bombers and increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type as the Akmi.
The international community, led by Washington, is now putting pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the problems that Boko Haram is creating.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally seen this group as a community of enlightened people that is not of interest.
Rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maydighuri at the mosque, school and at the Imam fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "Western education is a sin" - presupposes the establishment of an Islamic emperor in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and requires strict compliance with the Shariah, and its activists have begun to fight against the unjust central government.
It is aimed mainly at churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram & apos; s activists were particularly active, committing numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radiated and will go beyond its northern votchins.
Last Christmas, she took responsibility for the action that killed 80 people in Jos, and then one in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram organized the first suicide attack on a strengthened police headquarters in Abuja.
In August, the United Nations field office will be their first international goal.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is coming from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a matter of concern to all security experts.
Today, as the Akmi have been strengthened in Mali and the Niger and the Al-Shabaab Somalis are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during an interview with Presidents Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppe, he warned Boko Haram of the danger and expressed his willingness to share all available information.
The world, as the Republican presidential candidates see it.
With regard to China, Iran and assistance to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry are competing in simplicity and incompetence.
Can America's weakened crisis lead a complex world with simple, more specifically, simplistic ideas?
If you heard the Republican presidential candidates, the voters could believe it.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying a loud but not detailed foreign policy statement, which is traditionally a strong part of the Republicans.
The slogans of China, Iran and Israel are often mixed.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of being nominated by the "Old Good Party," threatened to file a complaint against the Chinese with the WTO and to accuse them of "manipulating their currency," is a sensitive topic for America, which is irritated by the migration of entire industries into Asia.
The worst is if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Obama's Ambassador to China and the only candidate with a complex foreign policy, was unable to overcome a position that was haunting emotions.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is at the bottom of the ratings, has not been heard.
Reagan style
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if the sanctions could not stop his nuclear programme.
"If they choose me, I will stop Iran," he said. "
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel by accusing Obama of not fulfilling the promises made to that partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second in the candidates' rating, showed a disgraceful lack of knowledge of the cases.
He recently called for the Chinese military threat, because Beijing was trying to achieve nuclear power, apparently without knowing that China had already had it since 1964!
The Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, who supports Israel and is committed to military attacks on Iran, says he is ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Cain, Perry and the candidate Michel Bachman also recommend torture of terrorist suspects prohibited by Obama in 2009.
All of this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy foreign policy.
The current president's opponents say that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won a cold war.
They remind me that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to lower his tone with regard to the fight against terror.
They have rightly insisted on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of the "boys" from Iraq, on his tricks in Libya, which have given him a reputation for weak policies.
But the offensive is not that simple.
The population considers the national security balance of Obama to be positive, which has eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that are linked in the sand.
And, by saying that America needs to be rebuilt economically to restore its leadership, Obama is right.
North Flow, new gates for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The North stream, which connects Western Europe and Russia directly to the Baltic Sea floor, has been launched.
It is designed to supply a gas equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas manufacturer, wanted to celebrate this event with the pompus.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between the launch of the orchestra and the search for food, the opening of the North stream, a new gas pipeline that directly links Russia and Germany under the water.
The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fiyon and his Dutch colleague, Mart Rütte, together turned a symbolic valve to control the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline will provide 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas each year to Western Europe through the first 1,224 km long pipeline linking the Leningrad region to the land of Meklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline should be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to all French consumption.
The possibility of building a third pipeline on the same direction is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met with a violent resistance from Poland and the Baltic States.
The Northern Flow will indeed allow the transport of gas directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose part of their power: they will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to deny access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop before comparing the North Polt with the new "German-Soviet Pact," pointing to an alliance between Hitler and Stalin with the aim of occupying Poland in 1939.
It means that the question is politically sensitive.
In support of this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking more security of its supply.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has achieved its understanding of a direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are already at an end.
"This gas pipeline, part of cooperation with Russia, is a new artery that organically connects us," said François Fiyon, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
This explains the wide smile on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Ljumin, the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical development.
The submarine is made of steel wrapped in concrete to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It's at the bottom of the sea, at a mean depth of 200 meters.
In order to build it, it was necessary to circumvent the minefields that had been left of the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, the press secretary of the North Potok company.
Many steps were also needed to protect fauna and flora.
The pipe is a long metal snake of a weight of 242 Eiffel towers, without rupture over its entire length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but project managers abandoned it because Sweden was not happy that a Russian State company would be on its shores forever.
"In the event of an accident, we will close the gas flow in less than a minute," Jens Müller claims.
So, in the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline will go into the air.
But it seems unlikely to be a design that has designed stitches designed to leak only once every 100,000 years.
The status of the gas pipeline will be monitored by a submarine robot that is pulling the ship for external observation, as well as by a transporter.
The cigar shall be injected into a 1-metre-diameter pipeline and pushed forward by a gas flow.
Upon arrival after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second, it shall provide accurate information on any metal deformation.
The gas pipeline was designed for 50 years without any need for repair.
The circulation of the gas is done only by its pressure.
It is 200 bar at the time of departure and 100 bar at the time of arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement the project.
The leader is Gazprom, who owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Netherlands Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have established a joint venture called the North Potok, which was charged with the construction and operation of a gas pipeline.
His headquarters is in Tsuga, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented the company for 20 years, with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transport.
"Gazprom will pay for the full volume, no matter how much gas is actually transported," Jens Müller states.
The construction of the gas pipeline was financed by 30 per cent of the shareholders and 70 per cent by bank loans.
The total cost of the work would be Euro7.4 million for two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investments will be about 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure they'll take their costs because Gazprom is taking all the risks.
The gas pipeline is coming out of the Baltic Sea in Ljumin on a sand bank planted by the softwood trees.
The valves are 4.5 metres high and form the gas output terminal.
The sensors shall measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before it is pushed into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
It will be 3 million per hour at full capacity and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskin's brand notebook
Moleskin, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will bring back the taste of the letter.
He's got a scent of adventures, hours behind a letter in light of a candle.
Moleskin's notebook is easy to learn from a rectangular black cover, from a rubber, from a yellow and white page, as if it had been yellow over time.
However, Moleskin's record book, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to sell design notes.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant to the company, took responsibility for launching a new product.
The notebook is inspired by old production techniques, a molecule, a laced cotton tissue, used, for example, to cover the bench.
It is alleged that this type of notebook is highly valued by writers and travellers.
"Moleskin brought into line the old and forgotten thing, which was a cult for adventurer artists until the twentieth century," said Maria Sebregondi, who had since become a brand manager at the Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25% to 12.7 million.
We have gone far from producing the first years when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskin has crossed Italy's borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish the profile of a typical buyer because the notebook equally attracts a businessman, a student and a free-trade person.
Moleskin's buyers are cosmopolitan, widely viewed and educated.
A small Italian company, which had only 12 employees at first, now has 100 and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks to Fnac bookstores, shops in the centres of small cities, and has been able to become widely known.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new need for a letter, despite the arrival of an e-mail," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskin; the brand recently organized an exhibition called "The Side Path," where architects and artists showed their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched a leopard cover on the occasion of a film festival in Locarno.
Using its success and its cultural aura, Moleskin has diversified its products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and Brenda includes all kinds of support.
The success that led to the jealousy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the SG Capital Europe investment fund, now Synintegra Capital, which incorporated a new page into Moleskin's history.
Why is the unemployment rate so high among disabled workers?
About 19 per cent of persons with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment of persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite the public charity policy initiated in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, namely 19 per cent compared to 9 per cent for the general population.
Disgusting?
"No," he emphasizes Eric Blanche, Director General of Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for persons with disabilities. "
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not 2, but 3 times higher."
"However, much work remains to be done."
It must be said that there are still many obstacles to employment for a disabled person.
Of these, 37 per cent are older than 50 years of age (17 per cent on average).
Rather, they have a low level of qualifications: 80 per cent do not have a bachelor & apos; s degree, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very high, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, compared with 38 per cent on average.
In short, these are criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and that are at the core of the problem, "according to Christian Grap, Director General of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire a disabled worker.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about a mentality that is changing, but too slow.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre, commissioned by Cité, found that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge of disability and "represented all-round people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally disabled."
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of 6 per cent of workers with disabilities set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
"Today we are about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting tax from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of "taxable" organizations, like the amounts paid, decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 in 2007-2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which raised the tax, created strong pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blanc. "
"But this improvement also reflects an increase in awareness, in particular in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers, compared with 82 per cent of organizations with 100 to 199 employees.
Azar: "What a happiness."
Before fighting Sinimi on the evening of Tuesday (20.45), Eden Azar and Georges Lequens did not hide the pleasure they had received from this friendly match.
We're not going to say there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
While sitting next to the Wall of Stade de France, Georges Leeckens and Eden Azar made up.
Five months after the fall of his attacker in a match against Turkey, a Belgian coach can only praise him.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his promotion, and the fact that he's Belgian."
"I want to go on," Lille's player says.
As to the contrast between his achievements at the club and the team, it's one whole, he's justified.
"In Lille, I am a year-round, but not in Belgium."
"I have to make glasses."
Left in stock, in advance of this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to Saint-Denis to finally "come."
Without forgetting, however, the concept of "pleasure."
It has supported the Blue since the age of 7 and the poorer campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I have always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also increases the special nature of this match.
And especially that on the other side is Mathieu, and Johan, and Adil, he is mindful.
"Our roads just crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Lequens was kind enough to remember "pride."
"Pride" to play a "holiday game."
"Pride" is also to say as a "neighbour" that France "has again become a very high-level team" just a year after the Nisna injury.
"Laurent Blanc was like a thunder, he admired.
Now that Belgium is missing the next Euro, a technical athlete will fly on a single plane with a blue leadership... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will see it in future games, including this against France."
Portugal is very sure of itself.
Portugal, Paulo Bantu, is beginning its response against Bosnia (2 p.m.) on this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most important, a happy country."
Paulo Bent already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt to him that the Selective, which he has been driving since September 2010, is qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and Bosnia to win.
With 0-0 on Friday, it is clear in Zenica hell that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it has not been able to achieve an ambitious goal that would calm it down.
"This is a good result, which, however, carries a certain risk."
But at their brightly lit de la Luz stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass through, in front of a public who should be happy, even though the game will be very tense, "said the optimistic but intelligent Bent.
"We are waiting for a very hard match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance of being on Euro 2012," a successor to Carlos Keiroz.
No one in a match against Bosnia on Friday requires the Portuguese to win.
The Bosniacs could have set up no one.
"This is a good result, which, however, has some risk," I regret Bent.
"We will play against a team that has many technical qualities and has many individual virtues," he added.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, "not to give them time to think."
It's a good idea to be realistic this time.
