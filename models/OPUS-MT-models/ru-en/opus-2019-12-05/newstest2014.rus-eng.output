In Kinesm and the area, two men committed suicide.
In the past, one of the hangmen had already tried suicide.
On October 30, about 1-00, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he has tried suicide before.
What led a man to such a step is unknown.
On October 31, 11-50, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kinesma, died in his place of residence.
No signs of violent death have been found, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs's press service, "Kinemsky," reports.
The black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair a falling highway system, a lot of people are beginning to see a solution in a small black box that is carefully built on your car's dashboard.
These devices, which track every mile of traffic by a motorist and transmit this information to the officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to modernize an outdated system of motorway financing by the planning authorities of Washington and the state.
Normally, a boring motorway planning arena has unexpectedly created intense debate and colorful alliances.
Liberians have joined environmental groups in lobbying for the Government to use small boxes to track the number of miles you travel, and perhaps even where you travel, and then use this information in the compilation of tax accounts.
The tea party movement is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy.
Although Congress is not yet able to agree whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They are thinking about how, over the next decade, it is possible to move on to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they pass.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes for testing, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
"This is not a question on which we may have a choice," said Hassan Ihrat, the executive director of the Association of Southern California Governments, who is preparing plans to start monitoring by the state authorities the miles of each California car vehicle by 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
There's a technology for that.
This is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government & apos; s Roads Fund, financed by taxes paid by the United States on refuels.
Americans don't buy as much petrol as they used to.
The cars drive more than miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not been raised for 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise the tax by even one cent at high petrol prices.
"The gas tax is simply impossible to save," said Lee Mannich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices had recently been installed on vehicles to test the pay-for-money system.
"It would be the best alternative in the long term," he said.
The nuns call it a homemade user's fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The planning bodies in California are looking into the system in developing strategies to meet the targets set by the state & apos; s ambitious laws against global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives, Bill Schuester (Republican, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Chamber & apos; s Transport Committee, said that he also saw the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free market in the Reason Foundation is also thrilled to make drivers pay for every mile.
"It's not just a tax that will go into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, the Vice President of Political Affairs, Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former US Ministers of Transport, who called on Congress in 2011 to move towards a daily payment.
The United States Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, which would be attended by some 10,000 vehicles.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of the concerns of rural legislators representing voters, who often have to travel many miles to work or to the city in their daily lives.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The state of Oregon is the most enthusiastic in which 5,000 drivers are involved in the country & apos; s largest experiment.
These drivers are about to pay the state a mile away instead of a gas tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It is being considered in New York.
Illinois is testing it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 Eastern Coast States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is looking into how they can make these changes.
The concept was not universally accepted.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteer vehicles were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government was able to monitor each step.
"The concern about" big brother "and such things is a major problem," said Alawdin Khan, who is the head of strategy and performance management in the Department of Transport of the State of Nevada.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were under way, the United States Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website, "It will be easy to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices."
There is no need for an enormous, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states that is hard to find low-cost technology to enable the state authorities to keep track of the miles of the car, but without information about place and time.
If you can do this, said Han, society will feel more calm.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not assist in the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the developing market for a type of road insurance in which drivers were paid on the basis of mileage.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is periodically downloaded by a model.
"People will be more inclined to do so if you don't track their speed and location," said Ryan Morrison, the executive director of the True Mileage.
There were some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programmes.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with the provision of different options to drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can give up the device at all, instead, by deciding to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all the people of the state are passing.
In other places, we hope to sell the idea to the public at large, making the devices do more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a tax device that will also accept parking meter fees, provide "pay as you drive" insurance, and collect a real-time speed pool from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.
"Automotive users will be involved in the benefits offered to them," as stated in the urban design document.
Some transport system designers, however, are thinking about whether all the talk about a pay-off is just a huge distraction.
In the Gulf of San Francisco city transport commission, officials say that Congress could have been very easy to overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for the Construction of Roads by raising taxes on petrol.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on the drivers of hybrid vehicles and other persons whose vehicles do not use much petrol to pay their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you need to do is accept aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the director of the law and public relations commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private lives and a lot of other things.
The EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in the event of economic pressure from Russia.
The European Union has a stand-by plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan, if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of an association treaty between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
A stand-by loan is being negotiated with IMF, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their aim is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can obtain 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing differences on funding terms.
He does not believe in the possibility of the reforms necessary to obtain assistance, nor does the international rating agency S & P, which reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating by one step on Friday, to the "V" with "B."
However, EU representatives say that IMF can be flexible in terms of credit, taking into account Ukraine & apos; s circumstances.
In addition to the country & apos; s financial support plan, the EU has a stand-by option to provide Ukraine with gas, the bulk of which now comes from Russia.
It might be a gas from the North Flow or a river from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in case Russia "isolates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that such a method of reverse delivery to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and is likely to lead to a decline in supplies to other regions.
"Negotiations are under way between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favourable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources rather than from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," added the Reuters source.
Russia is not in the fight for urban pollution by motor vehicles
Efforts to address transport problems in major cities have been observed in most of the world's mega-cities since the second half of the twentieth century.
They were usually either rebuilt and expanded, or attempted to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of vehicles and the time they were used.
The case of Singapore is well known, with a strong quota of growth in private cars and the right to purchase them is purchased at auction.
Its price may be two or three times that of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entry into the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, where only vehicles with a certain eco-class are allowed to enter and also use high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a "five-year clean air plan" with a total value of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion) in 2012.
As stated by "I" by the Director of Transport Pollution Control of the Municipal Bureau for the Protection of the Environment of Beijing, Lee Kunsheng, the main objective of the five-year-old is to reduce leading air pollutants by 20-35 per cent by 2017, to increase the number of private cars to no more than 6 million (now 5.2 million) and to increase the use of fuel by no more than 5 per cent per vehicle.
According to the agency, road transport in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
The main measures of the programme are to limit the use of road transport as well as to impose additional taxes on road owners.
Among other things, the green five-year urban measures include the accelerated transition to European fuel standards, the introduction of local eco-standards and vehicle and fuel labelling, the restriction on the entry of vehicles into the central city, the prohibition of the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition to the establishment of incentive financial programmes for the replacement of old vehicles with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and service), and the development of public transport (including high-speed).
The vehicle innovation of Beijing also includes a ban on all private vehicles to move within the fifth transport ring (only in the capital city of China, six of them) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle registration plate), as well as the issuance of registration plates for motor vehicles on the basis of a lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of operation of the lottery, the total number of private car registration permits in Beijing was only one third of the number of 2010).
According to the current State programme "Environmental Protection 2012-2020," the number of cities with high and very high air pollution is to be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Environment, in 2011, "mobile sources" accounted for 41 per cent of all urban emissions.
In Moscow, for example, car emissions are ten times higher than industrial emissions and in St. Petersburg nine times more.
In the Russian Federation, the possibility of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities is only beginning to be considered.
The Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Policy of the EIT, Michael Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at reducing the demand for road travel - a case that is known to be unpopular - can be taken by society only if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its vehicle fleet, where there are two clusters of less sensitive to any regulatory effects - service and personal cars, as well as vehicles of "privileged" users, with a total of at least 200,000 (about 5 per cent of the total number of the Moscow vehicle fleet).
The other day, an urban group from the ECM centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyses the balance of urban areas between housing, road cover and road transport.
The main findings of the researchers: the city centre is provided with roads that are twice as much as required, and most of the motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them on parking or on the streets for a long time.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking, but vehicle storage, not to expand, but to reduce the carriageway (to make the streets more friendly for pedestrians), and to limit the use and deployment of personal transport within the border of the protection zone of the historic centre (a total area of about 3212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
The penalties for unauthorized street trade in Volokwhere will rise in size
In the view of the urban authorities, an increase in fines would help to establish order in Volokwhere and free the streets from natural tents and boats.
Most street traders do not pay taxes, the products they sell are often not subject to appropriate health control.
Which means that the health of the fibers is at risk.
For example, the lower penalty for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase six times, from 500 roubles to 3,000 roubles, and the press service of the Vologda Administration reports.
Goldman Sachs warned about the risks to the Russian economy.
Goldman Sachs warned about the growing risks to Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payment of unsecured consumer credit and massive reductions in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of that growth.
In the recent past, it is entirely due to consumption, which is almost not slowing down, "stated the main economist of Goldman Sachs for Russia, Clemens Grafe, who presented a quarterly report on the Russian economy to the investor bank yesterday.
The nominal wage growth in Russia is now about 10%.
With an inflation of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, expected in Goldman Sachs.
But the cost-effectiveness of Russian companies is falling, so they are likely to optimize staff costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages increase by 10 per cent, GDP, by only 2 per cent, explained by Mr. Grafe.
Companies have experienced a decline in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to dismissal and an increase in unemployment.
The Russian business cannot raise its wages, commenting on the main economist of Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS, Vladimir Pantusin.
Unemployment near the historical minimum, competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise their salaries in order to redirect staff from outside or keep the current ones.
Russia's consumption of the sub is also living on a very rapid increase in its consumption.
In his view, because of the very high rates on consumer loans, this type of credit did not have a multiplier effect on the country's economy.
"The benefits to the economy from increased consumption of credit have not been seen, the money is not divided by the economy, but return to the same banks in the form of interest payments," said the economist.
But the problem is, Goldman Sachs is waiting for an increase in the unsecured credit arrears.
They are taken mainly by poor people who have nothing to provide.
The interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more often, "Mr. Grafe noted.
Therefore, the second threat to economic growth in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payment of unsecured credit.
The Director of the WTE Vassily Solodkov Banking Institute is already seeing signs of an emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the low-cost resources available to public banks, were forced to attract high-interest funds from the population.
In response, State banks have reached the war path and have begun to lower credit rates, a continuing economist.
Small credit organizations cannot issue loans under the same interest, or they will have a negative interest margin.
If State banks do not give up dumping, Russia is facing a full-fledged banking crisis, Vassily Solodkov believes.
The fact that a number of banks have been denied licences in recent weeks is considered by the economist to be a precursor to mass collapse.
"The State banks themselves will not be able to deal with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed to address the system crisis," the head of the institution warns.
But consumption growth will slow down without a crisis of non-payment, believed in an investor bank, because of the non-indexing of the salaries of public servants and of the military, as set out in the current version of the budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of natural monopolies (and, as a result, the reduction of inflation).
But only in part: if investment does not increase (and the preconditions for that are not yet - see the certificate), consumption growth will still slow, convinced Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushin of Barclays Capital is not yet looking at the preconditions for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still a fall in the price of oil," he said.
He estimated that Russia's economy would begin to decline at a cost of oil below $90 / barr.
In Goldman Sachs, it was also noted that the ECB is not yet in a position to reduce the economic interest rates.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has declined and banks have begun to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the CBI that announced the transition to inflation, "said Clemens Graff.
The interest policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, only affects inter-bank lending rates.
"For the CBI, it's a failure of all hopes," Clemens Graff appreciated.
The funds received at the CBMs' auction are not used by banks to credit the economy, but to manage their liquidity.
Once the rate is down, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go into speculation against the ruble.
"Sooner or later, the ECB will understand that this strategy is not working," Mr. Grafe said, and recalled that the State is planning to put a rouble into "free swimming" by the end of 2015.
But you have to either do it before or raise the key price of the ECB (5.5%), he thinks.
According to his assessment, the ruble is now artificially high by 10%.
The Ruble is only one road, to be weak, and the expert concludes.
But if the KB makes any doubt in the financiers that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy of reducing the rouble, it could put a lot more pressure on the rouble.
The second South Ural Congress was held in Chelyabinsk.
The Forum is held on the occasion of the Day of People & apos; s Unity, the 400-year anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20-year anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The Congress was attended by delegations from all the cities and regions of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations and legislative and executive bodies, with a total of about 350 persons.
The forum is aimed at strengthening inter-national harmony.
We can set an example here not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no differences or differences.
We live in a full understanding, "Feofan says," Mr. Chelyabinsky and Mr. Zlatoustovsky. "
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the promotion of patriotism and cultural cooperation.
The Congress resulted in the adoption of a resolution.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
An exhibition of the national cultural associations of the Chelyabin region has been opened here.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on a US intelligence issue.
Edward Snowden, a US intelligence unsub, said he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, could not answer questions about his activities.
The German deputy, Hans-Christian Ströbele, met on Thursday with Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, who was represented by the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "While the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements by criminal charges that do not provide any protection."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the US Government to give up criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of the Interior, reported to Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense after allegations that the NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, a member of the parliamentary group responsible for the intelligence service, said that if it was possible to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, "without endangering him or destroying his relationship with the United States completely," it should be used.
Mr. Ströbele, a member of Parliament from the Green Germany Party, published his picture with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to counsel for the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snodeen would not have been able to return to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snodeen had testified in Germany, he would have needed assurances that he would be "safe" there, said the deputy.
Mr. Snodeen said in his letter that he had faced a "hard and constant" campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave his home.
He said, however, that he was encouraged by the global response to his "political statements."
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level officials - including in the United States - have found the discovery of an uncontrolled system of all-penetrating surveillance useful to society.
The letter offers to cooperate with the German authorities "when the humanitarian situation is resolved."
Frontier Airlines will charge for the manual storage
Frontier Airlines is planning to collect up to $100 from passengers for carrying a hand-held flight.
Frontier Airlines is planning to start charging up to $100 for a handbag and $2 for coffee or soda, although their announcement on Wednesday was that the passengers would be able to keep the whole bank.
The new manual storage fee is applied to the bags in the upper baggage compartments, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said that he would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if the travelers were paid only when they got to the landing.
The representative of Frontier Kate O'Malley said that a $100 fee should make the passengers take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge for it," she said.
The airlines started charging for the first and second bag in 2008.
The passengers who try to avoid these charges shall fill as much as they can in the manual storage room placed in the upper baggage compartments, which is often the result of a lack of space in these compartments.
The fees are one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new fee wasn't really about making money.
The point is that the most loyal clients of Frontier claim that it is increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper baggage compartments.
The passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not be required to pay.
This means that one passenger in line at the entrance to the Frontier flight may be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in line can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the change in procedures on the website and at the Frontier registration stations was intended to ensure that passengers would know about the collection before they reached their landing.
The new Frontier manual floor fee will not begin to be charged before summer, although the date is not yet set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of baggage is worth money, and the passengers who need this service have to pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges to be a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of flights after several years of loss.
However, most of them did not deal with manual storage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual deposit fee three years ago, and another Allegiant Air dissoner later followed her example.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said by J. Sorensen's airline consultant, who is closely monitoring the additional charges.
According to his assessment in a December 2011 report, the manual-floor fee is worth $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines top manager, recently flew on a Spirit flight, and he was interested that he would find out at the entrance when passengers faced an unusual Spirit collection behind the hand floor.
"The landing process was the most smooth thing I've ever seen in my airline career," he said.
I was expecting to see a tooth cross and a fight at the landing.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing went fast."
Frontier also follows Spirit for $2 per coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who received soda or juice could keep the whole bank and that a lot of coffee would be provided free of charge.
She will continue to give free water.
US Airways tried for a short time to charge for drinks in 2008, but refused to do so seven months after the passengers started complaining and no other major airline followed its example.
The Frontier Manual Paid Initiative, when passengers do not buy tickets directly from an airline, is its last step to attract clients to their website.
Airlines pay online tickets such as Orbitz, between $10 and $25 for each sold ticket.
This has given all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than to go to a travel online agency.
However, Frontier has gone beyond everything in this area.
In September, it began to give twice as many bonus miles as a frequently flying passenger to clients who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the bonus number to 25% of the travel miles.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip from Frontier, acquired from an online travel agency, would have made it possible to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only choose a place in advance if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown, Denver, but her business is declining and becoming a loss.
The output fell by 9 per cent and the flight capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results published on Wednesday by the Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to correct Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sales.
The NSA is blaming the "internal error" and not the hackers for the closure of the site.
The secret-held National Security Agency stated on Friday night that the closure of their site for a few hours had caused a technical failure, not hackers, as claimed on the network.
"NSAA.gov was not available for a few hours this evening because of an internal error that occurred during a planned update," reported to the intelligence agency in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The claims that the interruption was caused by a distributed "denial of service" [DDoS] attack are not true.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems registered that the NSA site had not been operational for at least six hours, and the site was still not available to some users.
Previously, an NSA representative told ABC News that the Agency's internal secret network had not been "hacked."
No classified information is in danger, as reported by the representative.
At least one online group of hacker activists stated that it was responsible for the destruction of the NSA site through DDoS attacks.
DDoS attacks are designed to cover the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site has failed.
The hacker tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the super-secret NSA, once called "No Such Agency," has been at the centre of public attention and violent criticism in recent months after a series of stories about its extensive surveillance programmes abroad and within the country, all of which is a response to the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and published by a disappointed former NSA employee, Edward Snowden.
The growing debate around the agency has led to the fact that today & apos; s incident was the result of targeted hackers.
The profits of Bombardier are falling with the drop in the delivery and number of aircraft orders
The Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net profits on Thursday, as a result of the reduced number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway unit.
The Montreal-based Bombardier also did not publish any data on the summer tests of its latest CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide new information on whether ambitious plans to put the aircraft into commercial use would be implemented by the next September.
After the first flight of the pilot aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it only flew three more times, raising questions as to whether the schedule test was under way.
The results did not meet the projections and led to a fall of more than 8 per cent in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst of the National Bank Financial, reduced his estimate on Thursday from "above average market" to "medium market" because of the belief that the growth of shares is limited in the next quarter or two.
"While the decline in the number of aircraft was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the return of the transport department," said Doerksen in the stock market review.
We believe that Bombordier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to be more skeptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first pilot of the aircraft was submitted in March and flew for the first time in September after several months of delay.
However, firm orders for CSeries are not yet too high - 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to verify the company & apos; s fuel efficiency claims and the potential cost-effectiveness of the new liner.
A total of 403 orders and arrangements are now available with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Officer, Pierre Boduan, was confident that Bombordier would reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft was launched into commercial operation.
On Thursday, managers also assured analysts and media that the programme was moving forward on the plan.
"The test model of the aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected," said Boduan during the telephone conference, adding that ground testing and software upgrades were planned during the time the aircraft was standing.
All manufacturers plan the tests in different ways.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break at the update, and that's what we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test programme.
The second of the five test pieces is due to fly in the coming weeks and all others will follow it soon, as the company has reported.
And yet analysts are sceptical about the statement that the first client will be able to start operating the CSeries 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier stated that it was assessing the date of entry into service and would provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight tests - although apparently in line with the Bombardier internal schedule - supports our view that the start-up will be carried over to the first quarter of 2015," said Dearksen.
In the third quarter, ending on 30 September, the net income of Bombordier fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per stock, from $172 million or 9 cents per stock last year.
The adjusted equity return remained the same, at 9 cents.
Gross income declined slightly, from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per stock and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world & apos; s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it had delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, a decrease from 57 in the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26.
The order portfolio of the Air Space Division was $32.9 billion on September 30, not changed since December 31.
"In the space field, the results were in line with our objectives, but the low number of orders received and the general market conditions were an unpleasant factor," said Boduan.
Gross space income fell by 13 per cent, to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world & apos; s largest train producer, reported that gross income in this sector had increased by almost 11 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
The order portfolio in the transport unit was $32.6 billion on September 30, a slight increase from December 31.
The revenue of the transport unit was adversely affected by problems in the performance of several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombordier's shares, which also announced that Google's Chief Finance Director Patrick Pickett would be on the board of directors, fell by 8.5 per cent to C $4.83 in mid-Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial airline manufacturer in the world and the closest competitor of Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony is counting on a lower annual profit.
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony Corporation, has reduced the profit forecast for the current fiscal year by completing the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million.
The results of Sony from July to September 2013 were more disappointing than expected, owing to the decline in demand for television, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which in the second quarter brought the company its first operating gain of 5.2 billion yen in three years, again fell to 9.3 billion yen in operational loss during the reporting period.
The Japanese market for consumer electronics is going through difficult times, especially as the demand for television has declined.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of the main competitors of Sony, Panasonic, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components: the sales of companies are growing at a high rate, especially through vehicle systems and environmentally sound technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to make 179 billion yen of operating profits against the expected 230 billion yen.
According to Thomson Reuters, however, analysts expected that the figure would be much higher, at 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding the product line.
In the middle of this month, the sale of smart hours from a Japanese corporation, with a number of fashion functions, was announced, which would make it possible to remove 100 times a day from the smartphone pocket.
After Sony reduced the annual profit and revenue forecast, the company's shares lost more than 11% in the morning at the Tokyo launch, falling to 1668 yen per item.
The speech genus was an incentive for synapse education.
Scientists from John Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School have found a protein that has led to the "speech gene" of Foxp2 acting as a catalyst for new neurons.
The study is published in Science and can be read on the magazine's website.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene that is directly related to the speech.
It was possible to establish its role in 2001 through the identification of a family of several people who were unable to speak correctly and sometimes not even understand each other.
Scientists found that the work of the Foxp2 gene had been disrupted by family members, but how it performed its function was not known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their functions, Foxp2 acts as a catalyst for the formation of new synapses in the brain related to speech formation.
It does so thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was found as a result of the search for factors that encourage the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 such genes found by the authors, and only its activity is affected by Foxp2.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vocation has been confirmed by scientists in an experiment on mice.
When the activities of the gene were artificially reduced in animals, they were less screaming when they were separated from their mother.
If gene activity has been restored, the frequency of sound produced has also been restored.
In the past, the mice also showed a connection to the vocation of Foxp2 itself.
Animals that were supplied with a human copy of the gene were more likely to eat at a lower frequency than ordinary mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, therefore, its SRPX2 are linked to the "mechanical" properties of sound formation or more subtle processes.
A cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the head of a criminal group about a police investigation was imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditta gave information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would be solved.
He was sentenced to three years & apos; imprisonment by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told a drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
A 42-year-old Basharat Ditta provided criminal authority to Neil Scarboro with secret information on his investigation into drug trafficking activities after being threatened by his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer who had received the name Bash and had been called a "cool lawyer" among the criminals was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation on Scarborough, which he had previously represented in a drug court.
The officers observed that 32-year-old Scarborough left three cocaine bags at the lawyer's house in Blackburn County, Lankashir, while he was at a bar association dinner with his colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta "used" a class A drug on a regular basis after the tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
During the eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information on the arrest of two persons on behalf of Scarboro, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police supervision at that time as part of an extensive investigation into the activities of the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Mercisade, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
A 42-year-old Ditta was passing information on to the criminals because he was afraid that his cocaine addiction would be revealed.
Today, at the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditt, which works for the law company Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was disgraced after having been found guilty in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at the Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to possession of cocaine at a previous trial.
The disclosure of the lawyer took place after the police investigating Scarborough found out that he had been on the phone with Ditt on a regular basis since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found out how he approached Dit's house in Blackburn and put 60% clean drugs in a black golf glove under a lawyer's dumpster.
Shortly after the show, Scarborough called many times with Ditt, who was at a dinner at the Iwood Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rover team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine talks were held between them.
The court found that Ditta "used" cocaine on a regular basis after the tests found traces of a class A drug in his hair, wallet and his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspect dealer because he was his client and insisted that their communication was a "lawyer's secret."
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and he also had a hair sample.
In an interview with the police, he said that, along with his job, he had a home office, and his clients came to his house on legal matters.
However, the Court was aware that, following important arrests, he had called the largest drug traffickers, a number of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell them that they were known to the detectives.
In an indictment, Anne White said, "If anyone knows that there should be no violation of the law, it is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, as he has been in too close relations with certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who provides drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will certainly be legal, as he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the legal and client lines.
It has prevented police investigations as much as possible to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not respect his profession, but he disgraced it.
He was too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he questioned his lack of interest.
Ditta did not confess guilt and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, whom I am not, and I would like to give Mr. Scarborough information, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done so immediately."
But after the meeting, senior officer Lee Halstead of the Lankashir police said, "Mr. Ditta has become a criminal criminal criminal lawyer as soon as he has started to purchase drugs from organized crime."
His addiction to cocaine has made him unjustifiably compromised and vulnerable to the main actors of criminal groups who have instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and give public confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover his profession.
Mr. Ditt & apos; s case was investigated by the Lankashir unit for particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine storage, and now also to obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire for a fair punishment for the perpetrators.
Let this case serve as a warning to the perpetrators that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after having pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 persons involved in the fraud were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related offences.
On his website, Ditta organized a question-and-answer interview, in which he said that his dream work was a lawyer representing the death-penalty clients in America, an ideal companion for him at dinner, Mohammed Ali, and the motivation for his work was inequality.
The Yaroslava stadium is not ready to receive 22,000 viewers, and police officers who were present today at a meeting of the RFF KDC.
The ticket program is, in their view, about twice as high.
During the 1 / 16 match of the Russian Cup with Spartacus, only a thousand steward was used, with a standard of 9,000.
The Spartacos had 2,200 seats, 10 per cent of the stadium's capacity, but, in agreement with the Moscow Club, 5,000 tickets were sold to them.
This data was read by the head of the KDC, Arthur Grigorians.
The Americans were listening to Japanese high-level officials.
On Friday, 1 November, a representative of the United States Special Services, who chose not to reveal his name, said that the States had been listening to telephone calls from high-level Japanese officials.
The man confirmed that there were several listening points in the country of the rising sun.
He noted, however, that the US, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand did not engage in intelligence activities against each other.
He said that was the case during the Second World War, when those countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite its post-war relationship with Americans, is a target for intelligence activities, NHK reported.
The information has not yet been formally commented on by either party.
Let's just say the news about the U.S. Special Services tracking the German Chancellor came up last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to tap Merkel's phone for the last 10 years.
The Chancellor himself, according to some reports, has taken the news of his wire very painfully.
She stated that the allies, which she considered to be the German and the United States for decades, were not acceptable for such monitoring of the head of Government.
In the meantime, Edward Snowden stated that he was ready to share details of Angela Merkel's phone service with the German Public Prosecutor's Office.
The German came to Moscow on purpose to meet a former CIA staff member.
Bashkiria can put the grain on the trade before the beginning of 2014
The Baskiria, during government procurement interventions, may not bid grain before the beginning of 2014, and is considered by the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic, Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not encourage sales to the intervention fund.
So far, the market price is higher, and there's demand.
"Maybe the grain will be put on the market after New Year's," he said at a press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that during the current year, 3.1 million hectares of crops were under harvest in 2013, including 1.7 million hectares of cereals, an increase of 3.3 per cent over last year.
The 2014 harvest was 550,000 hectares (105,000 hectares more than in 2012).
The area under the tin wheat and triticale has been increased, and the rots have remained at the same level.
There is no "Bratsky Circle" group in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, to which Leps was assigned in the United States.
The databases of the Russian security forces of the Brothsky Circle, to which Washington listed the singer Gregory Leps, do not include.
As noted by Interfax in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after reports of Grigory Leps being placed on the control lists by the United States Department of Finance on suspicion of being a member of the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Bratsky Circle," all databases were checked, but no such group was found.
The dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which is said to be operating abroad, is considered by the security forces.
"Even in the very name, 'The Brotherhood Circle', there is some element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret lie.
"It's all very much like a PR action," said the agency's interviewer.
On 31 October, the United States Department of Finance announced that it had been placed on its control lists on suspicion of being a member of the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Bratsk Circle" Arthur Badalan, Grigoria Lepsveridze, Wadim Ljalin, Sergei Moscalenko, Yakov Rybalski and Igor Slykov.
The individuals on the list are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who have been considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on the United States sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the United States authorities, Grigory Lepps "is a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev."
At the Grigory Leps production centre, they refused to comment on the US's allegations against the singer, calling them "delusional."
In 2011, US President Barack Obama identified the "Bratsky Circle" syndicate as "significant transnational organized criminal groups" and instructed the Minphin "to undermine and prohibit their global criminal operations."
The blacklisting of an American minphin would result in the freezing of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contact with him by persons living in the States.
The Scandal video got into the police.
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and unwittingly reckless activities, was caught smoking crack.
The Canadian City Police have stated that they have a video and are ready to start an investigation against the City Chief.
He stated that he would not leave his post, reporting CNN.
The information that the authorities had evidence of the use of drugs by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto police website.
The head of local law enforcement agencies, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this issue.
The sheriff said that he was not authorized to share these personnel with the public, but that he was given a chance to do so.
According to Blair, a compromise of Rob Ford's video was found during an anti-drug raid by security guards in the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had previously written that video, but until recently there had been no evidence.
The mayor himself does not comment on this.
He just says it's not his fault and he's not going to resign.
The video recorded by the police is one of the evidence in the case of a 35-year-old friend, Ford Alexander Lisi, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illegal revenue and criminal conspiracy.
He sometimes served as the driver of Rob Ford.
The city has long demanded the resignation of its mayor.
He had repeatedly fought journalists, appeared in public in a drunken form, and allowed himself racist and sexist speech.
The "Rostovaeroinvest" was recognized by the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender, selected by the object's gendesigner.
The contract is not disclosed at Rostovaeroinvest.
According to information from the UAO press service, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition and, under the terms of the tender, the project is to be prepared and sent for State assessment in spring 2014.
The winner is to design a new airport passenger terminal, as well as infrastructure, inland roads and airport improvement elements.
In the first phase of the construction, the inside area of the terminal would be 50,000 square metres and could be further increased.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the project documents will take into account the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and by 2035 6 million passengers.
By the time the tender was taken up, the architectural concept of the "South" aeronauxal complex was established, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects.
The main terminal project embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-na-Don and other cities in the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in major projects, and the company has designed terminals C and E of the "International Airport of Šerustijevo" and a new aeronauxal complex at the international airport "Kniveci" in Vladivostok.
The international airport complex "South" will be built in the Aksai district of Rostov region and will replace the existing rost airport, which will be closed and, in the future, integrated into urban development.
The construction of the aeronautics complex is scheduled to begin in 2014, and the introduction of all facilities is scheduled for 2017.
A politician in Turkey has declared a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria.
In mid-October, the authorities began construction of the separation wall in the area of Nusaybin in south-east Turkey.
The local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish party, PMD, have strongly opposed construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin Aish Geckhan, on the border with Syria, declared a hunger strike against the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, and told RIA News at the Press Service of the Party for Peace and Democracy (PMD) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly launched protests.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muammer Güler, first denied the construction, then stated that the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"The Mayor of Nusaybina Aisha Geckhan, a member of the PMD, declared a hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," they stated in the party's press service.
The city's mayor believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish people of the two countries from each other, and that the Kurds have crossed the border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhuman situation that the Kurds will never agree with," they quote Aisha Gekhan from the party.
According to the press service, a meeting against the construction of the separation wall is scheduled for 7 November in Nusaybin.
Venezuela will set a exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange course for its national currency - the Bolívar - against the dollar for tourists.
On 1 November, Bloomberg reported this with reference to a government decree.
Foreign travellers will be allowed to exchange the equivalent of US $10,000 per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the country & apos; s bolivars at the time of departure.
A specific rate of bolívar against the dollar will be established at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devaluation local currency to 6.3 bolívar per dollar.
However, in the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolívar.
Since the beginning of the year, the Bolívar has lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 per cent.
The Minister of the Petroleum Industry and Vice-President of the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, stated on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to devaluation the bolivar.
According to informal information provided by the agency, Caracas could still decide to lower the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of containing prices of products and goods of high consumption, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, have led to a shortage of a number of products and to the functioning of the black exchange market.
In the spring of this year, the media wrote that there was a lack of toilet paper in Venezuela.
The Director of Yugra, Andrei Belmach, noted that it was still difficult to say how long it would take to find a new main coach.
The post was vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so to tell you how long it would take to find a new coach, I'm not ready, is what the ITR-TAS says to Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're looking into all possible options.
Priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
I don't just want to find a coach, but a man who's been working at our club for a few years and will get some results on him.
The Kenyan press is outraged by the provocative media law
"This is a terrible place, and there are reasons for the question: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?" said the newspaper, calling the law unconstitutional.
"This law is very severe and punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, the manager of the Capital Group, a parent company called CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and a news site.
He said that the new media judiciary would "always be biased, as it was a continuation of the Government," and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's situation in the global economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to his deputies," he said.
According to The Star, the new law would in fact allow the government to "take the media with a dead grip," and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "had been hit seriously," and criticized the bill as "draconian."
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Centre.
The Kenyan media provoked the authorities & apos; anger by broadcasting security cameras where the troops who had been sent to the scene of the attack were allegedly robbing a road trade centre.
The response of the Chief of Police, David Kimayo, was to call two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the challenge was cancelled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publications could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists could be fined up to one million with an additional risk of being "removed from the list," a ban on official journalism accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyse most FM stations."
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on the so-called "vibrant blogosphere" of Kenya.
Politicians understand that by making the media shut up, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," written by a journalist, Nation Mutum Matthew, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of deterrence and balance in public life.
"The policies that are given to themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.
Kenyan legislators have also been targeted by public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to lift the cuts appointed by the National Payroll Commission and to restore their huge salary of about Ssh32,000 per month, one of the highest in the world.
There will be a new expenditure line in the communal payments of the riverine, which is the allocation for the major repairs of the house.
The most approximate calculation for the standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to be paid between 100 and 400 roubles per month.
The Government of the region will determine the exact standard.
But when you paint the access, you get the stairwell cells, or you even replace the elevator, it's up to the tenants.
This law was approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Kluitnikov, President of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, too, it is necessary to establish order: to prioritize the carbonate of houses, to accumulate funds not in the management of companies - which we often have in Moscow and in Orenburg, or elsewhere, to establish State control over the spending of the funds that the residents collect for the renovation of multi-family homes."
State control is now also the construction of equity.
The law protecting against fraudsters was approved by a final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 45,000 people have been affected by dishonest developers.
Most of the problems have been resolved.
By the way, the new law sets out the rights and obligations for all those involved in the construction of the stock.
Vladimir Kluknikov, President of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that there have also been abuses in this area because of the fact that in the '98, the milkmen were the same, and in the 2000's, the same elders."
People started making money to cover a loophole, including the adoption of these two laws.
Under Voronezh, it was decided to build a temporary stay centre for foreign nationals subject to deportation.
The Regional Parliament has passed such a law not only under federal pressure.
The problems associated with illegal migrants in the region are at least negligible.
In the past year, for example, there were just over 100,000 foreigners who had been registered for migration.
But only one in five made a formal work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Kluitnikov, President of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said, "They have violated the law but are not criminals."
There's no trial, and we have to deport them, we have to keep them somewhere.
The Federation has made such a decision that such places should be provided by regional means.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is defined as the Old Olshank of the Semipalatinsk region.
Well, after all, the regional parliament has given new benefits to many children.
First, families with 5 or more children are fully exempt from transport tax.
The budget in this case is lost by 3.5 million - but the same is the case for many children.
Second, and most importantly, those who adopt three or more children will be granted housing subsidies from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at a cost of 30,000 per metre.
The family, for example, is made up of six people - the father, the mother, the mother, the child and the third one adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the State is acquiring a housing area of 108 square metres, in 3 million 300,000 roubles.
For the left bank or the South-West region, it is a good option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage at the district center for that amount.
Baumgertner is nominated to the Board of Directors of Uralkalia.
The current Board of Directors of the Uraalkalia UAO has proposed the nomination of the Director-General of the Ministry of Health, Vladislav Baumgertner, who is arrested in Minsk, for the new composition of the Council, to be reported on the website of the Russian company.
Bamugertner is on the list of 11 persons nominated to the new board of directors.
The list was prepared for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on 29 November, at which a new board of directors would be established by a vote.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
At the time of his detention in August this year, he was charged with abuse of authority.
However, President Belorusia Alexander Lukashenko later stated at a press conference that the accusations of Baumgertner had been requalified as "embezzlement."
The Neftechimics soldier, Matt Dalton, refused to comment on the withdrawal of Vladimir Krikunov from his position as a lower-town mentor.
Holkipper believes that the acting Chief Coach, Dmitri Balmin, has a great deal of authority from the players and will be able to carry out his duties.
Let's just say the Neftechimic has resigned Krikunov today.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov, quoted by Dalton RIA "News."
I can only say that Dmitri Balmin will be able to meet his obligations - I have no doubt.
He has a great deal of authority on the team, and this young professional is definitely looking forward to a great future.
The lawyer of the Juventus, Leonardo Bonucci, will not help the team in the near Italian Parma Championship.
According to Fotball Italia, the coach's headquarters decided not to include it in the game's application to save the fourth round of the "Real" group round of the League of Champions.
Also, they will not take part in a fight with "Parma" Lichtsteiner, Vucinich and Pepe.
And forward Fabio Kvallarella recovered from his injury and is ready to play.
A tax manoeuvre that increases the oil tax (NDPI) at the same time as export duties are reduced and excise increases will lead to fuel consumption.
In the view of the experts, these measures could bring an additional 619.3 billion roubles into the budget.
The president of the Krasnoyarskaya Court was taken from his head.
Unknown men attacked the President of the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court, Vladimir Dvoykonko, stealing his permit.
According to Interfax, late Wednesday night, the culprits hit the judge on the head, and he lost consciousness.
When the 63-year-old president of the court came to his senses, he found that he had been removed from his office card.
The money and other values were not taken by the criminals.
The two of you made it home on their own, and the police only got a call the next day.
The investigation of the crime and the search for the criminals are under way.
The "Zenita" fans on the official site of the club recognized the ex-captain of Russia as the best player in the past month.

US Secretary of State: Special Services sometimes "went too far" when collecting data
United States Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that, when collecting data and wire, American special services sometimes "went too far," but the politician noted that 70 million people were not in line with the media.
I assure you that innocent people did not suffer during this process, but there was an attempt to collect information.
Yes, in some cases, this has been too far and illegal.
I recognize that, as the President recognizes... and we will ensure that this does not happen in the future, "quote Secretary of State AFP.
Italian workers with old age give way to young people
Italian unemployment is on record.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5 per cent of the population was now unemployed.
This has not been so bad since World War II.
The rate is several times higher among young people.
40.4% of the population between the ages of 15 and 24 are unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is early retirement of older workers.
This exercise is already being carried out by the country & apos; s largest energy company, and the laws that have been adopted allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for long-term workers.
On the other hand, Italy is waiting for an ageing population common to Europe.
And economists are not sure that a prematurely rotated staff will be justified.
This will result in the construction of a TSP in Moscow.
With each year, the capital authorities promise to build more and more transport and transplants (TPNs).
It is planned that 255 TPNs will be operational until 2020.
What the project actually turns out to be, our correspondent was in the process.
A few months ago, a building fence was built at the Smolensky subway of the Arbatsk-Poblon Line.
The inscription said that the transport and transfer hub was being set up.
This was all very strange, as no ground transport is stopped near Smolensky and therefore no one can move on it.
In order to reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, some 130 metres must be overcome, including a ground crossing across the Carmanica alley.
It's almost over now at the Smolensky.
The florist is gone, the paper stand has been dismantled, and the asphalt has been replaced by a brusher before the entrance.
That's the whole transport knot.
The transport and transplants are both flat and capital, and are explained in the press service of the Central Department of Transport.
There are no capital TPNs yet.
And the planes include parking, the withdrawal of commercial facilities that prevent the movement of passengers, small architectural forms and improvements.
In fact, the TSS is not even carried out by carriers, but by professional welfare workers from the capital maintenance department of Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex design, and is explained by the Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics, Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes there are enough roofs over the head and a placard to alert the arrival time of the transport.
The Yasenevo subway, for example, has recently opened a fully-fledged airborne transplant node.
Let it be without the scales, but with the intercepting parking and the placards that indicate when the bus is coming.
But in pursuit of the number, the officials record everything on the TSP.
As early as 2011, the mayor was planning to build all 151 knot, 59 of them with capital construction.
There are now 255 TPNs in the plans until 2020.
Of these, a half-hundred have been promised this year.
Although there is a programme for the development of TDP in the city, there are no qualitative criteria, as noted by Alexander Morozov, Co-Chairman of the Public Organization "City and Transport."
The number of sites is reported, but the quality of the transplants on each is often deteriorating.
The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: first, a reduction in the time of transplants, second, a ease.
First of all, it is possible to change the mode of transport without falling under the rain.
In Moscow, however, when the TPS is established, it is sometimes the opposite.
It's a good example of the "HDV" subway.
In the past, the Yaroslavskaya highway suburban buses came to the square before the main entrance to the OCE.
Their stops have now been moved to the other side of the Yaroslaka on the street of the Cosmonauts.
Far from the subway, far further from the monorel, but closer to the homes.
It's a gift that the people didn't want a bus station under the windows and complained to all possible authorities.
I didn't get a deal with the capital TPG in Moscow at once.
The first of them started building five years ago at the Underground.
The project was designed to be a model.
And indeed, there's a model of how the transplant node, which has been given to investors, is turning into a banal trading centre.
No, there's a bus perron, a curtain to keep the subway out of the rain, and three floors of parking.
It is true that the Himkin trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPG have not been given seats in principle.
They were moved away from the subway like others.
But there's more to the trade.
It's just the clothes of 32 shops, and there's almost everything, from the zoos to the car salon.
Well, in fact, which one of the bus passengers would need to buy a new car on the road?
We have a mall when we build a capital TSS.
The situation had recently reached its logical conclusion when a part of the parking lot had decided to be put on the market.
Now, on the third floor of the TPG, the "Planer" is a booty trade among the floor-marked parking spaces.
The sheep, the spices, the Chinese jeans, the non-Russian speech, and the guards who are looking at our photographer.
The transplant node has finally become a bazar.
The thing is, the "Planer" subway used to have a market, but it was destroyed.
And in the Prefecture, the dealers were burned and let into an intercepting parking lot of a transplant node.
Still, because of high prices, it's always empty.
The funny thing is, the market was destroyed to build a new, flat TSS.
That's a rookie.
The distance of the approach from the subway lobby to the bus is 50 metres at the Kaluzsky subway, as Alexander Morozov says.
After the construction of a trade centre, allegedly the TPG, the distance has increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the whole mall.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, it has to be outdoor.
However, the structures on the Planer and the Kaluzsky will soon be shown to be flowers.
In mid-September, the City Town Planning and Land Commission approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPNs.
Four of them will be 25-storey, except for two or three underground arches.
The main monster will grow at the Tusino subway, with 418,000 square metres of area.
The representatives of the RZD railway station department responsible for the construction of the TVU at the subway have already told the journalists that shops, hotels and apartments will be distributed in future multi-storeies.
At the same time, officials are confident that the multi-tiered parking is a third to half-square.
Let's take an example of "people's" garage.
Let's say the garage in 258 cars, which has recently been built on International Street, has an area of 8015 square metres.
So, for a parking party of 2.6 thousand cars, Petrovsko-izomovsky will need about 80,000 square.
It's less than a third of the mahina they're going to build there.
Let one or two floors go to all kinds of bus perrons.
At least 150,000 square metres of commercial real estate remain.
And this, for a minute, is almost two GMA.
If the main TPNs are built at stations and stations, the remaining sites will be developed by metropolytenovans.
They also promised that there would be many "functional facilities," including hotels, offices and even gym.
By the way, in the Department of Property of the City of Moscow, it was recently reported to journalists that a draft regulation was being prepared to allow investors to apply directly to the officials for a TSS site.
No contests.
Because I wish transport was a priority for the city.
The perfect TPG is, for example, a Harvard station in Boston or Spadina in Toronto, I'm sure Alexander Morozov.
There, trolleybuses and trams go underground to the subway level and the distance from the subway to the tram is only 50 metres without going outside.
There's no trade around.
But Moscow officials are being thrown into extremes.
Either we don't build anything, or we're gonna kill 25 floors of office and apartment.
Eser proposes that an insult to patriotic feelings be equated to extremism.
In order to protect by law the patriotic feelings of citizens against the provocations and insults directed against Russia, "just Russia" proposes that the insult of patriotic feelings be equated to extremist activities and that five years of prison be punished.
According to the newspaper "News," such legislative amendments prepared by the castle of the Danube Energy Committee, Oleg Miheev, have already been sent for an opinion to the Supreme Court and the Government.
By the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional relationship of a person with a country of which he is a national, characterized by love for that country, responsible for its fate, respect for its history and culture.
According to Miheev, domestic legislation contains sanctions for abuse of the official signs of State authority, the flag and the emblem.
In the view of Parliament, however, the protection of Russians whose feelings may be affected and insulted by State symbols and other forms of disrespect for our country is not sufficiently developed in Russian legislation.
As an example, he cited the annual debate on the eve of Victory Day, when some media persons had made it possible to question the heroic movement of the people of the USSR in the fight against fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - the Day of Victory on 9 May - a real vakhanalia is being launched every year.
As a practice of wit and an "alternative view" of history, some publicists come to the point that, it is a shame that the cultural Germans have not won the wild Soviet Union!
I believe that this is absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride for history remains the main "spiritual scraper" of the nation, which is outraged by Oleg Miheev.
In addition, according to Miheev, there are many more patriotic people in Russia than religious people, but the law punishes the feelings of believers, and it is almost impunity to insult patriotic feelings.
In the opinion of the people & apos; s elected person, it is necessary to equate the abuse of patriotic feelings with extremist activities and to impose appropriate penalties in article 282nd of the Criminal Code.
The draft law provides for the punishment of insulting patriotic feelings, ranging from a 100-thousand fine to 5-year imprisonment.
The 6.6 earthquake took place on Thursday, 31 October, in the area of Kokimbo, central Chile, and is being handed over to Reuters.
The earthquake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 km and at a distance of 54 kilometres south-west of the city, on the site of the United States Geological Service (USGS).
The numbers were recorded at 20: 03 local time (3: 03 on 1 November Moscow).
The victims or the damage caused by the underground have not yet been reported.
We will recall that Chile is in one of the most seismic areas of the Earth, so earthquakes are not uncommon.
One of the most serious was in 2010.
At that time, the 8.8 earthquake and its tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile had the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960, there had been a 9.5 magnetude.
More than 5,000 people were killed as a result of that natural disaster.
Dmitri Medvedev: The Greenpeace case will be dealt with fairly
The Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, reported on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be dealt with in strict compliance with Russian law.
France has no doubt that the case will be dealt with in a manner consistent with the law, and we hear all concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the law," said Dmitri Medvedev at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero.
There is a French national among Greenpeace's detained activists.
Pierre Pizanu, like the other activists, is being charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quoted Mr. Ero's "RIA News."
"Our country cannot support activities that may harm the environment, no one is entitled to violate the laws," Dmitri Medvedev said.
He said that any structure that was trying to influence technological and unsafe processes, including energy production, was dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were "as a powder barrel" and recalled what had happened in the Gulf of Mexico, transmitting RIA News.
The United Nations declares new goals for poverty reduction
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of Millennium Development Goals targets, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty throughout the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in moving the "sustainable development goals" to replace the 2015 MDGs before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio on the eve of the evening.
They were included in the outcome document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit the other night that the time had come to "become above national interests."
"I am pleased that the UN member countries have agreed to launch and control the process of establishing the universal sustainable development goals - the SDGs," he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will make every effort to use the authority given to me by member countries to fulfil our vision of sustainable development goals that are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of powerful people
Under the statue of Samora Mashel, the founding President of Mozambique, which looks at them from above, thousands of people have gathered in the centre of Maputo to scandal the slogans of peace on one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, the executive director of the investment company.
In fear of her country's future, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt decorated with "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined a crowd on Thursday at the capital area of Independence.
In two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between Government forces and Renamo, one of the most violent clashes since the truce was concluded more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, which was first supported by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa as part of an effort to destabilize an independent Government of the country.
After the truce of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that it is unlikely that the country will again have a full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
The rates are high for a rapidly growing economy, as the opening of large-scale oil and coal reserves in the north-west can attract more than $50 billion as an investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling party, Freimo, who has been a political leader since 1975, and Renamo, have accused each other of the tension that has created.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government has become the host of recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
Attacks on former rebels then increased when Government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dchlakama, the group leader, reported to the financial Times Fernando Mazanga, a representative of Renamo.
The government is blaming Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Gebouza has tried to dispel concerns about instability.
Gebusa told the AFP, a French information agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dchlakama felt like a "loser" who wanted to use "everything left of his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government."
Both Freimo and Renamo insist on what they want to avoid war.
However, concerns were raised by reports that Mazanga had declared Renamo & apos; s rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He informed the Financial Times that he meant that the parties had failed to comply with the agreement by the Freimo party.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all seriousness," said Mazang.
The previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tension that has been exacerbated by the series of clashes this year.
"These are two powerful men (Gebusa and Dclokama) facing the forehead," said Joseph Hannon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by a weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
Renamo's vote rate has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which is based on a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebouza, who was due to resign next year, when his second term was over, wished to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mazang.
Renamo's capacity is not clear, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key road from north to south.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Beira, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, are using to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railway routes for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when he was asked whether Renamo would repeat that threat.
Renamo's party wanted to "warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not going well," said Mazanga.
Instability has increased government discontent, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent increase in kidnapping, as said by Fernando Lima, the head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
"People think that the Government and the President are responsible for the future of the country, who must find a solution to these problems," he said.
Omar Sultuan, a participant in the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Freimo, they just want peace back, they want free access to the roads," he said.
The "Art-Meinstream" premiere series will be held in Moscow.
The "Art-Mainstream" series, where the audience will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held at the "Roland" cinema from 1 to 5 November, and will report to the RIA "News" with reference to the project's organizers.
It will open up the "Art-Meinstrum" programme of the French comedy director and actress Reim Kerici, "Paris at all costs."
This is a story of the Mayan (Kerichi) model in the French capital, which is being deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to the film, Kerichi will also show a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duk "Mebius," a melodramatic biopic by Oliver Hirschbiegel, "Diana: The History of Love" (Diana), with Naomi Watts, as the main role and main film of the May Cann Film Festival, "The Life of Adel" Abdelatif Kesish.
The only Russian participant in the "Art-Mainstream" will be the winner of the "Kinotaur" film by Alexander Veledin "Geographer Globe" on the basis of a one-name novel by Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - the charming failure of Victor Service's teacher - was played in the film by Constantine Haben, whose work was also marked by the "Kinotaur" award.
Children must study myths and legends as "lifestyle models," the author says.
The words about the Torah could show that "gross force cannot defeat a sophisticated plot," and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
In saying that many myths will be "too wild, too scandalous and, in some cases, too indecent to teach in schools," Crossley-Holland is in favour of "careful selection" of age-appropriate texts.
"I think it's wonderful that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I was in favour of introducing them into the curriculum for 20 years.
He added that the "excessive moderation" of authors and teachers "was a disinterest of children, and the basic ideas of" sublimated "in fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the Beowulf from the English-Saxon language, and also wrote "The Norwegian Myths Digest" for Penguin and "British People's Files," said, "You may have intentions, but you better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps a great difference between adult author writing for adults and adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but that there should be a congenital understanding of good and evil.
And it has to be sublimated; it's revealed through history, not clearly defined.
The old principle is to show, not tell.
In Voronezh oblast, a football fan was detained, breaking a window in the station waiting room.
At 9 a.m. on 29 October, at the Gryazi-Voronezh station, the transport police removed from the passenger train two football fans from the Moscow region.
When they went to the game of the team's favorite, the guys on the way made a drunk debos on the train.
Young people were taken to the duty station of the line police at the Gryazi station to prepare a report on an administrative offence.
There, fans repented in their anti-social behavior.
The police made administrative records on them and released them.
The young people bought tickets to the next train and they were waiting at the station station station to arrive.
In the first half of the night, fans left the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old, suddenly returned and broke the front door window in the station waiting room.
A transport police officer and a security guard of the RZD "RZD" were at risk of a call to the broken glass.
They were able to arrest an intruder who was trying to escape the scene.
The personnel of the South-East LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation are subject to verification.
The issue of the initiation of criminal proceedings is being raised, and the Senior Directorate of Information and Public Relations of the South-East LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation has reported on the transport of Sergei Olhovik.
Vitaly Muchko: Water weapons?
I think we came back 15 years ago.
The Minister of Sports, Vitaly Muthko, expressed his opinion on the riots at the podium during the Russian Cup "Shinnik" match, "Spartacus."
I am committed to all of this being the responsibility of the organizers of sports events: clubs, the League, the RFS.
But we can see they're taking a good position.
They're waiting for someone to come from the outside and make it all right.
It's a very good position, but it's not exactly right.
We have to organize the fans, the clubs have to invite their steward, not let the case go to their own.
We have now drawn up a special government regulation on the rules of conduct at the stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will deal with this issue.
But I'm still going to have to invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedong's interview.
The state, please, let the law be quick.
It's like it's the Bavaria fans who came to Yaroslava and set it up.
And we're external observers.
In fact, it's terrible to see the podium polished out of the bradpoite.
And it's in a country that's preparing for the World Cup.
"I have a feeling that we were back 10 or 15 years ago," said Mutko.
Snowden can be questioned in Russia.
An ex-American special service officer, Edward Snowden, is likely not to travel outside Russia to testify on the phone-tapping cases of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.
As Interfax stated on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, an American can answer questions from the German Attorney General's Office in writing or in person in Russia.
The departure of Edward Snowden outside Russia is almost impossible.
"In this case, he would lose refugee status and could be granted to Washington by United States ally countries," said the agency's interviewee.
"In principle, however, the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federal Republic of Germany could send representatives to the Russian Federation or submit written questions to Snouden," added the source, adding that the matter should be addressed at the inter-State level.
A German Bundestag member, Hans-Christian Strebele, had previously reported that Edward Snowden was ready to testify in the case of the United States Special Negotiating Services of the German Chancellor.
Snowden is ready to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or on German territory.
An ex-CIA officer has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Although the US NSA has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, for this to happen, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival, "he told Strabela of Eurondei.
Snouden Anatoly Kuchren's lawyer, commenting on the Interfax source's statement, stated that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how it would decide.
A United States citizen, Edward Snowden, who worked for the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he released information on United States security surveillance operations on the Internet.
Snodeen was in transit through Moscow, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport was revoked by the United States authorities, which had brought serious charges against him in absentia, and remained in the transit zone of Sherustijevo airport until the beginning of August.
On August 1, Snodeen received a document on granting him temporary asylum in Russian territory for a period of one year and left "Sherumatijevo" on the same day.
Yesterday, an American lawyer, Anatoly Kuchren, stated that his client had entered a "large Russian company."
The NSA's surveillance of Angela Merkel last week was reported to the German media.
According to journalists, the Chancellor & apos; s phone calls began listening as early as 2002.
The surveillance station was allegedly at the United States Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, following the publication of the information, stated that monitoring Merkel violated Germany's laws and sovereignty.
Ponomarev left "The Fair Russia."
The State Duma's delegate from the "just Russia" party, a member of her office in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, applied for a withdrawal from a political organization.
According to the parliamentarians, he applied to the Party & apos; s new regional office.
According to her statute, it automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the "righteous."
We're sitting, having tea...
"For some reason, many want to see a picture of Ilya Ponomarev putting a partner on the table," but there is nothing so epoch, "the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintained a good relationship with the regional office of "esers."
However, the mandate of the member of the State Duma, Ilya Ponomarev, is not intended to be waived.
He explained that, despite his withdrawal from the party, he remained a member of the faction and could not leave it by law.
Reports of Ili Ponomarev's intention to leave the "just Russia" party appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitri Goodkov and Valery Zuba would be leaving the "CP" with him, but the latter soon denied the information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the issue of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese MID, Fumio Kishida, met with the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of political dialogue, on issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," said at the Kisid meeting.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that, following a visit to Russia by the Prime Minister of Japan, relations between countries had become more warm and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation would meet Japan on complex political issues and would write RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today, demanding that the land lost after the Second World War be returned to the country.
There are cars on the Japanese capital, from which the speaker says, "Return the northern territories!"
The police do not stop the protesters, they ensure that the noise level is not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New York
It can be said that New York is a place of birth of a stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, an aesthetic artist, Frank Fay, who worked as a conqueror at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a talking manner.
The new introduction of the Faye has, over time, taken over others, most recently the New York Comedian Festival.
The festival, established and run by Caroline Hursch, is the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, and is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows in small clubs and big theatres.
"Most of these headliners started at the Carolines, and then made more progress, reached a level where they were already too famous to play at the club," said Hursh.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes Wanda Sykes, Cathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the "Heroin Stendup," an annual music and comedy charity concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be among others.
The world of comedy has also expanded with the expansion of the festival.
A number of comedians participating in this year's festival have become popular in a non-traditional way, for example through a show on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll is known for his role in the comedy show on a small-known cable channel (a first-known FXX-based "League" on "Fentezi-football"), and is now playing his own "Comedy Central" sketch show.
Jenny Slater was a member of both "Saturday night live" and "Parks and rest areas," although she is most known for the "Marseille - A Rat in the Bottle" series.
Both Kroll and Slater, like other young comedians with an identity style (surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, a luscious, racial-focused Camau Bell), are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the most vivid moments of the festival will be an interview with David Steinberg and Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but then became a successful director on television and in the movies, as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the lead show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held in the Town Hall Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is certainly a central element of Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes went out on some street between the two houses, and he thought, "If I don't have any money, maybe I'll live here."
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy of that country in the United Kingdom, where Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan is visiting.
The Head of Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Vice-Premier Nick Klegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan & apos; s relations with India, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister reported that dialogue with the Taliban had begun," as stated in the statement of the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
He said that he hoped and prayed that dialogue would work in accordance with Pakistan's Constitution, "the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (techrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of a single-name Afghan movement, but operate independently in the north-west of the country along the border with Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
The Government of Islamabad had previously attempted to start negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement had refused to engage in dialogue.
It stated that it would only negotiate if the authorities took to the permanent locations the troops deployed in the Taliban areas and released them from the prisons of the arrested Islamists.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell at $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about large stocks were overshadowed by a message showing that China & apos; s energy-intensive production sector was gaining momentum.
The United States reference oil in December was cheap at 14 cents, at a price of $96.24 per barrel later in the morning for European time in e-bidding at the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract was cost-effective by 39 cents, a fall of 5.8 per cent for October.
The rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy stated on Wednesday that US reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels over the last week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels were replenished.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, based on two reports of Chinese industry that showed a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China & apos; s economic recovery can continue to grow after growth in the third quarter rose to 7.8 per cent after the 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Brent, a reference class of international oil used also by the United States refineries, has cost 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
The Chief Coach, "Colorado", Patrick Rue, explaining the decision to release the Golkiper, Semena Varlamov, from the first minutes of the Friday match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars had not slammed his confidence in the Russian, and transferred from Dallas a "SE" colokore to Natalia Schmelev.
And what are we waiting for, Rue said after the morning's "Lavin" roll?
Of course, what happened is a matter of concern to us all, but we are sure of it and we feel that it will be useful for him to go out on ice today.
We want him to go out on ice and show him his usual level.
So you're fully sure the situation has not affected the doctor's condition?
We'll see about that today.
Undoubtedly, our players will support Varley in helping him protect the gate, as was the case in the previous games of this season.
The point is, no one on the team is going to make any conclusions until this situation is resolved.
In Siberia, you don't have to be a vegan: a warm tomato won't replace a soup.
Why a vegetarian is not fit for life in Siberia, finding out a RIA News correspondent.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here, they can't take the winter without a loss of health, and no warm tomatoes will compensate them, as the newcomers and doctors interviewed on the eve of the Vegan Day believe.
Pour oil with lime.
Strict vegetarian activity, when not only meat and fish are abandoned, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, diet doctors are convinced that in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia, it is not at least healthy to adhere to such strict nutritional standards.
The total elimination of animal products is harmful.
Animals of proteins contain indispensable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for by plant.
You have to include at least milk or eggs in the diet, "I'm sure the dietologist Marina Bogai.
It gives an example of fish containing the indispensable fat acid of Omega-3.
The richest vegetable oil they have is linen.
"To use it in the quantities necessary for a man, you have to drink a lime!" says the dietologist.
The medical community is convinced that the Siberians need special attention in the winter.
In this season, vegetarian activity is particularly called into question.
In our realities, there are high food requirements.
To keep it cold, you need a high calorie.
"If a man limits himself to animal products, therefore he does not take this calorie," says the specialist.
The Oleg Sasnjak Dietologist agrees with that.
She adds that the vegetables and fruit are not a solution.
It is better for a person to eat mainly of products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is designed to better absorb and process these products.
And in the winter, people don't want to chew a cucumber, but a hot soup or something, "the doctor explains his position.
According to her, what can be vegan is really useful for different crops, large, bean, local vegetables, apples remaining in winter, frozen berries.
But that is certainly not enough for full food.
According to a gastroenterologist, Claudia Arifulina, only from mid-August to mid-September is the vitamin level of the anthrax.
A complete transition to vegetarian activity under our severe natural conditions, where temperature can change by 30 degrees in a day and snow is not appropriate in May.
The body needs energy for life, which is, above all, fat, "a medical examiner.
The doctors note that vagrancy is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children are growing up, they need building material, including amino acid.
And by being vegetarian, we give them to the poor.
Pregnant people also need increased protein, vitamin and micronutrient content on the menu.
"The Vegans don't get 'em," I'm sure.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, "play the toys he wants."
He has an already formed body, a skeleton, organs.
And the children still have to eat well.
If his parents take away some micronutrients or amino acid by choosing what he will eat for him, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of substances to develop the brain, the vision, the bones will no longer be restored tomorrow," she said.
All medical professionals interviewed agree on the low quality of the winter-grown in the warmth and in the delivery of vegetables and fruit.
What is also brought to us in the heat contains less micronutrients than (expressed) in the open ground.
"The quality of the products is not the same," says God.
Arifulina also notes that imported and warm vegetables and fruit are far from perfect standards.
Sometimes, the willingness of producers to harvest more is detrimental to quality.
"Apples do not become brown on a cut, cucumbers quickly yolk and play, tomatoes are tasty and unaromatic," provides examples of medics, adding that they are likely to be drunk with too much fertilizer.
And they become suppliers of cells, not vitamins.
This is not in agreement with the authority of the Siberian Institute of Physical and Technical Affairs of Agrarian Affairs, a candidate of the rural sciences of Vera Petruc.
She said that, with the right approach and compliance with all standards and requirements in the heat, it was possible to grow complete vegetables.
If they try to take more from a square metre, they will, of course, become more frequent, and they will refeed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes are growing rapidly, they are large but watertight and unpleasant, "she adds that the issue of quality is primarily a matter of the conscience of the manufacturer.
The Court suspended the implementation of the "stop-and-search" decision in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended the enforcement of a court order requiring changes in the "stop-and-search" programme of the New York Police Department and suspended the judge from the case.
The Court of Appeal of the Second U.S. District stated that the execution of Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended pending the outcome of an appeal filed by the city.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution in the manner in which he had carried out the street detention and interrogation programme.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and decisions on corrective measures, including an order to appoint an inspector to help the police to change their working practices and related training.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the parties & apos; debate on the application for a stay of the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that it was necessary to challenge the judge because she had violated the U.S. Code of Conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid being biased, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the criticism of the court.
The judge found that the police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unjustifiably addressing black and Latin American under the "stop-and-search" programme.
It had appointed an external monitor to monitor major changes that included policy, training and monitoring reforms, and had also decided to launch a pilot programme to test body-mounted video cameras at police stations where most detentions took place.
In August, New York decided to stop keeping the names and addresses of people who had been dismissed after a police check.
The city's appeal debate is due to take place after 14 March 2014.
The "stop and search" tactics were criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
The "stop-and-search" has been in some form for several decades, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor, Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of whom are black and Latin.
In 2004, four persons, all members of national minorities, filed a collective action with the courts.
The proponents of the change in the stop-and-search programme in the New York Police Department say that these changes will put an end to bad practices, create a more reliable and effective police service and can influence the way other police departments implement these practices.
The opponents claim that changes will reduce police morale rather than crime, lead to unnecessary spending of money and do not address the more global problem of difficult police conditions due to a reduction in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not stop the practice of "stop-and-search," which was in line with the Constitution, but changed the way in which the New York Police stopped people.
In the area of the Tremakovskaya Gallery, a pedestrian zone was opened
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Treyakovskaya Gallery and covers a area two kilometres from the Novoskunetskaya subway station to the Bologna Square.
All over the world, street torches, flowers, poles, urns and toilets have been set up, and deaf fences and illegal advertising have been removed.
In addition to the Klimentovsky and Lavrushin alleys, which were already pedestrians, five streets have been closed for the vehicles: the Ordina impasse, the Grand and Lesser Tolmachev Crossings, the Kadashev Coast and the Bologna.
The traffic on Maroseik and Petzka streets is not limited.
On Friday Street, from the lobby of the Novoskusneckaya station to the Clicentovsky alley, pedestrian conditions have been created without movement being removed and the carriageway cut, and is being passed on to newsmsk.com.
Within the pedestrian zone, the third yakov gallery, the temple of the holy martyr Clement of the Pope, the museums, libraries, monuments and other features were found.
In the past, the Tver Passage, the Stolestones of the alley and the Kuznetsk Bridge have become completely pedestrian.
The large Dmitzka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, decided to close for vehicles on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used the phone entry to check the confidential message.
The former editor of News of the World Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone break-in, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm the false information about Charles Clark's novel, who was then Minister of the Interior.
The Prosecutor, Royal Counsel Andrew Edis, informed the Court of Old Bailey that in May 2005, the News of the World had received inaccurate news that Clark was meeting with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The newspaper instructed private Detective Glenn Mulcair to break into Polby's voicemail and set her up at the house to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages, "heard the court.
"The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand by someone's house, hoping to be taken by surprise, he is the man who likes to offer history to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He said that News of the World had used three ways of investigating stories: phone break-in, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, about the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone break-in?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
The rumor of Clark's novel first attracted attention to News of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
A cassette with voice messages received from her phone at least three times was removed from Mulkeir's house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on a private detective's computer, where Ms. Polby and her sister were listed as "Projects."
During the period of her surveillance, Ms. Polby & apos; s grandmother and grandfather received anonymous calls requesting information about her, Mr. Edis said.
At that time, former Chief Reporter Neville Turlback and former reporter James Wezerup were monitoring Ms. Polby's movements.
By leaving her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we are planning to publish tomorrow and which I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edis said that Coulson's involvement in this history was based on the same scenario as with other influential people, such as former Minister of the Interior, David Blanket.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had engaged in a confrontation with Mr. Blanket about the affair with a married woman while he was meeting with the co-defendant, Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks deny collusion with other people to break phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkeir, Turlbeck and Wezerup confessed to breaking into their phones.
Snodeen states that he is ready to speak with the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany on the wire case.
An ex-CIA officer, Edward Snowden, is ready to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so and to meet with the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany, and is transmitting RIA News.
A letter from a former CIA officer to the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany, at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday, was presented by a member of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele, through which Snodeen transmitted a message to the German authorities.
He met with Snowden in Moscow the day before.
Four people were injured in a fire on Tver Street
Four passers were injured as a result of fire in a reservoir in central Moscow, on Tver Street.
According to Interfax, with reference to the source in the emergency services, one of the victims has been hospitalized.
According to the source, passers were affected during a fire at a smoked underground crossing.
As RIA News has written with reference to the Head of the Capital Department of Fuel and Energy, Pavel Livinsky, electricity is now fully restored in all houses on Tver Street.
A fire in a heat collector near 15 Tver Street took place on the evening of October 31.
There was a strong smoke from the storm sewers, and an underground crossing near the "Armenia" store created smoke.
The fire destroyed 11 houses on Tver Street.
At 21: 45 Moscow time, the fire was eliminated.
The US is cutting the food allowance for the poor
The four-person family food allowance is reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday in the United States, financial support for food stamps known as "foodstempes" has been reduced, as the relevant government programme ends.
The four-person family will now be allocated $36 a month less than before, according to officials.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, an average of $133 per person per month in fiscal year 2012.
Food aid expenditure in the United States has increased to $80 billion per year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14 per cent of Americans rely on free food aid from the "foodstemps" that have been named since they were paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans in Congress demand further reductions in the resources allocated to the programme, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need it most.
Food shop owners all over America are concerned that cuts will reduce consumer spending.
US Congressmen continue to argue about how to further reduce government funding.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platter free of charge.
The Blizzard studio released its 1994 Blackthorne platform on the PC free of charge.
This is reported by the World Insider.
According to his data, the game was made available in the Battle.net section of the classic Blizzard games.
However, some gamers note that only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can download it at present.
The game is also not available to Russian users.
According to the media, the version Blizzard has now released on the PC is no different from the original version of the game.
The Blackthorne soundtrack also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
His events were spread on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and light kingdom.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the Light King of Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight with Sarlak's men and protect the people of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game to be released by the studio after being renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was published by Interplay.
The Moscow metropolis will have new machine guns.
But they're not gonna sell tickets to the passengers for money, they're gonna be for the sedatives.
One trip at a cost of 30 roubles would cost a potential passenger at 30 seats.
The number of seats will count a special device using modern technologies, and reports to ITAR-TASS with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first machine will be installed at the Exhibition Station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of the new tickets, the President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zukov, and the Olympic Champions of the Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamolotykova will be present.
The recognition of the National Security Agency increases the paranoia of corporations with regard to State surveillance
In late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
According to the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, his mission was to take a picture of the roof of the United States Mission building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media say that BfV was hoping to find the antenna of listening devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the United States and the German Foreign Office in Berlin.
James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, again in September, assured that the US did not use external intelligence "to steal foreign commercial secrets for the benefit of United States companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who became a decoy, started publishing his treasure of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company leaders are no longer sure if the director can be trusted.
Reports that the United States National Security Agency was monitoring the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by United States cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised the paranoia of corporations caused by the State's surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been auditioning for, like, 10 years.
If Europe's most powerful persona can be a target, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made it clear that there is intensive cooperation between the US intelligence services and the companies.
I think it is likely that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany has to wake up," said Oliver Grun, the president of BITMI, who represents Germany's small and medium IT company.
German companies are convinced that the US now presents almost the same risk as China in the area of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published by the EY consulting agency in July.
In all of Mr. Snowden's documents, however, there was still no evidence that the US had transferred the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked some capacity in information technology and the Internet and suggested that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are skeptical about it.
Someone in the German Parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"It's not an option," says Gasso Platner, the president of a German software company for SAP business.
If there was a need for a strong European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
All are subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
And yet the scope and technical development of the US espionage agencies, which were known by Snowden's revelations, was a shock to some companies that used to think that China had the greatest risk of surveillance.
A major shift is taking place in cloud technologies, where European company leaders have better realized that data stored in the US are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study by Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants have abandoned plans to use the United States-based cloud provider's services after the United States program was exposed for the intellectual analysis of Prism's data.
Jim Snebe, one of the executive directors of SAP, said, "We see consumers asking a new question that didn't come up a year ago, namely, where my data are stored and if you can guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction."
Many German leaders claim that recent reports are merely evidence of what they already knew: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data should be protected at all costs.
What's going on with economic espionage is not surprising.
He's always been.
"This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate," says Kurt Bok, the chief executive of the chemical company BASF.
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial levels, and we spy on them, too, because it is in our national interest to protect our business.
Corporate leaders generally do not like to brag about the response they have taken, as this may give the enemy an advantage.
In large companies, it has long been understood that taking a free drive at the exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room is at least uncautious.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the Audi Automotive Company, said that it had been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they could not be used as listening devices.
The Federal Office for the Protection of the German Constitution recommends that company leaders consider the use of simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
The pre-paid mobile phones are subsequently released.
Nevertheless, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to break-in and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their specific niche.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access," the BfV report warns.
The US is warning its own companies of economic espionage from other countries.
In February, the United States National Intelligence Report placed France, together with Russia and Israel, on the second set of economic intelligence hackers after China, claiming The Washington Post.
A member of the Board of Directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that, in the case of economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: "The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
The parents of a young man from Georgia who died by "ridiculous accident" think their son was killed.
The parents of a young man from Georgia, whose body was found inside a broken sports mother in his high school sports room, believe that their son was killed, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Waldosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertically standing mata, attached back to the podium in his high school sports room.
The Loundes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but that the family of a 17-year-old is challenging it.
"They are absolutely sure that their son was killed," said FoxNews.com Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff says.
"They think it's contrary to logic, the laws of physics, and common sense," said Kramp.
They think it's a cover to protect the man or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a body bag," he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What caused death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll look into all the facts, wherever they go.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds" for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told the reporters that the initial autopsy showed that Johnson died as a result of "position asphyxiation."
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
"There are a few questions that should be resolved or clarified," he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to require a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
A representative of the Loundes County Sheriff & apos; s Office was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
Judge South Georgia ordered the authorities on Wednesday to publish all the video of the security cameras that the investigators had seen.
The teenage parents said they were hoping that the video contained a key to how he died.
"Spartacus": For information on persons who put out a fascist symbol
On the official site of Spartacus, a statement was made by the Moscow club about the presence of a fascist flag at the Yaroslave rostrum.
On October 30, at the "Shinnik" Cup match, "Spartacus," unknown provocators at the Yaroslava Stadium showed a fascist symbol.
We request that all those who have reliable information about the perpetrators of this criminal offence be provided with such information.
"The reward is guaranteed," said in the statement.
Looking for the fans who put out the fascist flag in Yaroslava.
We will recall that in match 1 / 16, the Russian Cup of "Shinnik" - "Spartacus" was interrupted several times because of the riots at the podium.
A fascist symbol was also shown in the Spartacus sector.
Spartacus's punishment can be about three games without the audience.
There will be a meeting of the committee on Friday.
If you have any information on who put that symbol in and out, please contact us.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued recommendations to schools on child allergies
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations that the US government has issued, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has food allergies.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children had increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The manual provides information to schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and service staff about food allergies among children and how to assist in the event of an allergic response.
It also recommends that schools maintain adrenaline stocks - most often for injections, an automatic EpiPen medical syringe - to help with potentially lethal anaphylaxis.
The state legislatures have recently amended the regulations to allow schools to make more difficult adrenaline supplies.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have an allergic response.
Children can say, "It's like something's in my tongue," "it's like I have hair in my language," or "the tongue of a snitch."
The parents of intersex children can choose "undetermined sex."
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with an external sex body of an intermediate type.
The new ones will no longer be required to attribute the male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any sex of such children, allowing parents to indicate sex as "uncertain" or "undefined" in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the Act was to remove pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions about the operation of sexual mutilation of newborns and to combat discrimination against intersex persons.
One intersex man, according to the BBC, said many years later, "I'm not a man or a woman."
I'm gonna be a doctor-created lopsided product with bruises and scars.
One of the 2,000 children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersex, one of the approximately 60 pathological states that are diagnosed as "sexual abuse," a collective term for people with anemic chromosomes, gonadis (eggs or seeds) or unusually developed outside sexual organs.
Wallace Simpson may have been an intersex.
Gender identification is still not sufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use and assign all available information than to wait and monitor the child & apos; s psychological and physical development before the operation, if any.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Dresker, who specializes in gender identification, said that the new German law "sounds like a good idea."
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening violations that require rapid intervention, but most children do not," he said.
You can decorate the floor without surgery and then see how the identity develops.
The science about how a child's gender identity is established is not very accurate.
No one can answer the questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transgender or transgender persons, since their condition was not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which was not exclusively male or female, but was typical of both at the same time or was not specific to either.
These characteristics can be found in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and body composition; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or chromosomes and hormone structure.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the field of employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice.
The boys with gender-sensitive disabilities now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to place male, female or "third sex" in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old resident of Australia, Norrie May-Welby, was the first person in the world to be recognized as "no-sex," with the right to maintain "undetermined" sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third symbol in addition to M and F-X, that is, intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators, this well-known Catholic country, signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also expressed its opposition to German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is brought into a new state where sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we turn two more pillars of civilization."
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have children set sex at birth.
"It's hard enough to raise a child without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she said the parents' website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born to male and female sex organs were called hermaphrodists, by the name of a beautiful Greek God, who had both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community took the gender as a list that could be erased and then repainted.
But now many are challenging the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how a child will take the sex assigned to him when he grows up.
"In the mid-twentieth century, it was called an" emergency psychiatric case, "said Dresker.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genitals was suggested by Dr. John Mani of Jones Hopkins University, who believed that the gender was easy to change.
He introduced the term "gender identity" and argued that environmental signals, including social signals - how parents raise a child - were working with the genome and hormone of the child to determine whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as "John / Joan," his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged during a negligent circumcision, to fully castrate the child, also removing his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of a transition, but it was not," said Dresher.
When the boy was about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresker said some doctors are still "using this model."
But in the 1990s, with the Internet coming, the people who have been through these sex-change operations said they were "dissatisfied with the result."
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with the XY male chromosomes, but with intermediate genitals.
The doctors could not determine whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a man's "full life."
As a result, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce & apos; s external sexual organ and testicles were mechanically removed and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said ABCNews.com. p.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was assigned vaginoplastic.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he required medical documentation.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a violation of sexual development, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for the normal development of genitals.
When he found out the truth, he became a man again, receiving the injections of testosterone and removing his chest.
The surgery made it sterile.
Today, he is defending others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to make people with intersex feel normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, the executive director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "encourages labels and styma."
"Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an" undetermined sex, "she said.
We are afraid that he will facilitate intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will show itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to make a third-sex choice."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sex," she said.
The German law implies its attribution at birth.
It is a battle that little children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Barac, a mammalog X-ray scientist from Pittsburgh, who had a daughter with a sexual background and who helped hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law would "support" both parents and children.
Barac's daughter, Cathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development violation called "total insensitivity to androgens."
Because her androgenic receptors are not working properly, Katie's female signs have developed.
She's got a vagina, but she's got no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Cathy is married and is in a residence in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she was barren, she hoped to be a parent through adoption or a gestational surrogate.
"The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own," said Barac.
It gives them time to do some tests and to understand the situation, as well as a period of time before they write "male" or "female."
In that case, you're all right, raise a child, love a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel happy.
We don't need to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
"This allows children to participate in the decision and removes the excitement that the parents are driving because they don't feel right," she said.
After all, the child will decide which sex is more comfortable with him or her, and that's great.
This gives children the opportunity to make decisions on their own.
The Chicago Gate, Nikolai Habibulin, stressed that he understood that he had to play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard at training.
In the last two Hawk meetings, Habibulin first missed six of the Tampa Bay and then four of the Ottawa, and in the second game it was replaced after the fourth missing Seib.
We have to play well, and in the last two games, I failed, which is what the KSNChicago says.
- I need to find some confidence in the training, maybe we should approach them as games, and try to achieve a better result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training, I feel pretty good.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snow.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
I don't think I'm the only one who's always trying to make the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not happy.
It doesn't matter what happens before my gate.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss so many beads.
It's great that my classmates support, but in principle, it's simple: I have to play better.
Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to spend a lot better.
But what happened was what happened.
I have to put it aside.
I'm just gonna try to play the next match better.
On Altai, the bus overturned.
In the Rubtsov district of Altai province, a PAZ bus turned over.
As a result of the accident, 13 persons were reported to have been injured and reported to the Regional Office of the MPS.
The law enforcement agencies in the region had previously reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident occurred about 9 a.m. local time on the road Novonikilayevka-Vishnieka, 1 km from Novonicolyevka.
The bus from Rubzovsk to Vishnjek contained 12 passengers and a driver, all of whom were injured by various degrees of gravity and were hospitalized.
Eleven of the victims were taken to Rubtsovska City Hospital No. 1 and two were hospitalized in Rubtsovska CRB.
Medvedev expects a SSJ-100 to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that, once established in the markets of Latin America and Asia, Superjet 100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe as well.
"We expect a total of more than 170 copies of this type of aircraft to receive such arrangements," the Interfax refers to the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, which he said at a press conference with France's premier Jean-Marc Eiro.
The Head of the Russian Government noted that there had been serious cooperation with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some of the financial issues that are related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in Latin American and Asia-Pacific markets, it will also be provided to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will ever be submitted to France," stressed the Russian Prime Minister.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by the Civil Aviation Company, in partnership with Alenia Armacchi.
Lioner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high quality and comfort standards in a segment of 100 passengers.
The energy of the Dnipropetrovs has started a unique program to save... the Aist nest.
In an old man, the villagers on a high pole set up a wheel from a cart, and a heavy nest was well held.
It's been a long time since these special pillars have been put on, so the aists have been looking at the pillars of the transmission lines - the intertwined branches are based on the wire, so the aism house is worth it.
Aunha's grandmother, who has been living in the village of Ivanovka in the Petrikovsky region for 20 years, has seen the nest settle, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds are putting new ropes on the top, and the bottom layer is already in between the wires, and it's about to fall.
Of course, it's a pity for a family of aists who were angry every year at the cellar, took out and fed for the summer of three or four girls, but don't want to be left without light.
As soon as the birds went to the warm edges, Anya's grandmother called the Tsarican REC, to which the support belongs.
I didn't even expect them to react so quickly.
When our experts arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, as the technical director of the DTAC, "Dneoplyenergy," Sergey Berezovsky, said.
Corrosion began on the wires, which were in fact already inside the nest, weighing between 150 and 200 kilograms.
At any time, birds could have died from an electrical grade.
And the local people were at risk of being out of light because of the damage to the wires.
So line monsters have started a nest rescue operation, not for the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from the Dnipropetrovsk National University helped to develop a scheme for the transfer of the nest.
They did training for district network staff.
Alexander Ponomarenko, a well-known Dnipropetrovsky ornitologist, advised energy workers at all stages of the reconstruction of the nests.
For the first time, it was estimated that more than 50 anistic "apartments" were in the area of emergency.
Special metal platforms that resemble the gate were welded for their reconstruction.
The base was swollen by the eyebrows and then carried the old nest there.
In the opinion of the chiefs, it is enough to lay old branches as a basis for birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
After that, the aists will complete their own home.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanca, Novomoskov district.
A new iron-concrete pillar was set up near the electric base and a platform with an old, already-ingested nest was placed on it.
The whole operation cost the energy to the nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day, the same housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka, Petritkovskaya district, in the basement of Ani's grandmother.
This is where the platform was fixed in the same place, just over the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has been overhauled.
The same reconstruction is expected by the end of the year for four more nests in the Poblovsky and Tsarican regions of Dnipropetrovna.
By the way, while some are saving rare birds, others are ruthless.
The other day, the whole region was slandered by a sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenk of the Apostolovsky district, on the day of the opening of the pheasant hunt, the poachers shot at a left-wing family living on a local pond for entertainment.
The noble birds were not afraid of people at all. The local people fed them and did not hurt them.
When the villagers heard the shots, they ran to the pond, and the four beautiful swan were already lying on the water dead.
Now, the officers of the Apostolov District of the Police are finding out who shot the birds in the Red Book.
The Russian march is getting more popular.
On November 4, the Day of People's Unity, Moscow will be held in agreement with the mayor of the Russian march.
According to the Levada Centre survey, support for the Russian Marches is growing, with 40 per cent of the citizens having given a different degree of approval.
According to the Levada Centre, 40 per cent of citizens are in different degrees of approval of the "Russian Marches," of which 11 per cent are clearly positive and 29 per cent are "rather positive."
The popularity of the idea of "Russian Marches" is gradually increasing, with only 14 per cent of Russians welcomed these acts in 2006, and more than twice as many (28 per cent) supported such activities in December 2010.
The "definitely negative" of the "Russian Marshals" is only 7 per cent of the Russians, and "rather negative" is 19 per cent.
Another 35 per cent had not been able to formulate their attitude towards the action.
This year, the Moscow City agreed to a "Russian march" of up to 15,000 people in Lublino, which was reported today by the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Mayorov.
This national action has been held every year on People & apos; s Unity Day since 2005.
On the question of sociologists, "Have you heard that on 4 November, the Russian marches are held in Russia under the slogan of protecting the rights of Russians in Russia?" three quarters (75 per cent) of the citizens responded in a negative manner.
Only one in five Russians (20 per cent) are now aware of this action.
It is noteworthy that, in December 2010, almost one third of the citizens (31 per cent) were heard of the Russian Marches.
We will recall that three years ago, on 11 December, a natural meeting of nationalists took place in Manet Square, which became a mass unrest.
The Levada Centre also asked the Russians about the celebration on 4 November.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (Day of National Unity) increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
At the same time, only 15 per cent of citizens are going to celebrate the holiday.
The same (17 per cent) is intended to celebrate the October Revolution Day on 7 November.
Most citizens (62 per cent) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
As the city of Moscow agreed on a Russian march in Lublino.
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to a "Russian march" on 4 November in Lublino.
This was reported by the leader of the Russian association, the organizer of the march Dmitri Demuszkin.
In addition to the Lublino march, the People's Unity Day will be a meeting and a rock concert of the Colorat group, also agreed with the authorities.
How was the Russian March 2012?
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, the nationalists moved from the Yakiman Coast to the Central House of the painter, where the meeting took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants at 20,000, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs referred to the number of 6,000
Communication: Obama's pre-election headquarters considered the exclusion of Biden in favour of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's next advisers were secretly considering the possibility of replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
This discovery is the most vivid sensation of all the expected book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 campaign "The stakes are double: The game has changed 2012."
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the next presidential assistants had carried out "extensive focus group research and public opinion polls at the end of 2011" to assess whether the exclusion of Baiden could help raise the flimsy hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to the political observer, The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by high-level officials of the electoral headquarters and the White House, namely the former head of the White House administration, Bill Daley, to assess the impact of former Secretary of State Clinton's appointment on the vote.
The possible replacement was a secret, well-protected, at the Chicago electoral headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the President's closest advisers - including Daley, the former head of Obama's electoral headquarters, Jim Messin, and former senior advisers of the White House, David Axelrod and David Pluff - knew that the replacement was being considered.
The book "The rates are double" states that Daley was the proponent of an attempt to replace Baiden despite their "close personal relationship," but eventually abandoned this step when their data showed that the Clinton electoral list would not "significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the Administration had indeed considered the possibility of replacing Biden Clinton.
"I have been actively advocating for consideration of a lot of things, and it was one of them," said Daley to the paper.
You have to remember that the President was in a terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, my God, what are we gonna do?"
Although Daley described the study as "necessary verification," Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that the electoral headquarters had invested enough in examining whether that step would bring dividends to the vote.
"The election headquarters do not spend such sums of money on interviews and focus groups if they do not consider anything serious," said Martin in the AK 360 program.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was exploring the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about a possible transfer.
Although Daley said he didn't think the president was "aware" of a possible replacement, former head of administration admitted that "maybe" Obama knew.
Martin added that "The rates are double" did not provide a clear answer to the question whether the results of political examination had reached Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama was not aware of the study on the possibility of removing Biden from the electoral list.
"Maybe," Martin said.
Do you want a light in the dark ice cream?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first dark ice cream with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop a glowing food.
He came to this idea by reading a scientific article on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically re-create a glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the language of the one who eats it, raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that since the ice cream starts to shine when it responds to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company, "Lise me, I'm good," says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still at the very beginning, in terms of production, so for £200, you get about 2 g of substance."
The protein we use in the ice cream reacts with your language with neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will start to shine.
We've been testing it over the last few months, and it seems perfect to introduce it to Halloween because it's creating such a great luminous effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever done, because the luminess of the jellyfish is four times the value of gold.
So every balloon costs me about $140.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie's pilot company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual taste, including beer, cheese, beef and dried gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
It's not possible by definition because of the refractions caused by the ice crystals, which make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists.
The "Avangarda" coach, Vladimir Chebaturkin, in preparing his team for the KHL regular championship against "Salawat," noted that the omychi had conducted a thorough analysis of the damage from the "Metallurga" magnettogoric.
The specialist stressed that Avangarda needs to pay more attention to the defense game.
We've seen a video game against the Mentallurga, which is the official website "Avangarda" of Chebaturkin's word.
- We missed a lot of shakes, not a very nice moment.
They did it because of their mistakes, because they didn't do it.
We knew that the rival had performers.
According to the statistics, they had five attacks on the way, three of us got hit.
Very good implementation.
Those mistakes were taken into account in the preparations for today's game?
The guys and I are going through every game carefully, talking after the game, preparing for a new rival.
The main thing is that the installation is to be carried out.
Everyone saw the first period of the game against "Metallurg."
The game was performed, and the account was 2: 0.
They let the goal "in the locker room" go, and in the third period, they started to make mistakes.
Given how hard it was to play, I didn't see the point of engaging the defence.
The whole team has to fight.
Now the Avangard has a long home series, and the games are going on in a day, and the team is getting tired?
All teams are under the same conditions.
The main thing now is to realize your moments and perform a game mission.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you do the installation, it's not that hard to solve.
Because of the new rules introduced by the Russian Customs, hundreds of pounds have been in line on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, the government officials promised to provide the drivers with drinking water and to set up the biotoualets.
At the border points, hundreds of fours were accumulated at the time of entry into Russia.
This situation is due to a change in the rules on the handling of goods.
The Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that the turn is being made by the Russian side, which did not advance the news.
On 28 October, the Russian Customs authorities introduced additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, as reported by the Deputy Chief of Eastern Customs, Vladimir Denisov.
The new model is applied in countries that have acceded to the International Transport Convention.
The entry points shall be operated in a high mode.
FAKTOV's correspondent visited the border and spoke with long-range fighters who had been held hostage.
The prices at the road shop at the Novoazovsk pass point are growing every day, as are the line of the Fur.
The trucks are in several rows, stretching about two kilometres.
The Customs Terminal of Novoazovsk-Veselo-Ascenjenica provides one of the most important transport routes from southern Ukraine on the international highway.
This is where the goods are sent to the Stavropol province of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Armenia.
On Sunday before midnight, and after the introduction of the regulations, there was a complaint by a long-distance fighter, Alexei Golovanev (in a photo), who was in transit through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and had been in his car for almost a week.
According to the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and the payment of cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance to which they are carried.
The minimum insurance is between 4.5 and 5,000 rubles (about 1,100 to 1,300 hryvnias).
Those who go near (say, Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo value of up to $50,000 pay about 15,000 rubles (3,800 hryvnias) and travel.
And the others are stuck because no one has that much money with them.
You can imagine if a driver takes a load of only $4,000, but to Moscow, he needs 90,000 roubles (almost 23,000 hryvnias) to pay for transit!
The condition for survival at the border is no, there are long-distance fighters who are able to eat near their cars.
In border shops and cafes, it's always expensive, but we've never met a price like this.
The salesmen were guided and quickly raised: 15 grinders are worth a baton, seven grinders are a cup of coffee, and 25 greens are a bowl of soup.
And the cafeteria is alone.
And there's no bathroom.
In the steppe, we go to the bathroom.
No washing, no shave...
I can stay out of the car for a week, and my wife made it all up.
I will last a week, and I will be comforted by another long-distance fighter, Victor Skotarenko.
Just will my car get a turn in a week?
Why do you have one and a half liters of water?
There are 11 and 15 hryvnas.
What, is a bottle of crystal or is water hard on silver?
We have a coffee shop, not a shop.
You take it while there's something else, the salesman parishes.
After the situation began to be reported in the media, the plight of Ukrainian drivers was brought to the attention of the authorities of the region.
The authorities of the Amvrosiev and Novoazov regions were instructed to provide drinking water to all those in line on the Ukrainian-Russian border, as stated by the Acting President of the Donetsk Ministry of the Interior, Sergei Dergunov.
Emergency teams are now on duty at the entry points.
Biotoualets will also be installed for human convenience.
According to the official, the problem of priorities will be resolved in the coming days.
According to the press service of Donetsk, as at 31 October, 32 and 68 vehicles were present at the international points of the Uspenka and Novoazovsk passes, respectively.
The FACTS will monitor the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian President.
The Russian Federation intends to carry out information provocations against high-level citizens of Lithuania and the countries of the Eastern Partnership, a statement that was made by the BNS agency in the State Security Department of the Republic (DSB).
This information is published on the DELFI portal.
In particular, it is reported that Moscow is going to "talk" to the President of Lithuania, Dal Gribauskaite, and to publish the falsified documents allegedly found in Russian Gosarhiv, which relate to facts from the curriculum vitae of the Lithuanian leader.
According to data from the Special Service, an information attack is being prepared by the Department for the Analysis of Social Processes of the Administration of the President & apos; s Administration on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who has visited Lithuania on several occasions and participated in the Congress of the People & apos; s Party of Lithuania.
A staff member of the Department of V. Smirnov is also alleged to be involved in the operation.
According to the Special Service, Smirnov, under the cover of scientific work, had been regularly in Lithuania until the end of 2012 and had been in contact with local politicians, political and media representatives.
Smirnovu is now prohibited from entering the country.
The day before, President Gribauskait of Lithuania announced that he was aware of the information that was being prepared for her.
In her view, the main reasons were Lithuania's successful presidency of the Council of the European Union and "the country's desire for energy independence."
The Lithuanian leader has previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
Thus, she stated that in the Kremlin, Lithuania was "not sufficiently respected."
In addition, Gribauskait accused the head of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, of making "just claims" to Lithuania.
In September, in September, Rosuzuznadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian "milk" into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the products was not in accordance with health and epidemiological standards.
At that time, the leader of Lithuania stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the Government of Lithuania should prepare an application to the WTO.
In the United States, the school director shot at a young man.
The directors of an American high school were literally desperate.
A man, he said, had to take a gun and start shooting.
The incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, young bullies threw toilet paper at a man's house.
As a result, the school director opened fire on young people, resulting in several injuries to the leg and arm by a 15-year-old boy.
As the bullies were not in the property of the director, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released on bail at $125,000.
We note that shooting at civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in the centre of Ridgecross in the U.S. state of California, right down the street.
The perpetrator then took two random passers hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Previously, a shooting was opened at Newtown Elementary School, Connecticut.
Adam's mother worked at school, she was an educator.
Shot at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident took place on 31 January at the American school, this time in Anlante, Georgia.
Two people were affected: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, not to sleep late and have a masquerade for our neighborhood.
Now I look more like a rag.
I haven't called in the last two years to give out candy in my apartment, and I probably won't be this year.
However, statistics show that I'm a white crow about Halloween.
According to the National Retail Trade Federation, most Americans - 158 million - will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, suits and jewelry.
The only thing I expect every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Trade Federation is projecting $1.2 billion out of $6.9 billion spent on suits.
This year, there are sexual, inanimated objects on the peak of fashion.
Women no longer have to be sex women; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we'll see a lot of zombies thanks to "Walking the Dead," and I'm sure the Daft Punk cosmonauts will be in our Instagram tape this year.
According to Google, the suits most commonly sought are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I think there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Trade Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on domestic animal suits.
That means a lot of funny hunting dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't change.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It is about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, lollipop, Milk Dudes candy, Twizzler chocolates and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million children who need candy, who are ready to subdue our areas.
In fact, we're gonna buy and - we're not gonna lie to ourselves - we're gonna eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is candy in the form of corn grains; yet, according to the National Actors Association, almost 35 million pounds are sold as Halloween.
It's about 9 billion separate corn grains.
It's a mystery I still have to figure out.
Nothing is as much about Halloween as at home with ghosts.
They have amazing names, such as "Terror behind the walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "War and Cry" and "The House of Shock."
Moreover, according to American Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized houses in America with ghosts that generate about $500 million in income, as well as those amazing photos where you almost described your friend put on Facebook, and you can't remove, and then the guy you like sees this picture and leaves a comment like "a cool face."
And in conclusion, we'll talk about the pumpkin.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and the cutting of Jack's candle is like a Christmas tree decoration, what we've been doing since we were kids.
Fortunately for us, the pumpkin fashion only started last year because of Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out these pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million per pumpkin this year.
Jack's light, slowly drying on your porch, probably came from the state of Illinois, which raised 542 million pounds this year.
If you want a better job, you can visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in the city of Napa, California, and try to cut something out of their pumpkin weight of 2032 pounds.
The Estonian Ministry of Defence site was restored after an attack by Ukrainian hackers
The site of the Ministry of Defence of Estonia has been re-established following the morning cyber attack and is reported to the press service of the Department.
According to the Vice-Chancellor of the Ministry of Information and Administration, Timar Petercop, it was a primitive attack, the site being overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists have quickly set up the site, and the site has now been reestablished.
"The damage to the Ministry is minimal," said Petercop to the Postimees publication.
According to Petercop, it's too early to talk about who organized the attacks.
"We will necessarily analyse the reasons for the incident and draw our conclusions from it, but it is not possible to prevent such incidents at all," he acknowledged.
Naponim, on 1 November, the Anonymous Ukraine group posted a message online in which it confirmed the hacker attack on the Estonian Minoborna site and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, that of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be NATO's servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need a NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be a slave to anyone.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
"Hands away from Ukraine," said in Anonymous's statement.
The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine had previously reported that the Marine Company of the Feodossian separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Corps would take part in the NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013 command and headquarters exercises.
Some schools and a hospital had to be closed because of a lack of clean force.
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of South Matadelland had to be closed because the students had been attacked by... goblins.
According to the local elder, the children had fallen into panic and it had not been possible to continue their studies.
The story of goblins can sound like a child's invention for a European, but in Africa, this is a very serious argument for school closure.
The grown-ups are also afraid of unclean power.
In the summer, for example, a hospital in Zimbabwe was closed because the medical staff were also attacked by goblins.
Launch of the Land Rover series
Inside are race seats and six-point safety-belts, as well as an internal communications system.
In addition, it is possible to obtain modernized brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between activities.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said, "The members of the Bowler Rally have changed."
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement, adventures and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer such a way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and believe that this format offers a new way to try the various disciplines of the Rally in Britain and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the Rally.
We were very pleased to develop the Defender Challenge car - it would be a really exciting championship.
In addition, Defender Challenge provides for one day in February for training and testing, as well as for participation in activities in the desert in North Africa and the Middle East.
The Russian security forces are not aware of the "Bratsk Circle" group - New news
This is written by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After the media reported that Leps had been placed on the control lists on suspicion of being a member of the Eurasian 'Bratsky Circle' criminal syndicate, we reviewed all the databases, but no such group was found," said the agency's interlocutor.
In his view, the dissemination of that information helped to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which was allegedly operating abroad.
As previously written by "NI," yesterday, the U.S. Treasury Department published on its website a list of alleged members of the "Bratsky Circle" criminal group.
A Russian singer, Grigory Lepps, was also named.
He's on the list like "Grisha," he was put out the other day.
They match the data of the popular Russian performer.
The exact name is Grigory Lepseuridze, the creative pseudonym, and the place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, an Uzbek citizen and another one from the former USSR whose nationality is not specified.
In the United States, it is certain that Grigory Lepps, who lives on the island of Phuket, was carrying money for the bandits at their request.
A picture of the singer is attached to this communication and all his data are given, which is correct.
In fact, Leps really just bought a house on Phuket.
The agency indicated that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
The blacklisting of the American Minphin would result in the freezing of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with him by persons living in the United States.
Leps' assistant, Maya Serikov, stated that no notice had been received of the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question whether it is the Grigory that everyone is talking about in connection with a US scandal."
All Leps know is media information.
There was no official notification to him, but I don't know if they are.
"And, of course, it's all funny, on the one hand, and on the other, amazing and unexpected," she said RIA News.
According to her, there is no Grigory Lepps on Phuket, but, according to the United States Minphin, he does have a house on the Thai island.
She stated that the Leps were now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news had caught him on a flight to the city of Blagoshensk.
Escaped on the field in the "Shinnick" match.
Some details of the identity of a fan who had fled into the field during the 1 / 16 match of the Russian Cup between the Yaroslav "Shinnick" and the Moscow "Spartacus" have become known.
As the head of the RFF, Arthur Grigorianz, said, referring to data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the winner is a moskwitz.
He's in custody right now.
"In addition, Grigoriac described how a fan managed to break into the field:" It turns out that this, we call him an audience, went to the ambulance, accompanied by two viewers, referring to heart problems.
He went to the ambulance, which was confirmed to us by the ambulance doctor.
And then he pushed two of the escorts away and ran to the field.
He fled from the corner of the Eastern and Southern Tribune to the corner of the Eastern and Northern Tribune.
He ran through the whole field.
The stewards are responsible.
Pending the entry into force of the Sports Act, this steward action zone - the police cannot interfere with what is on the field.
He ran to the podium, flew over the Eastern rostrum.
And at that time, riots began on the Eastern rostrum and on the runway, "the head of the KDC said.
We should like to recall that, by decision of the KDC, the Moscow "Spartacus" will hold the next round of the 15th Russian Championship against "Lokomotiv" and "Zenita" without the audience, as well as a fine of 600,000 roubles.
Fire teams were called to save a lost puppy who was stuck at 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous career assignment.
The poker-paniel Ruby ran away after he got into a little car accident.
Three days later, a man who was stuck in a career saw her walking a dog.
The firemen came down on a rope on the back slope to save the dog from imminent death.
The puppy was lucky to be saved after the fire teams were called up to take him up and take him to a safe place, after he was somehow stuck at 50 feet on a dangerous side of the back.
A nine-month-old poker spaniel Ruby ran away after a car accident on Sunday afternoon, and spent three days alone before being saved from his career on Wednesday.
Her owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at Flappit's career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were looking for their missing dog, and they were posting contacts on social media sites after she ran into the quarry after a small accident.
At about 2: 15 p.m. on Wednesday, a dog carrier spotted Ruby, who was stuck at a 50-foot high on a career assignment.
A technical rescue unit from the Klekheaton fire station rushed to the scene, went down on the ropes to save Ruby, and used a delivery to lift it up the slope.
Andy Clayton's rescue officer said, "She was in a dangerous situation."
It was right in the middle of the back slope, 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move the muscle during the rescue, she's completely cold.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that a dog has been noticed is incredible.
The rescue officer Peter Lau said, "Ruby is very lucky to have been saved."
There was a chance that she could have had a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for an inspection, and it was found that she was all right, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "It was scary to watch the rescue."
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The vet said that if she had been dissipated and unconscious, she would probably have fallen.
The firemen were great.
It was very brave, what they did.
We are so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson from the city of Kitley added, "We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there."
The firemen were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Katie Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio show this week, a pop star stated that she was a back singer for the 2004 Jagger song Old haves die hard.
Perry said he had dinner with a veteran roker, and he said, "He was playing with me when I was 18."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of Jagger, age 7, said that he "categorically denied that he had ever hit on Katie Perry."
The representative added: "Perhaps she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the artists who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, "Prism," debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: The break-up with Europe gives the Scots a choice.
One more day, another fear of independence.
This time we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition for EU membership.
There are stories about passport control in Bervik and the border with barbed wire along Adrianoval.
Indeed, Strathclyde has pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movement across the rest of Europe, although - what is predictable - it did not appear in the headlines.
No one also indicated that EU member countries were spending much time turning their formal rules in the way they were comfortable with it.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen zone, continuing non-compliance will be a cheap assignment for Brussels, instead of what it really wanted from the Scottish.
So it's a story that doesn't deserve attention.
And so old that she's become a fossil: for the first time, I heard a duck about "independence means passport control," at least 40 years ago.
And yet there's an interesting moment lost in the old story.
Why should independent Scotland even comply with European orders?
Why change the London Fair to the Brussels Fair, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unify Europe has finally stalled.
With the European crisis, the "Europe" project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposing the EU or in favour of the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining force.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptics Party "Alternative for Germany" - founded only this year - came out of nowhere and obtained almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus effectively removing the "Free Democrats" (the equivalent of our "Liberal Democrats") from Bundestag.
There was always an internal opposition to the federal European plan.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the chains imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency have led many people to believe that the "Europe" project has gone too far.
The euro crisis is little related to the fact that national Governments are working with excessive budget deficits, which is only true for Greece.
In fact, the European system has blocked its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters - which German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is in a pre-emptive disadvantage in terms of productive opportunities compared to Germany.
The only saving means is to cut wages and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
In addition to the current budget and currency problems, there is a deeper problem of Europe's productive capacities.
As a result of the green energy package introduced by Brussels - a code that means consumer subsidies for French and German energy companies - the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the US.
It's a paralyzed, unfavourable price environment, as we've seen in Granjmut.
No global wage freeze will stop the US cheap shale gas from winning over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, there is a riot, especially in France, once the most powerful supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France's devastated economy in distress.
The result is the right-wing party against the EU, the Marin Le Pen party, the National Front, just won the decisive additional elections by dropping the ruling socialist party to the third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British laborists that it cannot be assumed that the division among the right will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with his new popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If, and very likely, anti-EU parties are supported in these elections, such an assembly will be able to dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
This is my view: the rapidly growing mood against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will be brought together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become some sort of vague "Europe (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I believe that Britain is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get close to the US.
However, the growing interest of Washington in the Pacific indicates that it is likely that Britain will be left unaddressed in the cold of the Atlantic.
In what position does Scotland leave it?
We can choose to be a region (in fact) of England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed in a more free European arrangement, provided that we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway & apos; s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party Government in Scotland is, surprisingly, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority of votes in 2011, owing to objections to cost reductions proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Treasury, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent coalition of tori and liberal democracies.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence just to adopt the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sexual maturity: old before
African-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty before their white peers show research.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturity is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic can be one of the early puberty mechanisms
The trend towards early sexual maturity is less pronounced among boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Eteridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should the mother be afraid if her daughter starts to have a breast and pubic hair growing at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, a child endocrinologist, Dr. Paul Kapalowitz, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and are a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming my parents - usually it doesn't mean a rapid onset of full sexual maturity," said Kapalowitz.
There are obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair and body smell, that girls have before.
But there was only a small shift at the age of menarche (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the median age was 12.5 years and fell from 12.75 in 1970.
"After the breast is developing, it takes at least two or three years before the menarch," said Kapalowitz, also the author of the book "Early sexual maturity of girls: how to deal with this common problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how sexual maturity will progress.
There is a discussion on what constitutes a de facto sexual maturity but is considered "premature" when the increase in the breast is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - that pediatrician can be closely monitored.
More rapid progress can be used as a basis for endocrinologist analysis to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature ageing of bones, which can ultimately lead to lower growth and low growth at a mature age.
The recommendations on medical or hormonal treatment are based on the child & apos; s age, level of development, rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psycho-social aspects are also important.
The Kaplowitz is careful with the drugs, but recognizes that "the suppression of puberty can reduce the behavioural problems and the feeling of girls that they are different from those of their peers."
The other big problem is that parents just don't want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They're worried about the risk of pregnancy, or even how they can deal with hygiene," said Caporowitz.
"It was a shock," a woman who had a menstruation at 10.
Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are a lot of public theories about the reasons for early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are responsible for milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
In boys - like girls - sexual maturity is early.
Kaplowitz claims that the condition that is most important is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, it helped to conduct a study of girls between 6 and 9 years of age, which links the amount of fat in the body to the time of puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
There are various explanations.
Globally, early sexual maturity is likely to be affected by everything, from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery is that while boys have hair on their faces and on their lobes at a younger age, the trend towards full early sexual maturity is not as strong as that of girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The emergence of jumpy and pubic hair is even found in infants and children of the nursery age.
"We have to be careful how we determine the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a children's endocrinologist at the Gorieb Children's Hospital in Morristone, New Jersey.
Parents should not be shy to receive instructions from a pediatrician on how to speak to their child.
"This could mean earlier than expected, a conversation," Kablowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will generally react well.
Girls who bloom early need to be confirmed that even when this is done earlier, this process is a normal part of life.
The American Boeing, trapped in Chit, is preparing to leave.
In the framework of the Treaty on Open Skies, observation flights over Russian territory and an unplanned landing in Chita on Friday, 1 November, at 8: 30 Moscow time, an American aircraft will leave the city & apos; s air harbor.
The airport authorities allowed the flight of the boat to take the money for the fuel.
It was reported at the airport that the aircraft would fly to Ulaanoude.
According to other data, he's going to the United States.
It was reported that an aircraft flying to Ulaanouda landed in Zabaykali province because of the fog.
He was not released from Chita airport because of unpaid accounts.
The aircraft has 30 personnel on board, including a crew, who spent two nights at the airport, reporting to ITAR-TASS.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, under the terms of the Treaty on Open Skies, people on board an aircraft are not allowed to go outside Chita airport, but they can only be subject to border control at two Russian airports, in Kubinka and in UlaanUda.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992 and is attended by 34 States.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, to promote the monitoring of arms control agreements, to enhance the capacity to prevent crises and to resolve crisis situations within the framework of OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do dead celebrities make - the MC in the United States of America, the MK?
In 2013, Madonna made $125 million of the most high-income living celebrities.
But her late Michael Jackson, who had a post-mortem income of 160 million between October 2012 and October 2013, was "overthrown."
Other celebrities who have lost their lives, who have earned a few times less last year, are noticeably behind him.
The second one on the list of the most "wealthy" celebrities of the year's Forbes magazine was Elvis Presley, 55 million in a year, and the line below is the author of the Pinut comic books, Charles Schulz, with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, a former leader (25 million), and a musician, Bob Marley (18 million), were the first five.
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein were also on the list.
The first boutique of Igor Gulayev opened in Moscow.
On 23 October, the first flagship boutique, Igor Gulayev, was opened in Moscow.
The design of Igor Gulayev is known to the general public for its excellent products from the meth of the Lux class.
And now they can be evaluated by even more fashion fans - his first boutique was finally opened in Moscow, about which the designer and a dolce vita-style party were set up.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
So I'm particularly glad I have a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
It was with such words that Igor cut the red tape and invited all those who wished to... try on the models that had been taken care of!
Reactive aircraft manufacturers are hostile about the width of the seat when large orders are at stake.
There was a violent dispute between the leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of the tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a violent confrontation at the Dubai Air Exhibition this month.
The dispute is about the width of seats provided on long-range flights to Eco-class passengers whose interests are not always the focus of the airline, while the space allocated to them is key to the performance of the last aircraft proposed by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called for an industry standard that would have a seat width of not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in an eco-class salon, but its main American competition, Boeing, said that it was up to the airlines to decide.
The dispute is taking place at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in the sale of increasingly large versions of their two-engine long-range aircraft, and a potentially record order is expected at the 17-21 November event.
The structure of the rear of the aircraft - especially whether 9 or 10 people are in a row - is central to the cost-effectiveness of the new mini-bus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will contain 406 people, based on seats in an economic class of more than 17 inches in width, located 10 in each row.
Airbus says that a competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 people in an eco-class on seats with a width of 18 inches, 9 in a row.
Air force giants often exchange technical strikes by advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is directly public before the Dubai air show, where 77X is expected to be a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated how a new advertising war could be launched by showing financiers a slide that portrays three people in a restaurant that was chained to each other, called "Would you agree to that?"
"Boeing offers long-range flights on seats narrower than regional turbine aircraft," said the manager of Airbus, John Lehi.
With a change in the diet, people gain weight, but the air seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the broadband Boeing 747 set the standards for modern long-term travel, and the age of the century, the average American man aged 40-49 increased by 10 per cent, according to the US Department of Health.
The 21-century average American male waist coverage is 39.7 inches, according to US health statistics.
Airbus claims that her competitor followed the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average of the waist of those who were recently called the "active public" was already.
Airbus says he ordered a study showing that an additional inch in the width of the seat would improve the quality of sleep by 53%.
Boeing challenges the Airbus size figures and says that producers should not interfere with decisions on how airlines can find a balance between tariffs and convenience.
According to her, research shows that the convenience of the passenger compartment is not limited to the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving airlines the choice and the opportunity to do what they think they should do for success," said Kent Craver's Boeing salon.
They don't want us to decide for them, which will make them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase the space on the side, but for suppliers it is increasingly a factor that can affect profits.
This dispute is followed by a race for aircraft orders, estimated at at at at at least $700 billion at catapic prices in the coming decades - enough to change the ratio of American to European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the location of the seats is exactly what warms the competition between the latest jet aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20% increase in one place in their last two-engine long-range models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The stated Boeing characteristics are partly based on a comparison of the 10-local series 777X with the original 9-local series of constructive decision 777.
The gains in unit cost are being reduced from the 10-local design currently used.
"The reason why Boeing is doing this is to get more seats and make his plane more competitive than our development," said Kevin Keniston, the head of the Airbus passenger comfort department in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that a full-size 10-line salon for the existing 777th indicates that many passengers prefer a dense seat that can go hand-in-hand with lower tariffs.
"The seats of 18 inches wide would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is a threat from the 777th model," said the interierist Mary Kirby, the founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply chairs, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
World-driven jet vendors even bring roulettes to check competing plans.
With a high level of comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very tight saloon for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with a 10-line, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus had stressed the need for additional salon modifications, offering more space at the passage of some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, as the experts say, her call for a new industry standard is unlikely to "take off," but may divert attention from the 77X sales wave.
A new anti-nicotine vaccine can take away the process of smoking pleasure.
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take away the process of smoking cigarettes of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine dependence for life.
Further tests are needed before human testing, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Well Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are encouraging.
"We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to leave by trying all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it by these modern means," Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of antinicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
The antibodies track any molecules of nicotine in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine impact.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, which were subsequently provided with nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And the mice who were not given the vaccine were "relaxed," and that's a sign that nicotine came to their brain, "the researchers say.
These experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain high levels of antibodies, the injections had to be made so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were fully safe, it could be given to children before they were willing to try a cigarette to prevent nicotine dependence.
But it's more likely that it will be used by smokers to stop smoking.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't be enjoying it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that could help them get rid of that habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that further research was needed.
Oleiniki: one third of the rural settlements of Podoskovya are fully subsidized
The Vice-Governor of Podmoskovya, Yuri Oleinikov, stated that almost one third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region were fully subsidized.
A total of 187 out of 288 settlements receive subsidies from the region & apos; s budget.
In 2013, 187 out of 288 settlements received grants from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget of 122 rural settlements is over 50 per cent and 83 per cent is in the amount of grants.
As part of the budget, some 25 billion roubles are allocated from the regional budget, "said Oleinikov.
The Vice-Governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mitizk, Edozovo and Pushkina - had a budget of more than 1 billion roubles in 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million roubles, "this is not enough."
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements in Podoskovya is over 70 per cent, "with a decline in the quality of services," Oleiniki noted.
He had previously instructed the heads of the municipalities of the Podoskovya before the end of November to think about which settlements needed to be consolidated, merged into urban districts or changed in administrative management.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
The Governor of the Moscow region had previously stated that, as part of the administrative reform in Podoskovya, there were plans to reduce the number of rural grant settlements.
There is also a request for the consolidation of municipalities in Mojaya, Kashir, Salnechnogorsk, Kolomensk districts, Lubertsev and Kotelnikov.
Discussions on this issue in the cities and regions of the region will begin in November.
The President of Mosolduma, Igor Brozalov, also stated that some 30 rural settlements in 12 areas of Podomoskovya were planning to be consolidated as part of the forthcoming Admreform.
This is due to the fact that out of 178 rural settlements in Podoskovya, less than one third have a "acceptable" financial base and 100 have a grant.
Diana Arbenina was celebrating Halloween with his children.
Diane Arbenin is not hiding how much pleasure she is getting from raising her children.
Even though it is now that Arbenina is giving much time to creativity and public activities, she still finds a way to deal with Martha and Artem, not only wasting time learning them, but also entertaining as she can.
In the last week, Diana has reported twice to his fans about his teaching skills.
At first, she put a picture on Facebook that shows her how to teach children to read.
And last night, I was a fan, showing you how Artem and Martha dressed up for Halloween.
For a broom race, our first half is ready. "That's what Diane called a picture of his children in the holiday suits.
Which is not wise, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany is the first country in Europe to introduce "undefined sex" when registering children.
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow children born of hermaphrodists to be registered instead of men or women to say "undetermined."
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the "sex" in the birth certificate unfilled.
For "F" (female) or "M" (male), parents may record "X" (uncertain) for a time.
This decision is intended not to encourage parents to rush into a "gender-specific" operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born hermaphrodite.
Tripoy denies being influenced by Obeid.
The former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, Joe Tripoy, will be the subject of an investigation into the anti-corruption oversight body of the State.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripoy, denies the change in the lease of the overseas facilities at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, who was secretly in possession of the debts in three real estate on State land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had lobbied for several state ministers to extend the lease to Serkülar Ki, where the Obeid family owned two restaurants and cafes, without having passed the tender after their expiry in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripovi was aware of Mr. Obeid & apos; s secret participation in real estate, following statements by the former Deputy Chief of Administration, Mr. Tripoy Lynn Ashpoul, on Thursday.
During several years of discussion, which began in 2005, the Government insisted that the rent be presented for an open competition.
The tenants were against it, and they also wanted a longer lease.
In 2009, the contracts for the Sercyular Ki, which brought about $2.5 million per year to the Obeid family, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripori, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 until November 2009, initially advocated open competition.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, according to Mr. Tripoi, had strongly recommended changes to the Government & apos; s rental policy.
In an ICAC-provided telephone decryption, discussions were held in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripoi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the leadership of Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
"Was the issue discussed during these telephone calls a question of the development of commercial lease policies?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wuli, Mr. Tripoy.
"No," Mr. Tripori said.
I can't remember what was being discussed, but it was definitely not the same.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
According to a high-level official, Israeli military aircraft are attacking targets inside Syria
A high-ranking management official, in an interview with Fox News, confirmed that Israeli warplanes had attacked a target in the Syrian port town of Lathiqiyah on Thursday evening.
The man didn't specify what the target was, but he said at least one.
Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel launched air strikes on the cargo with missiles inside Syria.
Foreign workers for Division 457 visas may be tested for "authenticity"
The "authenticity" test for foreign workers on class 457 visas is under consideration by the Government, as it is an extension of repressive measures.
The test, if adopted, will be applied on the basis of criteria to prevent the use of class 457 visas for unskilled posts or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The paper submitted by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Labour Deputy Maxine McKay criticized the Government & apos; s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying that it could hurt Australia & apos; s neighbours.
"Thunder statements like" foreigners at the end of the line "and" first work for Australians "are a very unpleasant setback to the time when trade unions demanded a secure labour market," she said to the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, it meant that it was white work that needed to be protected - and if some in the region saw the resignations of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The paper presented for discussion sets out 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials about human trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes and the rest are under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criteria are adopted, the applicant for a visa can be examined "whether the candidate is true under conditions where the candidate is a relative or a close acquaintance of the owner or person involved in the financing of the business."
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of visa holders of Division 457, since previously, enterprises that had intended to sponsor a small number of workers then recruited hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker died of an alleged heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The nine-year-old son of this man, who was killed in grief, accompanied him on his way to Australia, and he has been supported by a cousin since his father died on Wednesday, who was also on board.
The Australian authorities quickly sent a man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A friend of Sémena Varlamova said that a hockey player was suffering from alcoholism.
A friend of a hockey player, Semena Varlamov Yevgenia Vavriyuk, said that he was suffering from alcoholism and handed over the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said, in particular, a woman.
We will recall that Vavrinyuk has been sued for being beaten on the floor by a Russian team, Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockey guy dragged her by her hair, and also beat her - her hands, chest, stomach and neck were damaged after the attack.
The Varlamov himself came to the Denver police and confessed to being beaten, detailing what had happened.
He was arrested but later released on bail at $5,000.
The court did not limit the athlete to movement across the country, but did not allow him to approach Waveryuk.
He also faces a prison sentence of up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at improving the economic impact on Scotland of the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project is designed to open high-speed communication with Scotland and the North of England, starting with the First Phase in 2026.
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, noted that the project would "unify Britain."
The Minister of Transport of Scotland, Keith Brown, said that he was "thrilled" with the prospect of working on a plan with the British Government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When Phase II is completed, the lines will be built into Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and North England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and a reduction in travel time for North England and Scotland.
This should include an opportunity to travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our goal on HS2 is to create a real national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other."
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis on our railway network.
But it is also about the transport of cities to each other; 18 cities throughout the United Kingdom, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better served by HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added, "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to "explicitly" support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing great economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the general argument for the high-speed railway throughout the United Kingdom."
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, the creation of benefits for all and the continuation of the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway line already planned by the Scottish Government.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with British ministers next year and to taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Tori is a new hope for nuclear power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to support energy needs.
The combustion of hydrocarbons (where they exist) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy requires large areas for generation.
Nuclear power is not available, but leaves a lot of expensive waste management.
Recently, scientists drew attention to the thorium, another radioactive element of the Mendelev system.
It is found all over the world and, according to the experts, it does not leave waste to be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia remain in force for the time being
Australian airline passengers will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite measures in the United States to reduce the rules on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Department has allowed United States carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, provided that they remain in the "Flight Regime."
The passengers can already do so during the main part of the flight, but many are concerned that they do not have access to their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required United States airlines to do a great deal of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Office also noted that they were considering the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in force in Australia.
"The Civil Aviation Aviation Safety Authority does not currently have specific rules on the use of electronic devices on aircraft," it stated.
The issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at any time and passengers to comply with the safety rules reported to them by the crew.
The company Virgin, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not opposed to changes, but stated that it would follow the instructions of the regulator.
"We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of the issue of allowing the use of electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the quality of client services now that it (on-board wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft," said the press secretary.
Qantas stated that he would follow the rules currently in force.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we are not planning to change it in the near future," she said.
The FAU regulation applies to United States airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could be of benefit to passengers, and we will certainly give careful consideration to the decision of the FAU and the reasons for it.
For US carriers, the impact of the order will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as to review manuals, training materials, manual delivery standards and passenger instructions.
"Once the airline has checked and confirmed the safety of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones at any height," the FAU stated.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group & apos; s recommendation, the heavier devices should be located under the seats or in the upper baggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan is heard in the guise of Kubani notes of extremism.
A football match between Anji and Kubanyu came into a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar province and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the Kubani ann sounded different.
The head of Dagestan, Ramazan Abdulatov, on Thursday, invited the Republican parliamentarians to bring their case to justice because the Krasnodar province's anthem allegedly called for inter-ethnic discord, inter alia, calling for war against the "basurmans."
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar province, which is the time that the anthem were approved in 1995.
It's a shame, and no one's doing it.
"You are mentioned here as a mother, an enemy, a bausumanin, and we are going to a death fight" - for which such words are written into a anthem, to poison some believers against others, "expressed solidarity with Abdullativ the President of Parliament, Hizri Shihsaid.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad.
And now, the news is from the ocean, that is, from Syria, where, as we have learned today, Israel has attacked Russian-produced missiles that were reportedly intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has met an important requirement to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached through Russia, which allowed the US not to carry out a military operation that it had come to this summer.
More about the weapons and what this means to the Syrian President, our chief international correspondent, Richard Angel, will tell us.
Washington stated that the Assad regime would be punished for it.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died of poisoning gas in August.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal made by a friend of Assad, Vladimir Putin.
Syria will renounce its chemical weapons by mid-next year.
And today is an important milestone.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had disrupted the declared chemical-warfare factories.
The longer-term challenge is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad's days were numbered.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will.
He's no longer legitimate, and he has to go.
But Assad remains.
And I feel even more confident.
Its troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are disintegrated and poorly armed.
His people were forced to leave their homes, and many were starving.
Some people have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Al-Assad has escaped punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement is called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself gave the impression of a man ready to cooperate.
Today, in Washington, the US Ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of hunger, his mother is unlikely to be able to be killed by chemical weapons.
Assad's still holding on.
And it changes the weapon to power.
The President of the Russian Federation has established a separate Ministry of Construction and the WCA
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, established a new Ministry responsible for construction and the WKH and proposed that he be led by the ex-Governor of the Ivanovskaya region, Mikhail Menu, in a personal meeting.
The President met with Michael Menem at a residence in Novo-Ogarevo, and Men did not refuse to take over the new office.
The Spokesperson for the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, explained that all construction and construction functions were being transferred to a new Ministry from the Ministry of the Region.
Mikhail Men is the son of a well-known Orthodox priest, the protojeria of Alexander Me, who graduated from the Moscow Institute of Ubkin Oil Technology.
Since 1995, his political career has started - he has been elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergijevo-Posada region, was a member of the State Duma, the first Vice-Prime Minister of the Moscow Region, and the Vice-Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Men was Governor of the Ivanovskaya region.
The pawnshop owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties.
In a pawnshop at Bendemir's shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is laying a gold bracelet, ring and earring to pay for his daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there," said Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she makes $3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia - where household debt is growing - is that ValueMax, where she is making her deal, is the third pawnshop registered on the Singapore stock exchange this week.
It is not just a fast way to get money (S $1300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga), but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore, pawnshops usually charge an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent - just above 15.4 per cent proposed at the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a subsidiary at the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require credit or proof of wages and can issue loans faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people across the region are entering pawnshops, as families are being pressured by higher cost of living and a rapid increase in household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and low-cost credit, fuelled by free monetary policies in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to compensate for the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, indicated an increase in the family's credit shoulder, mainly due to the increase in the mortgage, as a risk to the credit capacity of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list from 80 per cent of GDP to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which is barely out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing decline in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
"The point is that, with higher prices, people in the middle and bottom of [the income scale] will be looking for ways to supplement their income where they can," said Song Sung Wun, an economist of CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The record high gold prices over the past two years have increased the haste with which people put their personal effects, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items placed at 200 city-state pawnshops are gold products.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's put a gold chain on my grandmother and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest EasyMoney pawnshop operator has seen an increase in the number of clients using his offices in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, an operator in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where he has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yah Lee Ching, the executive director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 per cent of the S $66 million that was raised this week as a result of the stock exchange in Singapore.
While some creditors had aroused criticism because of high interest rates, she said that the pawnshop not only offered cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also did not increase debt directly.
"Clients put in items they already own, and the monetization of personal assets does not increase household debt," she said.
The salary is gaining increased public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
And not only are the categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation being used by pawnshops.
The rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax's offices by putting on gold bars or Rolex's watch, which can give up to 60% of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all sectors of society.
"They include wealthy persons who need to borrow short-term money for business projects or investments, or small business enterprises that need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties," Ms. Yeah said.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
It is not the number of health facilities available and their status that are important for the population today, but the quality of health care provided.
The implementation of the programme "Modernization of the health care of the Tula region for 2011-2013" and the reorganization of our city's health facilities will make it possible to establish an optimal structure for the provision of health care to the population, including gynaecological patients, pregnant women and pregnant women.
For example, following the integration with the hospital, it is even more possible to bring in specialized specialists from the National Health Service (NHCB) to consult pregnant women with various pathologies and to conduct additional hospital-based surveys.
During the period of the modernization programme, the material and technical base of the maternity home was significantly improved and modern equipment in line with world standards was introduced.
In these years, some 8 million roubles have been allocated for major renovation of the premises, and 112 items of equipment valued at 42 million roubles have been purchased.
The most modern equipment is an intensive post for newborns.
The Cesarean section is operated by a Sell-Seiver machine to collect blood from the operating wound and, after special treatment, to return her to her mother-in-law, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment has also been provided with a clinical laboratory diagnostic unit.
The women & apos; s consultation has an electronic record, and the introduction of electronic records and patient health reports is planned for the near future.
The development of telemedicine has made it possible to consult gynaecological patients, pregnant women, pregnant women and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
The children of Chechnya are arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been under way since March this year.
Some 60 women had complained about the actions of the Caucasus.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes to one of the Strasbourg hotels and then beaten and robbed them.
The head of the gang was a 27-year-old, previously convicted, Chechen-born.
Bavaria's advocate, David Alaba, became Austria's best athlete in 2013, reporting the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he has outstripped the representatives of winter sports, which have traditionally become the best in the country.
The second was the ski of Marcel Hirscher, and the third was the ski jump from Gregor Schlirenzauer's tram.
In the last season, a 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian origin helped his team win the Champions League, the German Championship and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Supercube.
Arshawin's ex-wife is resting with an actor, Andrei Chadov.
An ex-civilian wife of a "Zenita" Peter, Andrei Arshavin Yulia Baranovsky, is taking a leave with an actor, Andrei Chadov.
Yulia is a resident in Italy in the company of Actress Anastasia Zadoka, her fiancé is a member of Sergei Slavnov, and an actor, Andrei Chadov.
The images from the joint walk of couples are published in the Instagram Anastasia of Zadoka.
This is not the first joint picture of Andrea and Julia.
On October 5, the Vagilante published a picture of a couple being held on the coast of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, the "Zenita" Hawbeck, Andrei Arshawin, admitted to living separately from his civilian wife, Yulia.
As a reminder, Yulia Baranovsky and Andrei Arshawin have been together since 2003, having three children.
It has recently become known that Arshawin is meeting with an ex-model of Alice Kazmina.
Arshawin's new friend was married to the top manager of the corporation.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmania health
The Federal Government insists that a $325 million rescue package for a weakened Tasmania health system will be supplemented by harsh conditions that guarantee that the state government will not waste its money.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, announced that the Commonwealth was taking "urgent measures" to prevent a crisis caused by the ageing population of that island state, higher levels of chronic disease and restrictions on the system.
The four-year funding decision was made after consultation by the Government with the independent member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilka.
"The Government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific problems facing the State," Ms. Plybersek said today.
A $325 million package includes $31 million for a planning campaign.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataracts, will help to overcome the backlog.
There is also money for unrecorded clinics in Hobart and Lonceston to improve the quality of post-hospital care, training of medical professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health card systems in local hospitals.
"These investments will follow the ideas of advanced doctors on how best to help the Tasmania health system," Ms. Plibersek said.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmania Government would work under strict accountability and responsibility.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report on a monthly basis on where it is spending these additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and more effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilki said today that $325 million would not solve anything "unless they were followed by a genuine reform that would put Tasmania's health-care system on a more sustainable basis."
However, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to the state's critical state of health," Mr. Wilka said.
According to the State Government, these additional sampling procedures have largely offset recent reductions.
But the federal opposition for health, Peter Dutton, believes that today's statement is a "solution similar to a leukoplasm."
"The reason we're here is that the state's Labour Government took $430 million out of the health care system," he said to ABC TV.
When the state government is spending almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth is investing 300 million, you can't pretend it's good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plybersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The ecranization of Guillaume Niklu's novel, Denis Didro, can be commended for the exceptional presentation and historical details, but it is also more difficult than it should be.
The film, which takes place in France in the 171960s, tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat who was sent to the monastery by his family.
When she starts to rebel, she is extremely cruel at the hands of a sadist, and is the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to the bummer or the sensation - and that's the problem.
Because of its serious celebrity, the story risks becoming a test, like the master, for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons manufacture, said the monitoring team
Syria destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas, and declared on Thursday an international monitoring team, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites believed to contain toxic substances.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The statement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November set by the organization based in The Hague for Damascus to destroy or "make ineffective" all means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms for mixing chemicals with the production of toxic gas and filling in ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
This statement was made during the violent fighting on Thursday in Safira, where experts believe that the chemical weapons production facility, as well as their storage sites, is reported by the Syrian Centre for the Protection of Human Rights, based in Britain.
A group of activists who monitored losses through a network of activists in Syria stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of this number, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government & apos; s side, the group stated that 29,954 were members of President Bashar Assad & apos; s armed forces, 18,678 were pro-Government and 187 were Lebanese Hizbollah.
Also among the victims, as stated in the statement, were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to the UN assessment of 25 July, 100,000 have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad troops have been fighting rebels in Safir for several weeks, many of them associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that on Thursday there were victims on both sides but did not provide specific data.
The fighting stressed the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the short-term mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was "now satisfied that it has verified and seen the destruction of all critical equipment declared by Syria and mixing / fuelling equipment."
It added that "no additional inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, as the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that both sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and... chemical weapons programme items in them were moved to other declared sites that were verified."
It was not possible to find out immediately whether the site in Safir was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I welcome the courage and courage that you all have shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director-General of the monitoring group, Ahmet Uzumju, in the commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has been faced by the rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Government of Assad and its security forces, which are members of its Alawit sect and the administration of Shia Islam.
With regard to other developments, Rami Abdulrahman, the head of the centre, said that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday at the air defence site in the coastal province of Syria, Lathiqiyah.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
The anger of the punishment of the organizers of the Bali terrorist attack
The survivors and relatives of 202 victims of the Bali bomb in 2002 responded with anger to the sentence of the last of the conspirators, who had been brought to trial, and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
The Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run, as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years & apos; imprisonment for his role in creating explosive devices used during the attack.
He may be released for a period of 15 years if he is granted parole.
A 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass killings as a result of an attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kut, in which 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church explosions throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could have insisted that a person called a "bomber" for his reputation as a master of explosive devices should be sentenced to death.
This decision has exacerbated the painful memories of a mother from Pert June Cortin who lost his 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his associates almost 10 years ago.
Barely holding her tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
"I really think he should follow the footsteps of other guys.
He must stand before the shooting team, said Ms. Cortin AAP.
I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters. "
The "Sari" club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was detonated in an outside-parked van immediately after 11: 00 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar, where a suicide bomber blew up an explosive backpack just 20 seconds earlier.
Since then, he has been in a coma for a month and has been "dying" three times, being connected to the life support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of the other three members of the Jemaah Islamia terrorist cell responsible for the massacre, Amrozi, Muhlas and Imam Samumura, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most.
To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not so much.
Patek is the last party to the Bali terrorist attack to be brought to justice.
He had been in hiding for almost a decade, but was finally detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where United States troops killed Osama bin Laden, former leader of Al-Qaida, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent showed that intelligence showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't give up," said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he had not regretted how much grief he had caused other people.
The sentence is on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be observed later this year in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: "The air passengers can now use the gajets on the aircraft (but do not call from the mobile phone)."
The air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch films and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Authority on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly this change is being implemented, will vary according to the airline, as the FAU administrator, Michael Wert, said at a press conference.
The airlines will have to show the FAU how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their training manuals for crew members and the installation regulations to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
"Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve an increase in the use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said.
At present, passengers are required to disable their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the door of the aircraft is closed.
They must not relaunch them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives "good."
The passengers shall turn off their devices again when the aircraft is reduced for landing and shall not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected against electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during taking-off, landing and driving have declared FAU.
Most of the new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Gleying, President of the Association of Professional Actors, welcomed these developments.
"Once the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option," said Glading.
We're really tired of feeling "on duty at school" when it comes to this.
But surfing, e-mail, text or data downloading will still be prohibited at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency has reported.
The passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to the plane mode.
Thus, there is still no "Voice with Friends," an intellectual Internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his 2011 smartbackground when there was a known case: the actor was removed from an American Airlines aircraft for refusing to turn off the device while the aircraft was on its way to landing.
And the heavier devices, such as laptops, will still have to be put in the luggage compartment because they can hurt someone if they fly all over the parlor.
The calls from the mobile phone in the flight will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory power for telephone calls is vested in the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU.
The FAU may remove the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Council, a national expert on the security of CBS News, stated that cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially cause interference to navigation devices, but we know, thanks to the FCS, that they can cause interference to a cell phone tower when the plane is in the air," said Rosenker.
The Sectoral Advisory Committee established by the FAU to study this issue recommended last month that the Government allow for a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased in order to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics such as a Democratic Senator from Missouri, Claire McCash, claim that there are no good security reasons for the prohibitions.
It is also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce restrictions, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to one third of the passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAU began to limit the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of disturbances for navigation and communication equipment when passengers started carrying FM radios - high-tech gadgets at the time.
The new airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by the FAU as being resistant to electronic disturbances.
The airlines have been offering the use of the Wi-Fi at cruiser altitude for several years.
The aircraft modified for the Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disturbances.
The vast majority of the liners are designed to make greater use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, said Wert.
Today's electronic devices usually emit radio signals far lower than previous generations of devices.
Electronic book reading devices, for example, only provide minimum signals when pages are crossed.
But the signals become more powerful when the devices download or send data.
Among those who sought to reduce restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com..........................................................
In 2011, the company & apos; s representatives uploaded an entire airliner with their Kindle electronic book reading devices and flew on it to check that there were problems, but did not find them.
The members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices represented any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passenger Association stated that he considered the interference from the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the Committee said that there were only individual pilot reports that confirmed that the devices could cause interference to aviation systems, most of which were very old.
The Committee recommended, however, that the FAU allow pilots to require passengers to disable devices during boarding of devices in reduced visibility.
The group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sound step towards passengers who are now using many technological devices.
"We are pleased that the FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Doe, Director General of the United States Tourist Association.
Automotive schools will be able to take the driver & apos; s licence test
The driver & apos; s licence examination will be available to private companies with their own computerized vehicle vehicle.
This is written by the "Commissant" with reference to a draft Government Regulation "On the Admission to Driving."
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such vehicle droms in Russia.
It is expected that these "privileged" road schools will be able to count on the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Inspectorate will monitor the examination every six months.
If it is found that more than 30 per cent of the examination in theory and more than 20 per cent of the site are not passed from the first time, the school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for motor vehicles contained in the draft Government Regulation shall enter into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for driving training for two-wheeled equipment.
As from 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will be required to take an urban examination to obtain category A rights.
In addition, since 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers.
Such workers would be required to obtain Russian rights after the examination.
The bird, which was transported by air to a safe place from a drilling plant in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
The bird, which was transported by air to the shore after being found in a depleted state at an oil tower in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
The water shepherd was placed in a helicopter on his way to Aberdeen last month, and was then released by the Scottish section of the Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (SPCA) at the Alloa rescue centre.
The manager of the centre, Colin Ceddon, said, "This water shepherd is likely to be a winter migrant from North Europe who has entered a strong wind zone over the North Sea."
It looks like the bird is out of control and has been able to find a safe haven on the oil tower.
He added, "She was unable to take off again, so we were asked for help."
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the commitment to bring together business representatives and to determine what changes British welfare and employment creators want to see with the EU.
To that end, we have ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.
YouTube interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders who represent a wide range of businesses in the UK by size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently looking for export opportunities outside Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are upgrading and growing, while the EU is in a stagnation.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on a long and difficult process of reforming the EU's confused institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from competition regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general discontent with the single market, and business representatives stated that the costs of regulation from Brussels were now outweighing the benefits of being in the European trading area - even 40 per cent of the large enterprises traditionally the most pro-European of all companies.
Last and most notable, our survey of business leaders has shown that a clear majority want Britain to be a course for a change of contract and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This result, which has been observed among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on a "significant change" that will bring power back to Britain.
The rates are high - a change in the contract and a more favourable environment for Britain will provide a 16 per cent vote shift to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British business supports his plan to review the terms of British membership in the EU.
It also shows that business expects that the review will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back to Britain.
The best conditions for British business are possible and are becoming more necessary as the eurozone enters the path of closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the United Kingdom, and the results of our survey show that for business this means an increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in the normative activities of Brussels.
U.S. Special Services are listening to the Pope's personal phone.
The activities of the Vatican are under the vigilant control of the American Special Services.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that U.S. intelligence was listening to all of the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now very close to the Pope Francis.
His phone started listening before he became head of the Vatican.
The process of election of the new father was also monitored.
Which in the United States was given special importance.
The special service is connected to the cardinal's cell phones, which are gathered in Rome to select another Pope.
The numbers of the residence where the conclave was living were also heard.
American spies have been listening to all the main applicants for the papal throne to prevent it from having an undesired figure for Washington.
Panorama's magazine says that the "big ear of the United States" continued to intercept the talks of the prelates until the end of the 12 March conclave.
In the United States, it is alleged that, since 2005, Argentine Archbishop Bergelio has been identified as the future of the Pope of Rome.
American intelligence has also held negotiations in connection with the election of the new President of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine says that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives is still working at the US Embassy in Rome, which is gathering information about politicians and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican has been conciliated to say that he does not care about the American "wire" even if it does.
The US leadership has no secrets from the Holy Fathers.
The Snowkeeper for the Olympic bill was specifically photographed.
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued an aide-memoire on the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held.
The first bill is 100 roubles.
But on the network, bloggers are already actively ironic about the memo.
Following the presentation of the Olympic bill on 30 October, they noted that the image of a bank-based snowcleaner could be found in the photo banks.
In particular, it is available at the free StockExchange, where the photo is dated 2005.
The same photograph is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website "Megarek" on January 18, 2011.
It was also used in the RugGear smartphones commercial.
The Olympic Banquet is in the blue-blue gamma.
On the one hand, a sophomore flying over Sochi is shown, on the other hand, a species of the Olympic stadium and a hot bird.
The author of the design of the note is Pavel Bushuev, who won a competition among the students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts of Repin.
The presentation noted that several types of sports were considered - mining, fristail and tramplin, but had eventually been taken down because it was a relatively young sport.
According to the source "News," close to the ECB, the regulator is not indifferent to the public's opinion about the wide dissemination of the image of a snowcleaning player from the Olympic note and is currently studying the situation.
But in Gozlak, not too concerned about the noise around the Olympic note.
The head of the State Press Service, Natalia Nikiforov, stated to the "News" that all the arguments about plagiat were funny.
The note-breaker will turn right, and on the web, left, Nikiforov has been specified.
The man at the photo session was taken from different points to create the bill, then the final image was selected, and it had a typical sprinkler.
It also noted that the copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic Bank, as the artist had received a salary for work.
In the view of the experts, the discussion on the Olympic bill is very positive.
The recognition of the image on the bill - plus for its promotion - is considered by the executive director of the NP "RusBand" Alexei Popopochev.
It is difficult to prove a 100 per cent similarity of images on the bill and in the photo banks, so it is unlikely that the intellectual property challenge will be brought against the image.
The first Olympic Banquet appeared in China, with an aide-memoire in 10 yuan for the Beijing Olympics in 2008.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
The legal prohibitions have forced Russians to drink less beer.
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to their figures, the country's beer consumption next year will remain at the same level, at best.
Although the business people were initially counting on growth.
This year is a bad year for them, with sales falling by 7 per cent.
This was described by the head of one of the country's largest brewery companies, the President of the Council of the Union of Russian brewers, Isaac Shepps, at the third annual conference of the Institute of Adam Smith, "Tovars of daily demand in Russia," which just ended in Moscow.
It discussed the government regulation of the market.
The Russian beer market had already declined by 18 per cent between 2008 and 2012, as in recent years there had been a significant increase in the regulation of the brewery industry with regard to the production and trafficking of beer, a drink with a low alcohol content, which had been reported to the Shepps.
No country in the world has such a severe restriction on the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of new and new inlogical prohibitions that are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewdriver visited that many of the legal prohibitions aimed at reducing alcohol abuse had not had a particular impact, but there were still new initiatives.
Most of the beer producers were hit by the ban on selling alcohol in kiosks since this year.
"We lost 35,000 consumers at once," said Isaac Sheps.
The brewers have two projections for next year.
Optimistic is the one that Shepps mentioned: the sale of a foam drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic, falling 2-3%.
In order to keep their profits, businessmen have to move from mass-consumer classes to the "primium" class: beer will become smaller, but it will be more expensive.
However, the radical effects of the decline in low-alcohol sales are not yet visible.
"According to my observations, the level of alcoholism remains about the same," said the drug doctor Alexei Sotnikov.
Indeed, there has been an increase in the proportion of patients who use strong-drink surrogates, as well as those who "have been" on alcohol-containing tonic beverages like "Jaguar," while a decade ago, the "beer" alcohol dominated.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford car plant in Tvodrovsk.
As they say in the trade unions, all those who were fired received compensation.
However, a reduction in the region & apos; s production is more important than workers & apos; problems.
The Regional Officer of Zachsa Alexei Etmanov stated at the meeting that some 600 people had been reduced at the Ford plant in Tvvovovovovsk.
He said that this had happened since September, when about 600 people had left the plant under the voluntary dismissal programme, which had been developed with the organization & apos; s trade union.
A "gold parachute" of several salaries was offered to a worker who decided to resign.
As a result, the vast majority have left their jobs of their own free will.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's going to be the case.
However, the authorities did not plan to adopt any programme in the next two years to support regional enterprises in difficult circumstances, "he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction in jobs when adopting the budget.
In Ford, this information is neither refuted nor confirmed.
We're waiting for an answer from the company, and as soon as it shows up, we'll have to publish it.
There are long-standing discussions about the reduction of workers at the Ford plant in the Strovosk.
For example, the company & apos; s plans to fire 600 people had been known as early as September.
The plant had previously declared a suspension of the production of vehicles.
The reason for the plant was the fall in the demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, industrial production in the Lenzfield has been reduced by 5.4 per cent as a result of nine months of 2013.
The production of vehicles and equipment has been reduced by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, it will be possible to use mobile phones during the take-off and landing of an aircraft.
The new regulations for the safe use of mobile devices during the take-off and landing of the airliner have been approved in the United States and are reported by BBC.
United States airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the voyage, and new regulations will be in place by the end of 2013.
However, communication with the Internet to receive and send e-mail will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometres.
Because of the risk of interference with the radio equipment of the aircraft, cellular voice will continue to be banned.
Thus, air passengers will be allowed to read electronic books, play games on tablets and other gadgets, and watch video during internal and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the United States Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile vehicles on aircraft control equipment and equipment.
According to the source, as in the United States, it will also be possible to review the existing standards for the use of electronic devices in flights.
The "Russian Mafia" in the United States is finally a new name, "The Brotherhood Circle."
This week, the black list of "Russian Mafia" in America was added with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Treasury Department has introduced three Russian representatives, two Uzbek citizens and an Israeli member of the Brotherhood Circle.
One of the Russians turned out to be a famous singer, Gregory Lepps, who the US is suspected of transporting money to members of the group.
In fact, there are 22 people on the US black list who are involved in the Brotherhood Circle and six affiliated with it.
However, many experts have expressed doubts that such an organization does exist.
"The 'Brotherhood Circle' statement is more like an attempt to unify the divided criminal groups," a previous statement by the organized crime expert and a professor at the University of New York, Mark Galeotti.
In his view, the "Bratsky Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian Mafia."
"I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would have confirmed the existence of such a criminal organization," cited by Mr. Galeotti of the United States Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti also agreed with Professor George Mason Liz Shelley of the University.
"If they act together, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization," the Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "Bratsk circle" was a more close Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Ded Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January this year.
For example, the activities of Lashi Shushanawvili and Zachariya Kalashov, who added up to the list in 2012, were closely linked to Ded Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was a nephew.
He noted, however, that some individuals were not related to Usoyan.
In his view, they were all more of a common financial and criminal interest, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, a scandal about the inclusion of Grigory Lepsa, the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the Brothsk Circle, drew the attention of the Kremlin.
Of course, we expect to receive more information from our American partner colleagues, so this decision was taken as to why it was placed on such lists, as stated by the press secretary of the Head of State, Dmitri Peskov.
In any case, he (Lepps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
The interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation will be protected, as will the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation.
The head of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field.
The beginning of the construction of the Southern Flow gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, as stated by the head of Gazprom.
"Today was a landmark event: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the southern stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
The "South Flow" is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is destined for Europe, increases the risk to normal routes, is said by officials.
Miller stated that a direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "forever" addressed.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the "South Flow" at a reduced price as soon as the entire project is operational in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning, in the Sarat district, the driver of the Peugeot car took a 115-km road to the front lane of Odessa-Reni, and ran into a bus with six people.
This is reported by the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the State of Odessa.
A 31-year-old car driver, Peugeot, died in an accident.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver, who had a leg, suffered.
The medical staff provided the woman with the first medical care on the ground, and she refused to be hospitalized.
Ambulance officers also examined all other passengers.
The rescue forces lifted the bus and released the driver of the bus, whose foot was stashed in the bus door.

Two YMCA officers have been charged with sexual offences before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission has become aware.
Two officers of YMCA NSW were accused of sexual offences against children before being charged in 2011 against a child-care officer at the Karingbach, Jonathan Lord, and reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
But the Commission's opening statement stated that it had "never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization."
The Chief Executive Officer, Philippe Hare, was asked about one case in which an YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another case in which an instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children under his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Ferness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew of the first case but did not know of the second.
He admitted that YMCA also made inaccuracies in the Commission's opening speech, arguing that "there were external YMCA checks that recognized that YMCA was at the top of the child security line."
The evidence submitted to the commissions indicates that YMCA was informed that it had received a second of four possible quality evaluations from the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined YMCA when he was 21 years old, recognized that he and the lower management had failed by hiring Lord and had not been able to ensure that staff had a clear understanding of their obligations to report violations of child security policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hair rejected the suggestion that the corporate ethics of YMCA prevented staff from reporting violations of Lord in the area of child security.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with the children, taking care of them personally, putting them on his knees, saying that he loved one of them and allowing them to play his mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was under Lord's leadership and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that she found Jackie Barnat, the child custody manager of the YMCA office in Karingbach, who was Lord's leader, "very scary and often difficult to reach."
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the staff members & apos; explanations that they had been uncomfortable to report the situation to their senior managers.
Rather, he said that their friendship with Lord had taken them away from the idea of having to report him.
Mr. Hair said that he had presented his opinion to the New South Wales YMCA Board that the lesson to organize from the "Jonathan Lord incident" did not "concern the provision of information" by staff members, and the Board agreed with it.
Mr. Hair stated that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the charges were made was taken by the YMCA Director-General of Child Care, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was intended to prevent the deterioration of evidence, but that it was "overworked" and that the decision was not implemented.
YMCA New South Wales was not a safe organization for children while Jonathan Lord was working for the period 2009-2011, and an expert on child abuse, Professor Stephen Smallboy of the University of Griffith, reported to the commission.
He said that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, selection, guidance, training and monitoring of staff.
The hearing has been postponed until 20 December.
A fashion week in São Paulo.
She's not just a mannequin, she's a real star.
Even though Giselle Bundschen left her job for a while, distracting herself from her mother's life, she came on a special occasion these days and this week of the day.
A long-term absence did not prevent her from keeping her place on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the highest-paid supermodel of the world.
This time, she was involved in the "Colcchi" default.
The end of fashion weeks is usually the most interesting show.
Like the one that organized Lino Villaventura's stylist.

Tony Blair said he would take a chance to return as British Prime Minister, but he admitted that return was unlikely.
On the eve of the evening, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, a 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after 10 years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussions on British policy, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador to a quarter of Middle East peacekeepers.
In response to a question as to whether he would have returned to the post of Prime Minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said, "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so..."
Messiliano Allegri, Chief Coach of Milan, expressed regret at the result of the 10-round Italian Championship with "Lacio."
The expert also noted that the failure at the start was due to a series of injuries of leading players.
I'm very sorry we couldn't win, which brings out the words of Allegri.
The team played a good game, creating three or four good opportunities.
In the first time, we didn't let "Lacio."
The second Romans were added, but in general, I can't say we lost concentration.
You should have won.
In the last season, we did the task of going to the Champions League.
We are now behind schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries to key football players.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players, with a character.
However, our composition is still good.
Look at the High-level Meeting Kaka.
The connosports experts who were going to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year prize knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a school boy, who had taken his first steps only a few months earlier, that little boy, with his Scottish pony pet, Toffy, had a three-round run to get the main prize easy, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple, the same growth, received high ratings for appearance, behaviour and style at an annual contest held by the Sannibenk Centre of Cone Sports in Radri, near Cardiff.
When he went on to look at the background of men and women in fine-looking kitten hat, he moved his hat and proudly spent two-year-old Toffy around.
The judges praised Fenton for his ingenious congenital ability to handle horses for not years.
And Toffi was highly rated for appearance and nature.
Fenton was given to Toffy for his third birthday last March, and since then he has been working with a Scottish pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffy make up a beautiful duet."
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cube and a pink.
It was just his second performance with Toffy, and we were all excited when he won.
The unfamiliar people in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Ebb Vale in South Wales, follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howels, who has been throwing horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howels said, "The entire audience was struck, and everyone was screaming for approval and clapping."
He was running around the sand all over the length of the arena, and even though he looked so tiny, he did a great job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
From the way he started, he's about to take part in the Year's Horses, and I'm sure he'll be doing well.
The representative of this annual horse exhibition said, "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to treat his pony."
They're a great team together.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and for the way they presented themselves at the show-ring.
They appreciate the consistency of the pony and the factory, Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, and he really looked good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper that published the appeal "to be redesigned"
The Chinese newspaper, which published a first-page call for the release of an accused in the slander of a reporter, should be reorganized, and the press regulator will report.
The newspaper New Express, published in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with State ownership.
Now, the "New Express" has to go through a "full correction process," as the regulator says.
The order for "correction of errors" came from the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Office.
A preliminary investigation found that the Yangcheng Evening News Group newspaper New Express published several false reports on Zoomlion's registered exchange between September 2012 and August 2013.
The "New Express Guide" was disoriented, "as stated in the regulatory statement.
He states that it has been decided "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of a withdrawal of his reporter's licence."
He also "instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to fully correct the errors in the New Express and recommended that it investigate the situation-related newspapers and make immediate changes to the leadership of the New Express."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, in which he reported financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page, stating that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on State television, recognizing that he had published false articles for money.
"In this case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire media news industry and its ability to gain public trust," he said the State-owned CCTV broadcasting company.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen's confession, "The New Express" published an apology on the front page, stating that the newspaper had not been able to properly verify his reports.
Several high-level suspects have recently made a confession on television.
The experts say that the practice of beating confessions is still widespread in China, despite recent amendments to laws that prohibit the authorities from forcing anyone into self-incrimination.
A United States-Mexico drug-transfer tunnel, equipped with its own railway, has been found
One of the most complex drug-smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been found.
The US authorities described this tunnel four-by-three-foot wide as one of the most difficult secret moves they have ever found.
This tunnel, which has a zigzags of almost six football fields, links the warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (United States).
The area is filled with unmarked warehouses, which facilitates the clandestine loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were unnoticed, as the authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement officials confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when a tunnel was found.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officials, had been charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they face prison terms ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage found in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were found in Central Mexico following the harvest of marijuana in October, which made it difficult for drug cartels to deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of approximately 700 yards, with a track that went from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
In Belarus, pensions have been increased since November
In Belarus, pensions have been increased since November this year and have been reported to the BELTA correspondent in the General Pension Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
As of 1 November 2013, the average wage of workers in the Republic applied in the previous revaluation of pensions will be adjusted, with an increase of 5.4 per cent, and the corresponding adjustment of labour pensions will be made in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on the increase of pensions.
As a result of the recalculations, it is estimated that the age pension will increase by an average of 5.3 per cent from November.
The average age pension would be Br2 million 295 000
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million inhabitants of the Republic.
The cost of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus for increased pensions will increase by Br274.3 billion per month from November this year.
At the same time as the recalculation of labour pensions in November of this year, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and pensions will be recalculated as the average per capita subsistence budget increases.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million 47,000 530, a 2.1 per cent increase over the period from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, the minimum labour pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and pensions will be increased by 2.1 per cent from 1 November.

The British police are giving Assanj a notice of extradition.
The British police have now given notice of the extradition of the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and has sought asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they had given a 40-year-old Australian "official request to surrender" to the police station, adding that if they failed to do so, they would be further arrested.
Assanju is at risk of being extradited to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he has exhausted his capacity under British law, when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
He was afraid that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, and on 19 June he had taken refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, seeking political asylum from that South American country.
Scotland Yard "has given a 40-year-old man an official request to surrender, which requires him to come to the police station on the day and time of our choice," as the press secretary has said.
He continues to violate the terms of his bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the service of the police notification.
Assange is afraid that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible espionage charges following the publication of over 250,000 American diplomatic depositions on the WikiLeaks' anti-secrecy website.
A driver driving at 130 miles an hour with a hot drink between his legs is fined $1,000.
The vehicle was fined £1,000 for driving at a speed of up to 130 miles per hour (210 km / h) with a hot drink held between the legs.
The 35-year-old Andrew Howie of Tiptri, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz at A120 on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to take him out between his legs.
In the World Court, Colchester Howie admitted the charge of driving without due diligence and attention.
The addition to his driving licence of seven penalty points resulted in a six-month ban on driving.
Howie was also required to pay the costs of £90 and an additional fee of £100 to assist victims of crime.
A tax for foreign real estate owners will cause the London bubble to burst
The Treasury had made a preliminary assessment of the capital increase tax measure, but was awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who had introduced a 7 per cent State duty rate in the 2012 budget for houses with a value of over £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decided to own a home in a partnership rather than as natural persons.
To date, the master of housing in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea regions, which amounted to £708 million in the 2012 / 13 financial year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Hamber together.
Mr. Cook said: "It is very difficult to claim that the taxation of expensive real estate is understated after the increase in high-cost houses and the introduction of related anti-evasion legislation, regardless of the influence of an outdated municipal tax system."
"But this step may result in some foreign investors being reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners not willing to sell it," he added.
The value of first-class real estate - the top 5-10 per cent of the housing market at a price - in the rich south-west London belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8 per cent over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady annual growth of 5.6 per cent, but were overshadowed by an active "domestic market" with a rise in prices in the south-west, the north (7.4 per cent) and the east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists shed light on how the dog's tail movement is linked to her mood.
Early studies have shown that well-pleased dogs have a tail on the right side (from the dog's point of view), while alarmed dogs have a tail on the left-hand side.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can see and respond to these thin differences in tail forage.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, says, "It is well known that people have different left and right sides of the brain in the form of incentives that cause positive or negative emotions."
This is where we tried to look at it from other species.
He added that, just like human beings, the right-hand part of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemisphere play different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs respond to the multiple spikes of other dogs, researchers watched animals when they were watching movies about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of animal heartbeat and analysed their behaviour.
Perhaps soon we will understand why their tails are sometimes headed one way, and sometimes the other.
Professor Vallortigar said, "We have shown dogs a video of dogs - either a naturalist version or a silhouette to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct the tail to the left or to the right."
When animals saw that in other words, the unspeakable dog moved the tail to the right (in terms of a swinging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was inclined primarily to the left (again in terms of a swinging dog's tail), their heart rate was increasing and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigar said he didn't think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experience, which movements they should be concerned about and which are not.
He notes: "If there are several meetings with other dogs and their tail is often spiked in one direction with more friendly behaviour, and the right side is less friendly, the dog responds on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterans and riders a better understanding of their animal's emotions.
An expert in the field of dog behaviour, John Bradshaw, an invited researcher at the University of Bristol veterinary school, said that it was not the first study to verify whether dogs were relevant to the left and right.
Last year, a group of scientists from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a happy dog.
And in another scientific work at Victoria University in Canada, he said, "The dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when the swelling of its tail was directed to the left rather than to the right, rather than become alarmed, the opposite of Italian research."
He said that the difference could be because dogs in various studies did not fully view animals in films or robots as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"While there is sufficient evidence for different mammals that two hemisphere are used for different purposes, many details remain to be clarified, and dogs are not an exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, we will probably soon understand why their tails are sometimes directed to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys is postponing a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's illness.
The Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the concert in Glasgow after her vocalist had been diagnosed with laringitis.
This Shaffield group was supposed to perform on the city's Hydro concert site on Friday.
However, the disease of the vocalist Alex Turner made them move the show.
The band's statement was made after it was also forced to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on his official website, Arctic Monkeys said, "After a decision to move the show to the Burmingham LG Arena this evening and after a request for medical care, Arctic Monkeys should also postpone the show at the Hydro site in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November."
"Alex Turner was diagnosed with" laringitis, "and, unfortunately, he is not in a position to perform."
The show on the LG Arena in Birmingham will now be held on November 20, and the show in Glasgow on the Hydro site will be held on November 21.
All tickets to these shows remain valid.
We want to apologize to all the ticket owners for any inconvenience that this has caused them.
For any additional assistance, please contact the client service office of the ticket register in which you bought the tickets.
Pope Francis will call the first cardinal in February.
Pope Francis will set up the new Cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are the ones who elect the father, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually be involved in the selection of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinal.
However, once the Cardinal has reached the age of 80, he can no longer take part in the election of the Pope, which is the prerogative of the group of 120 "Cardinal-electors."
In announcing this news, Vatican's press secretary, Federico Lombardi's father, said that a meeting of all current cardinals, known as a concistory, would be held before the San ceremony.
"Pope Francis decided to report in advance on his decision to convene a concistory in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from different corners of the world," said Lombardy.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February the number of cardinal voters was likely to decline.
He said that the Pope usually called as many cardinal as necessary to bring the number of cardinal voters back to 120, as well as the number of cardinal candidates over 80 years of age as he would like.
The concistory next year will be important because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, according to Valero.
There is now a kind of bias in favour of Europe, and especially in favour of Italy.
"It would be interesting to see if the new father would appoint cardinal from other regions of the world to restore balance," he said.
In South America, 40 per cent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first selected cardinal since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, to look for ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad made up his own mind.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinal to help him," Valero said.
He said that "it's possible" that Francis would seek the cardinal's advice.
But we haven't been in a situation like this before, all for the first time.
Valero said that the Pope was usually taken as the cardinal of the bishops from the big parish, but Francis "is full of surprises - so we don't know who he's gonna call."
GM takes out a number of new picks in the US to refine the seat-backs.
General Motors Co has withdrawn almost 19,000 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra's 2014 model to address the problems of manual seat-back adjustment, in accordance with a Friday notification from US vehicle safety regulators.
In some of the pickup seats, the front seats may have a defect in the back-tilt mechanism.
As a result, seat back does not meet the federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"When a vehicle is hit at the rear, the head restraint may not adequately protect the occupants by increasing the risk of injury," as indicated in the notification on the website of the National Road Safety Administration.
The withdrawn models were produced from 1 August to 10 September.
The production of the GM pickup began in June and is the most important production of the car for the leading American car manufacturer since its restructuring due to the bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the pickup of a defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider a notification to the owners in connection with the 16-day termination of the Government, which had reduced the increase in car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as stated by GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra's picket.
The shares of GM on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
The cry of the despair of Obama's elector
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change.
He says that Obama has made it possible for the Republicans to be obstructive and to destroy their commendable efforts.
obstructionism cannot justify problems with Obama's reformed health-care system website, drone attacks
The memoirs of Obama's 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what could be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at the Harvard University of Medicine.
I read a terrible sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me during the second year of the medical school and give me a sense of hope.
It's called "Blast for victory," and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing my patients' reports and going to bed tonight, this book brings me back at a time when politics inspired millions of people, and the performance could take a breath.
The election victory has been impressive, and the leading news programmes have been a pause to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates were crying for joy, and my parents were saving every paper they could find.
The White House was supposed to be a young team of strategists, and the people were ready for change.
At the time of Obama & apos; s assumption of office in 2008, the level of support was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a gross awakening, like being pulled out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, changes have indeed taken place.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and diverse achievements, from the adoption of a law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the abolition of the "Don't ask, Don't Say" rule, the murder of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health choices and the closure of the Guantanamo base among others.
But after an countless time, when I was on the side of the Obama administration, protecting her in front of colleagues and peers, I ended up with an explanation that I could provide.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The republican obstructions cannot explain whether foreign leaders are allowed to listen or to be beaten by drones on innocent children in other countries.
He could not explain the collection of data on American private life by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of disclosure of government misconduct.
He cannot explain the murder of an American citizen, Anwar Al-Awlaqa, without trial or failure to meet the limits of public funding and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the findings of the report, which states that the efforts made by the White House to silence the media have been "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And recently, it cannot justify being unable to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the law on affordable health care.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 that leadership could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded it?
It is clear that work in an elected office is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by an opposition political party and by random events such as the massacre in Newtown.
However, for all the examples I have listed above, it is clear that they were, to a large extent, their own choice of administration.
And that's what worries me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and sad alternative, and it seemed that he was unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I was of the view that in his second term, as Obama was free from the pressure of future elections, he would meet the hopes that we have heard of over such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating fell below 45 per cent this week, it became much more difficult to return to 2008 through the book.
It makes me miss a lot of promises that have gone away.
This week, I read that part of the book that described how Clinton had made Obama a deafening defeat in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting to analyse the reasons for the failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain faithful to their purpose.
"I want us to return our attractiveness," he said.
- We have to remember who we are. "
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The views expressed in the commentary are limited to Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on child-care leave.
Deputy Billionaire Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest on child-care leave because his daughters could get pregnant and benefit from it.
This wave of the mining industry, which has an unresolved $6 million carbon tax dispute, made this statement at a time when it was trying to get away with the questions about whether it had a conflict.
The Palmer Joint Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can be crucial in the decision to eliminate carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only have been held by the ministers, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from political measures.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid child-care leave, because if any of these daughters are pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they will be taken leave," Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr. Palmer a winner for the seat from Sunshine-Cast of the Farfax electoral district, with a 53-vote overweight after the revote.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the voting procedure in order to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget's daughters.
Should the decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system that can come in, put our data on the computer, vote immediately and get a result at 6: 30 that night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for the ballot papers.
Is that because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
It seems strange to use a pencil these days.
The Electoral Commission is exploring the possibilities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sunshine-Cust and would take his new work "very seriously."
Public office is for the service of society.
"We do not seek any reward, except for the gratitude of history, for the fact that at a critical moment we can serve this district," he said.
The RBS removes two exchange-rate traders.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended two traders from its currency office, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is further evidence that global scrutiny by the regulators of the alleged currency market manipulation is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world & apos; s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with regulators in investigations related to the world & apos; s largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS staff to be removed during an ongoing investigation that is interacting with the inter-bank-rate manipulation scandal of LIBOR.
In refusing to comment on the suspension, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulatory authorities this month.
"Our ongoing investigation into this issue is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators," reported to the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the public informed that the RBS had provided e-mail records and instant messages that had been received and sent by its former trailer to the British regulatory body, the Financial Control Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left the RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted leave to his current position as head of European post-exchange bidding at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of the European post-tender at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher & apos; s short-term contact group included bankers from Barclays and Stigroup, according to the persons concerned.
UBS Bank reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said that it was investigating the alleged currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulatory bodies in the world - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antimonopoly Authority Weko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are considering allegations that bankers have conspired to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal checks or received requests for information from regulatory authorities, said persons familiar with the situation.
Banks have been looking at instant reports and e-mails over the years in search of cases.
The news about the tests has been leaked by the activities of the trading units of investment banks, which have been one of the largest sources of income in recent years, but has been difficult this year, given that low currency volatility has reduced the opportunities for merchants.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by saying that a large and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say it is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the large amount of daily currency market tenders, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trade platforms and the increased use by banks of their domestic platforms means that "you can start to influence the market at a very small price."
This news came on the same day, when Credit Suisse announced that he had fired one of the traders in his stock bid department of the London Exchange this week, after he had lost almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperates with its regulators.
"We are sure that the trailer acted alone and that this issue was localized," Credit Suisse reported.
The Supreme Court upheld the Obama Health Act.
The U.S. Supreme Court today held that Barack Obama's familiar health-care law is a constitutional one, which is a major victory for the Obama administration.
By a vote of 5 to 4, the judges decided that separate regulations under the Patient Protection and Accessible Health Act, requiring citizens to acquire health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine, were constitutional in accordance with the Government & apos; s tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the Court, while Judges Skalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were against.
The Court also retained the remaining sections of this 2,700-page law and further held that the requirement of the Health Act that states should improve compliance with the Medicaid programme, or that they would lose all federal funding for the Medicaid programme, was not unconstitutional.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Business have filed an action to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 round of primary elections, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is the reason for the discord?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the "Open Pool," politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Some of the proposals were made: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because it is a game that is one of scandals and discord.
The Speaker, Sergei Naryshkin, recalled the recent events in Birulev and said that, in order to reduce the "level of social tension," politicians and the media must be correct in their statements.
He must have been referring to a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinovsky, who, in a television show, threatened to round the Caucasus with barbed wire if they didn't want to limit their fertility...
All speakers also spoke of measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and of measures to harmonize relations among the peoples of Russia, which gave the debate a sense of urgency.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Birulev were "a model conflict that could be predicted," but "we have too many people and institutions responsible for these questions," and seven nuns have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe had long practised for migrants, was, in the opinion of the public, a failure, and it was necessary to find its way.
History Yuri Petrov has placed great hope in a new single history book.
"A guide on the history of the country's peoples must be created, so that the students in Tatarstan know what the people are living in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zuganov proposed that "calls for dismemberment of Russia" be criminalized: "If you say on the radio that you have to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Girinovsky was very hard to "not to burn."
As usual, he accused journalists who put sick and acute national problems into public debate: "There is little to say in the dust!"
The leader of the "One Russia" faction, Vladimir Vasiliev, immediately advised journalists to conclude a "charter" and to agree to speak carefully on the subject, and then the same commitments could be made by politicians.
We have some 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order is generally established, Mr. Vasiliev said.
As an example, he cited a law that held regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-national peace on their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichenko did not have the joy of this law: it does not "have a clear idea of what the adaptation of migrants is, its mechanisms and its limits.
Thus, the scope of these powers will be treated differently by the actors.
In addition, municipalities do not have the necessary staff to deal with such complex issues, lack the resources, and the guidance they could use does not give them...
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities, Gajimat Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special agency with the name "Ministry of National Security," which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s led a similar agency, which was subsequently abolished, opposed.
It is sufficient to have at the federal level a special person, "Minister without Portfolio," to be contacted if anything.
"We are walking on the edge, the shells are raging around, it is very important for representatives of different ethnic and religious groups to stand together against provocations, and this work must be well informed," said the representative of the RPC on relations with the Society of All Forms of Chaplin.
The State & apos; s neutrality with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious ideologies, should not be, in its view.
Oleg Nilov then took the discussion into the unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan need to be found, but they are pushed on the wrong path, on the wrong road," he said.
"The wrong road" is the development of football: "The football player is being beaten by the whole crowd, the flags are burning, the comrades are stoning each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another sport called rugby...
"There will be no equal to them in the world in this form of sport!" the reference was very hot.
There will be no one to play in the rugby in the Caucasus! - Mr. Girinovsky immediately intervened.
You're gonna offer them some more kerling!
We need to know the country's characteristics, it's like loading "The Ducker" to offer... "
In Yaroslav, the members of the Moscow club, during a game with the local club, were distinguished at the podium.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
The head of the monitoring and disciplinary committee of the RFF, Arthur Grigorianz, reported that Kuban was fined 500,000 roubles and transferred football from the House to Ce's correspondent, Philippe PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Red Dari Club were imposed for the burning of the flag of Dagestan by the fans at the rostrum during the 14th round of the home game against Anji.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a man from the RFF.
We've been researching all available materials.
A fine of 500,000 roubles is imposed for the illegal behaviour of the Kuban audience.
Google, Samsung, Huawei companies have been sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent claims against mobile phone producers on Thursday, including Google, whose price it held at the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which bought $4.5 billion of Nortel's patents, filed a patent violation claim with the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is charged with violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help to compare key Internet-based search words with their respective advertising, and are found in the claim, which is the basis of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not available and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones operating on the operating system Android from Google, which is strongly competing with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial $900 million price for Nortel patents.
Google raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering a whole $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel Consortium & apos; s patents case to the Rockstar Consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a part of which was the Motorola & apos; s patent library.
"Despite a failed attempt to obtain on auction the patents that are the subject of the claim, Google has violated and continues to violate them," referred to in the lawsuit.
Rockstar requires increased compensation from Google, as he claims that the violation of the patent rights by Google is intentional, as claimed.
In Egypt, the first freely elected President takes the oath
Mohammed Mursi takes the oath, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Mursi promised "a new Egypt" when he took the oath of being the first freely elected President of the country to replace Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
In his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi was also the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath to 18 judges in black mannies in a court building on the Nile Bank, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi during a ceremony that was broadcast live on State television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American entity from the Muslim Brothers, a fundamentalist group that, most of its 84 years of existence, was a prohibited organization that targeted the hard actions of successive Governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police officers when Mursi arrived with a small convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to welcome the new President, and, unlike the Mubarak presidential podcast, the movement was stopped for only a short time to pass his convoy on a usually vibrant road linking the centre of the city to the southern suburbs.
Although Mursi was ridiculed as a non-charismatic "spare wheel" "" Brothers, "his personal prestige has increased dramatically since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists but also for all those who wish to bring to the end the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State today," said Mursi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges in a wide wooden panel room where he took an oath.
Mursi later went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to give his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra performing the State anthem, during which he stood on the "humility" stand.
A military figure from the February-March Hussein Tantavi was present.
His arrival was met with the slogan "The Army and the People - One Hand," which was the scandal of hundreds of people meeting in the main university lecture room.
Founded in 1908 as a pillar of secular education, the University of Cairo in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday, in Tahrir Square, where an uprising came into being that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and promised to return the power of the President, who had been deprived of his post by a military council that had taken cases from a defunct leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, and not before Parliament, as was accepted, it is fulfilling the will of the military, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
The speech of Mursi in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Association of Tumen Automotive Engineers was held at the Yalutorov Automotive Plant.
As part of the event, a new line for the production of electric steel pipes was introduced.
According to the commercial director of Denis Gribanov, a marketing study on the steel market in the Tumen region was carried out in 2011 with the arrival of a new owner.
It has been found that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric welds per month.
It was then decided to change the plant & apos; s profile and to place the equipment on it for their production.
More than 7,000 tons of production have been shipped this year.
The investment in the plant was over 120 million roubles, Denis Gribanov said.
In October, a new facility was launched, thus increasing the range.
The plant produces both a small pipeline profile, which is used for the capital, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large one for the construction industry.
It is planned to reach the production level of 50,000 tons per year, or about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen region.
Despite the transition to another activity, the number of staff in the enterprise has not decreased, now at 157, and the plans for the purchase of new equipment include an increase of more than 50 staff.
The enterprise is being re-trained and the necessary specialists are selected from existing ones.
A new long-cut unit is planned to be introduced next year to be 5 millimetres thick, reducing the cost of products, as well as another plant, at a rate of 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is planning to develop the production of pipes that are used in the housing and public sector.
The management of the enterprise aims to close up to 70 per cent of the needs of the Tumen region for these products.
The Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostrom, in addressing the business managers, advised that more attention be paid to the modernization of the engineering industry.
This is also the result of State support for industry, which includes the reimbursement of interest rates on the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its leasing.
This year, 150 million roubles have been allocated for this purpose, and two thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The latter commission, which will review the grant contracts, shall adopt documents from the enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget is reimbursed for the participation of local producers in international fairs.
The budget for the next year is 150 million roubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing and credit for the acquisition of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to fairs and 3 million will be allocated to energy conservation programmes.
The amount of $72 million is being reduced for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is being made in the south of the Tumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostromov, this form of support will end in the future, as the reason for it was to compensate for the mining tax that oil companies had paid for the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies become direct obligations for the region.
With this in mind, the Government of the regions has given priority to direct support to industrial enterprises rather than to financing the oil industry through them.
Budget assistance will be related to investment projects that will be implemented in the workplace.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the current situation with regard to oil.
The provision of the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage of the industry of the southern Tumen region, and it will be difficult to compete at a price with the Russian middle lane, where the labour force is cheaper.
In addition, there is no clear question of the continuity of the new owner of TNC-BR, Rosoil, which has not yet placed its orders in the Turkmen enterprises.
The implementation agreement for the Uvata project is due to expire in 2013 and no request for an extension has been received.
At present, enterprises in the southern region that specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector cannot form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
The question remains whether taxes from oil produced in the Uwatha region will be paid to the region & apos; s budget or whether they will be paid at the place where the new owner of the deposits is registered.
Tomić will be working 240 hours for an extremist video on social media.
The Leninsky District Court of Tomsk sentenced a member of the city to 240 hours of compulsory work, who had posted an extremist video on the social media, to the RIA News on Friday, a representative of the press service of the Regional Court.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his page on a popular social network, which was placed on a federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was brought against him under the article of the Criminal Code on acts aimed at incitement to hatred and hostility and at degrading human dignity committed in public.
"The Leninsky District Court considered the case in a special manner and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned offence by imposing a penalty of 240 hours of compulsory work," said the agency's interlocutor.
She added that a man had fully pleaded guilty.
Azarov promised the Ukrainians a price collapse after signing an association with the European Union.
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that prices in the country will fall significantly after the country has signed an association agreement with the European Union.
He said that during his communication with the readers of his Facebook page.
I can clearly say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, with the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the free trade zone provision, the level of customs duties on imports from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices would have to fall.
"This is for goods that come from EU countries," Azarov wrote.
For other goods, the effect of the agreement on prices would not be so direct, but would be indirect.
But there should be no price increases, too.
Therefore, reports on the billboards, which have recently come to a large extent in our country, that an association with the EU is an increase in prices, is not exactly the case, or, more precisely, not at all, "summarized Azarov.
Investigators verify information on child abuse in Biisk
On 29 October, the media published a report that a kindergarten teacher in the city of Biysk had locked the child in the basement for educational purposes.
The investigators are currently in the process of clarifying all the circumstances, as well as providing a legal assessment of the actions of the staff of the kindergarten.
After being charged with Yevgenia Vasilieva's durnokussia, he spoke.
Eugenia Vasiliev, who has received close media attention for almost a year, has not yet commented on numerous publications in the press, both on the conduct in Minoborna and on it in person - relations with the ex-Minister of Defence, Anatoly Serdukov, her poetry, and the addiction to valuable things.
However, on 1 November, the figure of the Oronservice case violated silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilieva said, "The objective was, of course, exactly one: to extract from me any negative information against the former Minister of Defence."
There was a blackmail that I had to testify, or I'd be put in prison.
To date, these threats have ceased.
We're going to court, we're going to prove our innocence.
We're 100% sure of the win.
The interview concluded, however, that perhaps the most important thing was that Vasiliev had to say was that she had no good taste.
It may be relevant to refer to the statement by the official representative of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that the collection of paintings collected by the figure holder of the "Voronservice" case had found forgery.
Among the assets arrested are a number of paintings that the mistress, convinced of her deep knowledge of art, has acquired as masterpieces of world art.
However, an artificial examination commissioned by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and were simply cheap counterfeits, "said Markin at the beginning of October.
Some paintings stolen from the Department of Defence...
Then they admitted that they were not stolen from the Department of Defense, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal issues?
I think it's just an infinity, "said Vasilieva.
In question, however, whether she would be guilty of any of the 12 criminal incidents that she was charged with, Vasilieva said: "Of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there was no harm to the Russian Federation in question.
It's just that people are being misled, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the Russian Federation that Vasilieva is avoiding the examination of the criminal case file, the figure-girl's lawyer stated that he and his client "the investigator shall not be given access to the case file."
What led to the revelation of the house arrest of Vasilieva, who had not yet spoken to the press?
Maybe as a woman, she couldn't help but answer the bad-taste charge?
Or is it the right of the "Komsomolki" journalists, who claimed a few days ago that she "went into an even greater trance under house arrest" because of the news of the reconciliation of Anatoly Serdukov and his wife and his return to the family's loon?
The well-known military observer of the "KP", Victor Baranc, in his article "Serdukov returned to his wife?" wrote: "The investigators do not rule out that, after such a shock, she may become more talkative in interrogation."
In the past, Vasilieva has taken on some of the charges of illegal sale of the real estate of the Ministry of Defence.

You think the travel agents have gone back to the past because of the Internet?
In Flight Centre, there seems to be a reverse trend.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and expects record rest income in Australia and the United Kingdom.
This tourist firm now expects its main full annual return before taxation to be between $325 and $340 million, compared with a previous projection of $305 million to $315 million.
If current benchmarks are achieved, this would be a 12-17 per cent increase over the record $290.4 million return received in 2011 / 2012.
The Managing Director, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had earned 8 per cent of its profits in the first half of the year and had started the second half of the year with good performance, especially on a week-long trip to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, we have been working on our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have a record high rate of return in a full year before interest and tax contributions are deducted," he said.
- This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which usually make us the biggest profits. "
In Australia, leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, compensating for a slightly weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in the UK, the Flight Centre's leisure business was good, while corporate clients spent less.
Her business in the United States compensated for the losses incurred during the season of the weak first half of the year and is expected to earn profits for the third full year in a row.
Last night, Flight Centre's shares grew by 3 cents to $38.20.
On 31 October, the Barnaul police officers identified two game rooms.
The first one worked in the industrial district on the street of the Holiday.
At the time of the test, the place was playing a game.
We got 24 machine guns at the club.
Another game club was found in the Lenin district on Anton Petrov Street.
They used 20 game machines here.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation for Barnaul reports that administrative materials have been prepared on the article "Illegal organization and conduct of gambling."
The tech's been seized.
The evidence will soon be sent to the courts of the industrial and Lenin regions of the city.
In Ekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are searching for a criminal who has brutally killed two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
According to the New Region, the bodies of two women with signs of violent death were found on the eve of the day in the Kirov district of the Ural capital, after a fire was extinguished in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on Uralsky Street, in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation for Sverdlovsk province.
The victims were soon identified.
It turns out that they are sisters, one of whom is a 44-year-old Ekaterinburg, and the other is a 33-year-old Orenburg province.
They took off the burned apartment a few days ago.
His investigation was taken over by the Chief Police of the region, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs agencies are working on various versions of the murder, checking the alimies of previously convicted citizens and those who are inclined to do so.
In addition, it is established for what purpose women have taken off their apartment and where they have lived before, what they have done, who they have had a relationship with.
Schools called for more attention to mathematics, orthography and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, the 19th century novel, romantic poetry and modern British art literature from 1914.
The "non-programme texts" will also be presented at the examination to encourage more extensive reading.
A joint course on English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to take a separate language-based examination, with strong recommendations for the selection of English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is expected to produce new curricula in English and mathematics, the first subjects to be radically revised, tomorrow.
It will make changes to other substantive items next year.
A separate regulatory body for the OFQUAL examination will present a revised structure for the secondary school examination, with a new evaluation system and less exchange-rate work.
In the summer, the Minister of Education, Michael Gauv, said that "there was a broad consensus that we should reform our examination system to restore public trust," insisting that school graduation would be "more complex, more ambitious and more stringent."
Research shows that English schools spend less time on mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours per week per quarter) than most countries.
In comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours per year, while in Singapore, students take about 138 hours.
While there would be no formal requirement to devote more time to the math schedule, the coalition sources said that large-scale school math examinations, combined with an increased rate in the rating table, were likely to serve as an incentive for schools to provide additional education on this subject.
The curriculum will focus more on "real-life challenges," including financial mathematics.
Tickets in Hahei will cost the tourists at 2,200 roubles.
As of tomorrow, from the Bliss of Haehah, the tourists will start carrying a ship on an airbag.
For those who want to go to China, that means extra spending.
Puma tickets have traditionally been much more expensive than the heat travel.
According to AmurASSO's reference service, the cost of a regular ticket would be 2,200 roubles.
The passage through the comfort room will cost 2,800 roubles.
By the way, this season, the tickets were not expensive: at the same price, the Puma was used to drive tourists and the last spring, and a year ago, in the fall.
Dmitri Medvedev: The growth rate of the GDP of the Russian Federation is not sufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev considers the Russian Federation to be insufficient to grow its GDP and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of credit for business and by changing the structure of the Russian economy on the basis of innovation, reports Reuters.
We planned to increase GDP in the area of 3% this year, perhaps even a little more.
It's gonna be a little less than 2%.
In the context of the recession in a number of countries in Europe, it seems not very bad, but it is not enough for us, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries and, in general, the pace must be higher in order to develop.
It is now very important that Russian companies, Russian business, receive normal loans at a normal price - the first thing to be done "- emphasized the head of Government.

Travel on dirt, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend receiving hundreds of patients.
There's not a lot of doctors in this West African country, just one per 5,000 people.
Please vote here or through your mobile device.
Dr. George Bwelle is one of the top 10 characters of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 major heroes to make him CNN Hero.
This man will get $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father return to life and again become unconscious, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken hand, but the infection that had emerged spread over the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded himself of himself for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said George Bwell.
If we had money, we would have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
"It's not easy," said Bwell.
You can leave home at 5: 00 in the morning, go to the hospital to be first, but you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some might die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bwelle died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor per 5,000 people.
In comparison, the United States ratio is one doctor per 413.
And even if the Cameroonians could turn to a doctor, many of them would be out of pocket.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the health-care expenditure is private.
"Their only problem is poverty," said Bwell.
- And because of poverty, they can't enjoy their lives. "
In view of the suffering of his father and very many of his compatriots, Bwell was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. George Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and is a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
It also established a non-profit organization, ASCOVIME, which organizes field visits on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 more people go into the vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel to the displaced areas to visit the villages in need.
They don't always have luck.
They've had to push cars through rivers and dirt many times.
But when they come, they're met as real heroes: it's a party with songs and dance and the best space the local people can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed an occasion for a holiday, and Bwell, with his broad smile and unlimited energy, is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the team starts to receive hundreds of patients.
"We take 500 people on every trip," said Bwell.
They come from all over the county, 60 miles from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these day-out clinics provides a variety of health services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can obtain crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - documents that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school building, a municipality or a home; after the procedure, the patients will stand up and go to the post-operation zone to allow room for the next person.
By using a generator to illuminate the operation and sanitation of the equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers are working until early Sunday morning.
It's a slow pace, but the team's commitment usually helps to support village musicians.
"They've been beating drums all night to keep us awake and working," Bwell said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade are going back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations over the past year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that his free hernia treatment would allow him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these clinical admissions, Bwell's surgeon is also working at private health clinics around Yaoundé during the weekend and at the hospital.
It is this second job, he said, that provides 60 per cent of the funding to his non-profit organization; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Cathy O'Malley, a medical student at the second year of Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in Bwell's group.
He's always at the hospital, or he's trying to make money for the organization so he can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in his tasks, it is a possibility that they would never have had a practice at home.
"We were able to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or keep the tools for Dr. Bwell," said O'Malley.
As a second-year student, you would never have had that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often with donated medicines.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, they pay for their food, transportation and training.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon indefinitely.
For Bwelle, almost constant workload is not a heavy test.
To help others live a happy life, to fulfil the promise made to their father is something that gives him great pleasure.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," said Bwell.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can do.
Snowden agreed to testify about Merkel's wire.
The Bundestag of Hans-Christian Strybele met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the interview, the question was discussed whether Snodeen could be questioned as a witness by the Federal Office of the Attorney-General of the Federal Republic of Germany in the case of a possible wire from the German Chancellor's phone by the United States Special Forces.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could be held either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, "Hans-Christian Strebele said," He knows a lot.
And even though the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander, has blocked all of his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, the conditions for his arrival must first be clearly defined.
In the meantime, American legislators are beginning to respond to a US spy scandal.

Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all fields and fields.
This was stated to the journalists by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Makei, at a press conference following a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoğlu, and the correspondent of BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all fields and fields.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we agreed that the two Governments would provide wide-ranging assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts between themselves, "noted Vladimir McKay.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions and provide the best possible assistance.
The Minister also reported that an additional 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had been held in Ankara and that a protocol had been signed.
The parties have developed a road map for Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy agency, is aimed at enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, and the search for new forms and directions of cooperation.
"The record of the last meeting is fully implemented, and I am convinced that the present protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners," he said.
The Foreign Minister of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoğlu, in turn, reported that, at the negotiations, the heads of foreign policy agencies of the two countries had decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and to implement various projects.
In the Minister & apos; s view, the trade between Belarus and Turkey should be increased to $1 billion.
Turkey was also an important partner in the area of investment cooperation, which needed to be further developed, as there was an untapped potential in that area.
Our countries have always had very warm relations, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
And all the necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the success of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey, "noted Ahmet Davutoğlu.
Obama refuses to speak of health care.
In the storm of criticism, President Obama made a fuss about his often repeated, unequivocal promise that "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it."
In view of the fact that hundreds of thousands of people have been notified of the termination of services from their providers, the Republicans have in recent days criticized the President for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama made some of his original public promise.
"Most people with health insurance who work can keep it," he said in his statement in Boston.
With regard to what he referred to as a "news" on the end of service delivery, Obama called on the notified Americans to look for other market options.
Most people will be able to obtain better, more comprehensive health insurance schemes at the same price or even cheaper than anticipated.
"You'll get better terms," he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may have to change plans because they do not meet the new standards required under the Law on Access to Health Care.
"Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Sibelius in a statement before the energy and trade committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Law on Access to Health Care, said that the launch of the Internet sales site has been "horrifying bad" since October.
"I'm as upset and angry as everyone else," she said.
- I really want your trust back. "
The irritated Sibelius dropped this phrase, which was captured by an on-line microphone sitting behind her in a room yesterday after a heated debate with a member of the House of Representatives, Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, on whether she was obliged to join Obama's health-care programme.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the "architect" of the law on affordable health care had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance for the acquisition of the plan through the HealthCare.gov, which she now imposed on millions of Americans.
The Rosbalt Agency has withdrawn media status for non-censorship.
On 31 October, the Mosgorcourt decided to invalidate the licence to register the Rosbalt agency, which is written by "Lenta."
The removal of the status of the media agency was insisted by Roskomnadzor on systematic and gross violations of the media law.
In the course of the trial, an unpleasant precedent had been set: the court had considered it possible to close the media, in fact denying the publication the right to make a counter-argument.
What's Rosbalt?
The "Rosalt Information Agency" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the Agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and operated as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000's, the agency was on the list of the most well-known private Internet media in Russia.
However, Rosbalt has always taken a rather specific niche: the core of exclusive publications has been (and are still) noted by agencies with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Discussions on the proximity of the publication to the security structures continued throughout the Agency & apos; s life.
While Rosbalt had an extensive base of sources in various agencies, it was also suggested that the project was led by Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Victor Čerkesov.
However, the role of Chaplina in Rosbalt's leadership is not fully clear: it is most often called "project manager."
The Agency's Director-General is Laris Afonina, and the editor-in-chief is Nikolai Ulyanov.
Rosbalt has not been listed in the federal media ratings recently, either in quotation or in audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the Russian media site attendance rate, based on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the web site is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), and the monthly audience is about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular material in the last five months are notes of the Kremlin's helplessness with Ukraine, the death of a soloist of the King and Shut group, and pogroms in the capital of Birulev.
The conflict between Rosbalta and Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the media law entered into force, prohibiting journalists from engaging in non-censorship.
The department found a prohibited lecture in two video videos published on the Agency's website ("Jigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot").
The future parties are described in different ways.
Rosbalt was accused of a gross and systematic violation of the media law on the basis of the video found and requested the court to obtain a licence from the agency.
Rosbalta stated that the agency's claims were wrong: first, the roses were not editorial material, second, the mother's words were cloaked, and third, immediately after the prevention, they were removed from the site.
The Agency & apos; s representatives appealed against Roskomnadzor & apos; s claims before the World Court - and when the Mosgorcourt accepted the Roskomnadzor claim on 22 October 2013, these complaints were still pending.
However, 25 of the world's judges had already ruled against Rosbalta: the editor-in-chief, Nikolai Ulyanov, had been found guilty of violations of the Code of Administrative Offences and had been fined 20,000 roubles, 10,000 for each video.
This is clearly the case with the outcome of the proceedings before the Mosgorcourt - if you give up the thought that the outcome could have been decided before.
On 31 October, the court decided to invalidate Rosbalta's registration certificate, effectively depriving the media agency of its status.
It is not possible to say that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The Agency supported the members of the State Duma (a statement to the head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Jarov, signed 26 deputies on 10 October; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the Commission).
The President of the Russian Journalists & apos; Union, Vsevolod Bogdanov, the President of the Moscow Journalists & apos; Union, Pavel Gusev, and the President of the Presidential Human Rights Council, Mikhail Fedotov, have said that it was not necessary to close the publication.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the Roskomnadzor authorities even provided him with some assurance that the case would not reach the withdrawal of the licence.
The Rosbalt trial has shown that it is more secure under whose jurisdiction it is to be a media in Russia today that is a big question.

This first phase of Damascus & apos; s disarmament has been completed the day before the deadline.
Prior to 1 November, Syria was to destroy production and other support facilities designed to prepare for use by the BBC.
The destruction of the stocks of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, the toxic substances are currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent them from being repaired.
The next milestone is mid-November: by that time, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of already existing stocks of toxic substances.
There are a lot of questions.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully verified by the Western Intelligence Services.
They would be willing to advise the inspectors on new facilities for verification if they were to suspect that Damascus was not fully frank.
The US believes that the attack was carried out by regular forces.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community has demanded that the Syrian leadership, in accordance with an agreement reached through Russia, destroy or unoperate all facilities for the production and filling of shells, poisonous gases and liquids.
Now that this phase has been completed, the next step should be the destruction of the already existing chemical weapons of the Syrian army.
It is expected that there may be more than 1,000 tons of nerve-paralytic poisonous substances, boiler gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
Its destruction requires that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities first agree on a timetable for action - two weeks to do so.
The head of field operations of the OPCW, Jerry Smith, stated to the BBC that his inspectors "personally observed the destruction of equipment."
"They no longer have the capacity to further manufacture or mix chemical weapons," he said.
The OPCW statement stated that the inspectors had visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and had found that the shells and poisons were either destroyed or unserviceable.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, as stated in the document, but the equipment from there has been transferred and verified by OPCW experts.
According to Smith, the destruction of the chemical-warfare infrastructure was "particularly difficult," as it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, the time for the inspectors to celebrate was not yet available - they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented recognition that United States espionage has "gone unproperly far"
John Kerry has shown a relaxation of US surveillance tactics by making an unprecedented recognition that in some cases, US espionage has "gone unproperly far."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being "on a pilot" at the time Edward Snowden was exposed to the spying activities of the NSA.
These leaks of information have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said, "There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, have actually taken some of the things that are happening on the machine-pilot, because such an opportunity already existed - both during the Second World War and during the very difficult years of the cold war, and of course on 11 September."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the US government to recognize that US espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no one had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it has gone far too far.
The President is determined to shed light on this issue and to explain himself to people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one is feeling abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process. "
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted for good reasons and that his surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We work in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow up people and attack Governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We were actually preventing the crash of aircraft, the bombing of buildings and the killing of people, because we were able to find out about these plans in advance. "
In the meantime, United States legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to the alleged US espionage abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue their joint counter-terrorism activities with the United States, said the President of the Senate's European Subcommittee on Thursday.
The Senator from Connecticut State, Chris Murphy, said that he had spoken with members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration with the surveillance carried out by the National Security Agency.
"It is indeed important for the United States national security interests that Europeans remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorism efforts," said the Democrat Murphy, who is a first-term member of the Senate's international affairs subcommittee on European affairs, in an interview from Washington.
- And I'm going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programmes. "
The news that the NSA had collected millions of phone records in Europe had worsened relations with some US allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata that the NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other presentations included documents published by Snowden that showed that the NSA was monitoring the German Chancellor's mobile phone, Angela Merkel, as well as some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence, James Klipper, protected the spy activities against the allies as necessary and said it was a common case on both sides.
Against this background, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit by members of Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be presented in the coming days.
He said that the travel programme was still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the visit was to help improve relations, he said that some "hard-core" would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people about what spy programmes they had used for many years.
"While we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to accept the fact that we are not the only ones who do intelligence," said Murphy.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry must go to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address the challenges of hostility with regard to the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence activities.
The influence of prison staff will increase in the new composition of the public monitoring commissions
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new members of the public monitoring commissions (CCCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If a vote is taken, the power lobbyists will increase their influence.
The LLC is a public body that monitors the conditions of detention in places of detention.
The cases of Sergei Magnetic and Leonid Rizzazhaev, the excitement in the Kepian colony - it is through the JC that most of the reported incidents are reported in prison.
The control of the JMC is being fought between human rights defenders and the law enforcement lobbyists.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the JMC, I suggested that the selection criteria be the experience of human rights.
"He was not accepted, and they set up lists without a criteria," Valery Borchev says.
Borzhev is the current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, the entire Russian structure of human rights defenders working on prison issues.
As a member of the State Duma, he had drafted a law regulating the activities of the Java.
The Council of the OP should vote in favour of the composition of the LLC in 43 regions of the country.
There are fewer than 1,000 applicants for 1,800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Kabarino-Balkaria, competition was not possible due to the lack of candidates.
The OP promises to arrange for the pre-recruitment of vacant seats.
The Moscow NCC is one of the few competition commissions, even though the new membership will have 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borzchev, the current composition of the capital commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 members of the police force, and in the option that is on the vote in the OP, the ratio is changed by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders were invited to attend the capital commission.
However, a representative of the "Battle Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin may be reconstituted.
He has been a member of the FLC for three years, but he has never visited a prisoner.
Borzhev believes that, by appointing his President of the JLC, the law enforcement officers will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not rule out collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the promotion of the security forces is coordinated by member Anton Zvetkov of the LLC, who is the head of the Russian Officers, an organization that is responsible for the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies at the end of the run," said the RBC daily Anton Cvetkov.
He denied lobbying for the promotion of any lists and said that he was not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested opposition.
According to Tsvetkov, he had no interest in the list he was currently voting for in the OP.
It is considered a form of pressure to be a public information.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the police force in Cambodia.
Her former leaders will be suspended because of last year's kopian unrest.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the management of the local commission had ignored the problems of the prisoners.
But the LLC Rostova-na-Don can move from human rights defenders to the security forces.
A human rights defender, the President of the local commission, had been found to be one of his opponents from the new lists, even though in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber had excluded him for unethical behaviour.
The lists of the Moscow and European Commissions of Borzhev consider "revenge for Kopisk."
The Toloconnikov's revelations did not affect the Mordovia LLC, which is considered a "force," but only one human rights defender wanted to be included in the new staff, and she had not even accepted the documents for the competition.
Member of the Board of the OP, Nikolai Swanidze, told RBC daily that he had voted against the proposed list because he was outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-na-Don.
He sent his position to other members of the Council.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev said that he had voted in favour because he liked the proposed Moscow list.
Co-ordinated the preparation of the lists of the JCs by Deputy Secretary of the OP Vladislav Grib, also a staff member of the Institute for Research and Research of the FSIN.
The Grib told the RBC daily that it did not consider it appropriate to divide candidates for human rights defenders and members of the security forces and did not agree that the chairpersons of the commissions had sufficient authority to impede the work of its members.
The mushroom is not willing to predict the outcome of the vote of the Board of the OP.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
An Australian woman filed an appeal against a prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in a prison on the island of Phuket for a false claim that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, had appealed against the sentence and had been released on bail.
Stevie Rochel Bamford was initially found guilty by the Phuket Provincial Court on 15 June of a false action following a Thai police report that a local taxi driver had attacked her on the night of Sunday on 10 June, while two other men held her.
However, the security footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after her Australian boyfriend had broken up.
The Phuket police questioned Bamford within two days before she confessed to having fabricated the story.
She was held in local police cells prior to trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days & apos; imprisonment at a general-regime detention centre on the outskirts of Phuketa, rather than at an adult women & apos; s prison.
She is the daughter of a former player of the Australian League, Peter Tanks, who has applied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for assistance from her daughter.
Tanx told the Sunday Telegraph of the Pacific that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the well-being of its daughter and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
"It was obviously an alarming time, but we hope that she will return home safely as soon as possible," said Tanks.
Bamford appealed his sentence and was released on bail at 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently holding her leave in the Krabi resort zone in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford currently represented a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could result in the court increasing her sentence for up to two years and forcing her to serve her sentence in an adult prison.
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michel Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its damaged tourist image, leading to a acquittal.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Yeltysheva," translated into French.
We will recall that this novel was the finalist of four prizes: "Clear Polana," "Russian Booker," "National Best Seller" and "Big Book."
Last year, a writer for the book was awarded a cultural award from the Government of the Russian Federation.
Roman Senchin is a clear leader in the generation of the current 30-year-old and 40-year-old prozaic.
Virtually every publication of its hard, modern life-related stories and agenda is a source of intense debate among critics in a wide range of areas.
It can be argued that the articles collected together on Senchin's prose and public opinion, reviews of his books and magazine publications create an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s until the beginning of the 2010's.
In the discussion of "one of the most controversial contemporary writers," according to the criticism of Sergei Chupriannin, it is said, for the most part, that its participants understand the word "literature," as the present and the future, not only our words, but also our lives, see.
Unfortunately, the length of the book did not allow for the inclusion of most articles and reviews from regional media and blogosphere.
The analytical and review articles are generally reduced under "Abzatz..."
