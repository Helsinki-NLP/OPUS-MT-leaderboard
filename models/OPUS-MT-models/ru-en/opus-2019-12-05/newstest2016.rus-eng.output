The social card of a resident of the Ivanovskaya region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the maintenance of a public passenger transport benefit.
Since 24 September, there has been a change in the arrangements for the granting of preferential travel to citizens, using the social card of a resident of the Ivanovskaya region.
According to the Russian Government's press service for the Ivanov region, the changes provide for the maintenance of a public passenger transport allowance and bring the social card intersettlement scheme into line with the requirements of Federal Act No. 161 of the Federal Republic of Korea on the National Payment System.
The social card of a resident of the Ivanovskaya region is, however, recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changing.
For example, the replenishment limit is now set not on travel, as was the case before, but on cash, with winter and summer periods - not more than 400 roubles in winter, not more than 800 roubles for the current month during the summer period.
Social card holders will now need to track the balance of money rather than the number of travel that remains.
The cost of a favourable travel for citizens would be 1 / 2 of the rate applicable to the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The social card schedule remains the same, from 24 to 23 of the current month.
The new social card will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to maintain a detailed account of the expenditure on the social map to the extent that it is accurate to the kopeks.
In addition, it is possible to refund the stated but unexpended funds.
In addition, the interpayments with carriers are becoming transparent, as now half of the cost of travel is paid by the national and the same amount refunds the carrier to the budget.
No commission will be charged for the application of the money card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Road and Transport of the Ivanovskaya Region, reported that more than 33 million social map visits had taken place in the region in 2014, and almost 25 million in 2015.
In the regional budget, over 470 million roubles are provided for the provision of preferential travel for citizens using a social card.
As at 1 September, there were more than 312 million roubles for this purpose.
During a 911 call, a teacher is admitted to killing a friend.
During a 911-voice call, almost without trembling, a university teacher, Shannon Lamb, told the police that he had shot his friend and that they needed staff who would have come to their house.
Lamb stressed that there was a "dog" in the house who was alive but probably upset, and said that the contact of the family members of the deceased could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss's body and a note that was dull on a white sheet of linen paper: "I am very sorry, I would like everything back, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," said the note, according to representatives of the bodies signed by Lambom.
There was no indication that Lamb, who had conducted two online courses at the University of Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had been able to travel 300 miles to a university campus, where the police believed that he had shot all the distinguished history teacher Ethan Schmidt at the doorstep of his office.
The Chief of Police of the Delta University, Lynn Baford, reported that the university had heard about the shooting at 10: 18 in the morning.
He reported that Lamb made that true call in 911 shortly after.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities were still trying to make one picture of the motives behind the Lamba.
The information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as by students and staff who knew him, helped to portray a talented but possibly concerned teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gothier, where Prentiss died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in his book, in which he expressed his appreciation for the "beautiful people" with whom he had intersected in his teaching life.
Both of them were teaching at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures on both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well of Lamb, Brandon Bivers, said that he also seemed alarmed and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb, at the end of the 2014-15 school year, had told him about his struggle with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to give him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
He only taught two online courses this year.
Recent changes in university recruitment rules meant that the degree of a doctor who Lamb had so hard to obtain would not guarantee him an automatic teacher.
The president of the University, William Laforge, reported that he did not know anything about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "obviously Mr. Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions Lamb can't answer anymore.
The police attacked Lamba after he escaped from campus when he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a 38-caliber-long-loaded gun in the back of the house, one mile south of his parents' home in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, told the Coroner of Washington Metel Johnson County.
His car with a working engine was still on the access road.
It was never clear why Lamb came to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
The Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at a university with 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12000, in 2009, and taught geography and teaching.
He received a doctorate in teaching in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamba's long-standing friends described him as a smart, charismatic and fun man.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15, and Lamba was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a great old guy who for years tried to teach her how to play guitar.
In those years, it was successful for women.
All the girls were there when he was there, "said Harston, who is now 40, and who lives in Jackson, the suburbs of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss, at the time of the events, must have met for a while.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there's no record of their marriage registration.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gothier in a brick house, the other side of which is on the channel.
According to the police, there's nothing wrong with the dog.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Sean O'Steen, reported that they had divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends, and that they had a daughter who was 19 years old.
"She's completely depressed," told O'Steen about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said he didn't meet with Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Steen told me his daughter wrote music and sings.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Schaffer, a bartender, and a co-ordinator of the entertainment programs at The Julep Room, a high-profile bar on the outskirts of Gothier, said that he had last seen Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb had finished playing guitar and a sponge for a few visitors.
Nothing suspicious has been observed.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were having fun and making fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very smart.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, held seminars for freshmen and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three little children.
He attended the University of Kansas in Empire and was President of the Student Brotherhood and Student Self-Government.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, participated in the candlelight memorial on Tuesday night.
The wife of Schmidt Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforge.
The crisis is over.
It's a recovery day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are being reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped the authors of Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus, in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana, in New Orleans.
The material was edited in response to a police statement that Lamba & apos; s call to service was 911 after Schmidt & apos; s murder, and that, although Lamb was talking about Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, it was not confirmed that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less staff for the season.
Toys R Us states that he will not hire as many staff for the holiday season as he did last year, with a child toy and goods rider making sure that he will provide staff and temporary staff with more hours of work.
The company reports that it is planning to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and wholesale bases throughout the country, less than the 45,000 that were hired for the 2014 season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would start interviewing the applicants this month and increase the number of staff from October to December.
While the purchase season is still a few months away, the purchase season is growing closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to have sufficient staff in shops and to sell, deliver and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox is kidding about a "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also significant for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in a movie theater waiting for members of the royal family to arrive, and I noticed that the place next to me was free, and then I had a feeling that Princess Diane would be sitting next to me," he said in the trailer to the soon-to-be documentary "Back in Time."
The movie starts, and then I think I'm literally at the distance of my arm and one fake scent from a date with Princess Welsh.
"Back in Time" - a documentary on "Back to the Future" - includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemecis and executive producer Stephen Spielberg.
The film "Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"For me," Spielberg says, "is the greatest movie of time travel ever made."
"Back-to-Time" will be available on VOD, DVD, and in some cinemas in October.
The Head of the United Nations states that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in response to Russia's military support to Syria, states that there is no "military solution" for almost a five-year conflict, and the increase in weapons will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The United Nations Head once again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to come together and support inclusive negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon stated at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the differences in the Council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, "made the situation intractable."
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they had shown in addressing the issue of the Iran nuclear programme and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 survey results that show that Donald Trump is not a joke
Some have tried to put a provocative label on him.
The others got away from him, taking him as a joke.
And some people want a scandal.
But as some Republicans try to sever Donald Trump's high position in the polls, they have not (yet) done so.
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have shown the advantage of Donald Trump in two-digit numbers, and some are beginning to ask seriously what this means for a real estate magnate in terms of the chance of being nominated.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to nominate a Republican party.
The experts point out that, at that time, in 2011, Rick Perry gave up his most popular German Kane, none of whom won one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in general elections.
But external groups, such as Jeba Bush's Political Activism Supercommittee, and the growth club's economic conservative group recognize Trump's unrelenting power and start to deliver their dollars to overturn it.
These are some of the survey numbers that indicate that real estate is not just an intermediate phase:
It's a 180-degree sympathy rallies for Trump.
Immediately before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had been positive about the real estate magnate.
By mid-July, that was 40 per cent.
This was 52 per cent at the beginning of August.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans are positive about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators take precedence at the initial stages.
The Qinnipiac survey in Iowa last week found that 60 per cent of the Republicans there were positive about Trump.
Two thirds of those who voted for the GOP would have put Trump on the table as a candidate.
In a CNN / ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they were either "happy" or "happy" if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "upset" if he were a candidate.
Only Ben Carson is about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be "happy" against 40% of those who say the same about Trump).
Next on the level of admiration?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans say they will be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if Jeb Bush is a candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperature is a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his bravery and insults, 52 per cent of Republican voters across the country think that the magnate has the right temperature to be president, as the ABC News / Washington post survey on Monday showed.
The same figure appears at the country's first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of the Republicans think he has the same person who could be the chief commander, according to Quinnipac last week.
However, 44 per cent think he is not an effective person, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperature is not appropriate for the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to this thought.
When they wear their know-how hat, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
In question, who is the most likely winner of the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was a favorite, according to CNN / ORC last week.
This is not the case when four out of 10 put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters have never had the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported a possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters find the Trump campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans were all around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of all the others.
Some know-how points out that this variation is likely to benefit Trump, while non-supporting Trump is equally distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in a one-on-one hypothetical competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is almost always supported by the majority.
He's 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio, 14 points, Walker, 15 points, Jeb Bush, 19 points, and finally, Rand Paul, John Casić and Chris Christie, 33 points.
He's got a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate that's going around him?
Ben Carson was running out of business for 19 points in a one-on-one hypothetical competition.
A little over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their mind.
A new CBS / NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only more than half of the voters supporting Trump say they are confident of their voices.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, Trump's most intense competition at the moment - with a colleague who is an outsider, a neurosurgeon, Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have changed their mind are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" two months ago in his campaign speech, the topic of immigration has become the most relevant in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's disdain will turn key Latin American voters away from the Republican party and prevent the rebranding.
But according to an ABC / Post survey on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, as long as immigration is receiving universal attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
The Government's disenfranchisement is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on support from about half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Shine of 10 Republicans on Monday's new ABC / Post survey say they want a political outsider rather than a man with government experience.
And they're also offended at Washington.
The Des Moines Register / Bloomberg survey in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with the Republican activities in Congress, with 54 per cent "unsatisfied" and 21 per cent "furious."
The Government will decide the fate of the pension indexing in October.
The Vice-Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Olga Golodec, stated that the Government was currently looking for options to implement the Pension Inflation Act in 2016 for real inflation, and was transferring it to the WG.
She noted that a solution should be found by 8 October, at the time of submission of the next year & apos; s budget draft to the Government.
In addition, the Kabmin is discussing the option of extending the decision to freeze the Russian accrued pension.
The hungry noted that the amount of pension savings was 350 billion roubles.
About the same is the cost of indexing pensions in full for the following year.
According to the Vice-Premier, there is no final solution to the question of who should pay the contributions for non-working citizens.
A hungry person believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not, however, belong to socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not fair that society pays for it.
The media had previously reported that two options for balancing the State budget were being considered in the Kabmin.
Why do you often get annoyed and blush for centuries?
Tatiana Levashova, an ophthalmologist, says:
Our centuries are the spikes that protect the eye apple from the many small particles that sit on them.
By forgetting the regular cleansing of the century, we often contribute to the development of bluffarite.
The exit is simple:
Do not wipe your eyes with your dirty hands, and carry with you a special wet napkin for the age.
At least one or two times a day, clear the edges of the century from the harmful substances that have been accumulated in them during the day.
The cleaning procedures also need to be supplemented by warm compresses with the loins of medical herbs (shalfei, romaks), which incinerate the thick secret of the salon gland, and then by the massage of the edges of the century, which should be carried out by circular movements of the fingertips;
You don't use the alcohol-containing means by washing out the makeup.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and make the secret of the sled gland even more difficult.
Pyongyang claims that the Korean nuclear authorities have created an atomic warhead.
The North Korean authorities reported that the country's main nuclear reactor, the Yongbene nuclear complex, was "fully operational."
This was reported on the country & apos; s Central Telegraph Agency website.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to "US aggression and nuclear threat," and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "in both quantity and quality."
The last nuclear test was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
However, no plans have been reported to resume the full operation of the reactor since then.
Pyongyang claims that he was able to create an atomic warhead.
The DPRK has also carried out a number of mid-range and short-range missile tests and has written polit.ru.
Girinovsky demanded that the reference to the fraternal peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
The LDDP leader, Vladimir Girinovsky, believes that the reference to the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said so during a meeting of the State Duma, reporting "Russian News Service."
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can't stand," said Girinovsky.
The delegate is of the view that it is necessary to remove all the four-tier lines that contain this line:
In the summer of 2014, Girinovsky stated that the current anthem should be changed to "God, King of the Warehouse," and the Russian tricor should be replaced by an imperial flag, writing polit.ru.
Assad called on all forces to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad called on all forces to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe is to deal with the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the root causes of the problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the essence of the refugee issue," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to reach consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are not possible as long as people die while the bloodshed continues and people are not fully safe.
"Thus, we can reach consensus, but we can't realize anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad stressed.
It will be recalled that some 500,000 migrants, including from Syria, have arrived in the European Union during this year.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world was the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that thousands of members of the extremist group "Islamic State" may be among the migrants entering Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization prohibited in Russia may use the situation to establish their cells in the EU for terrorist activities.
The people of the German city had organized a holiday for refugees.
In the past month, Germany had become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it had recently strengthened border control to contain them.
The authorities estimated that some 800,000 migrants would arrive in Germany before the end of the year, although some experts referred to significant numbers.
More than 90,000 refugees have arrived since the beginning of September.
A BBC correspondent, Jenny Hill, visited Darmstadt, whose residents provide migrants with a very warm reception.
Jeremy Corbin debuts the Prime Minister at the session.
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, the Prime Minister is looking forward to his debut at the session.
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon address the Prime Minister for the first time at the session, with the first time with the forces of David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will make the first of the six questions in the afternoon; he will likely be closely followed by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He made a "less theatre and more facts" appeal at a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could miss some meetings by leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbin & apos; s first parliamentary test as leader; it will take place after the appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Congress of the Tred-Union on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour leader to remain silent during the national anthem on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has led to criticism by a number of conservative members of Parliament and has become the subject of several advanced articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing a public anthem has attracted attention.
Mr. Corbin's spokesperson stated that he "stood in honour" and recognized "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in Battle for Britain."
However, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, a member of the shadow cabinet, told Newsnight at BBC 2 that he would advise the leader of the Labour to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbin's team, expressing differences on economic, defence and international policy issues, while less than one sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant said that political differences were also "boarded" by the Labour Party following the appointment of Mr. Corbin to a European Union post and the Government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Trad-Union Conference that the Labour Party had amended to eliminate the very idea of restrictions as a whole.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Shadow Minister of Labour and Pension, said that there was "complete clarity" in the party that it had been in opposition only to government plans to reduce the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the Labour, with whom David Cameron will meet at the "courier box" in the last 10 years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Leader, who had promised a different approach to policy, said that he had "engaged collective resources" to raise the ideas of Mr. Cameron's questions and had received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from the Ailington North District said that questions to the Prime Minister were too confrontational and that he would refrain from the witty answers and the exchange of colcones, but instead pledged to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economy in the shadow office, would replace him with the Prime Minister when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also suggested that other colleagues should be allowed to take the floor when possible, saying that he had addressed the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Berkow, to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to move away from the political style of a "fair vagina," often associated with the procedure of questions to the Prime Minister, but admitted a few years later that he had not been able to do so.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, questions to the Prime Minister have become a key indicator of the leadership & apos; s views, their ability to run the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics have stated that this has become a cartoon and that it requires extensive reform.
"Detained in Yoburg" Homeless young people who learned from photographers
The Johannesburg Business Centre is a difficult place for the homeless.
But a group of ex-street people found a way to develop a job and make a living.
"I was taken from Yoburg," a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the neighborhood and make money on it.
The BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound sterling is growing as wages increase in the United Kingdom
The pound grew up against the background of the UK's salary growth, with the FTSE 100 index rising due to a proposal to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, British earnings, net of bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent over the same period last year.
The growth rate has been the highest since 2009 and has been met as an earlier postponement of projections for possible increases in quotations.
The pound of sterling increased by more than 1 per cent from the dollar to $1,5505, and by 0.84 per cent from the euro to 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index increased to 6229.21 per cent.
In general terms, SABMiller shares were released, which grew by 20%, thanks to a purchase offer from a competitor of AB InBev.
The deal would bring together two of the world's largest brewery companies by collecting brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's shares grew by 0.9% against the background of encouraging news from a competing group of products of the Richemont class.
The latest data on Richemont sales exceeded all expectations and showed that China's sales - on the key market for Burberry - were again on the rise.
Glencore's shares grew by 5% after a mining giant announced that he had been able to obtain $2.5 billion by placing shares, as was done as part of a debt reduction strategy.
The Mondi paper and packaging group's shares were leading a 4.3% fall in the index after Goldman Sachs reduced the band's rating to "sell."
The JD Sports stock increased after the sports clothing company reported an 83 per cent increase in the return to tax for six months to £46.6 million.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages can be an obstacle to expansion.
The JD Sports Executive Director, Peter Kaugill, says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the cost of labour, he says.
The costs could have had an impact on the JD Sports expansion plans, and he added, which could have meant a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash is launching a bottom-up campaign to combat Aldi's nathic.
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's soaks in South Australia and West Australia.
A bottom-up food provider launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA rivals in South Australia and West Australia in the light of the forthcoming Aldi $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 shops in South and West Australia early next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and in the Adelaide Show.
The campaign is joined by rivals and suppliers of IGA, such as the producer of the Simmo's Dansboro ice cream, who offers a detour at the IGA stores, and shop owners who sell tickets to the South Australian Football League on a discount basis.
Metcash is expected to provide more details of its protection strategy on September 29, the day that this wholesale provider of food, alcohol and economic goods will be spending its annual day on the investor's strategy.
In South Australia and West Australia, the IGA-branded shops account for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show a higher cost-effectiveness than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Purchasers in South and West Australia are known as traditional routes, so the market is more favourable to IGA riders than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in UA and 24 per cent in WA, compared to about 14 per cent in Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of their first stores, taking the volume of sales from all players present, but mainly from independent rivals.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst of Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA rivals could lose $360 million per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, with $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
The loss of food revenues and sales at a high level of constant cost to Metcash could cost companies about 13 million income before interest and taxes were paid, Mr. Kirat considered.
At the same time, Metcash is losing its market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is because a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
In Morgan Stanley, it is estimated that the sale of Metcash will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and by 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the market share of the company from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading stock manager, Hamish Douglas, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, observed at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "could be very likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the board of directors of Metcash contacted Mr. Dusness last week.
The share of IGA in the market has declined from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and Metcash's income from the food business, which the company supplies to some 1,200 IGA riders, has fallen by 43 per cent compared to 2012 due to operational deleverage and the pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually to equate retail prices with those at Coles and Woolworths for a thousand items per week, and helping IGA riders to reconstruct their trading sites, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider choice of firm food.
The Director General of Metcash, Ian Morris, says that price equalization and trade area improvements are gaining momentum, and hopes that the company will achieve an increase in net profits in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanashi Kokkinakisa is supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Tanashi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanashi Kokkinakis has been indirectly affected in a recent scandal around his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more respect for his behavior than criticism, as President Tennis Australia says, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a young man in a talented duet and often called "Special Ks," was unwillingly placed at the centre of attention because of the shameful connection of Kiryos with Stan Vavrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly after that, during a hot qualification match at Cincinatti, the judge on the tower had to take out the Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, twice, and Harrison said, "Vavrinka should have put on the kiryos scapes, and I should have put him on that guy's scapes."
Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a rocket after the cradle in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible US Open defeat, Healy is faithfully protecting Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second after Bernard Tomic in solitary confinement at the semi-finals of the Davis Cup against the United Kingdom.
"I'm very worried about one thing, that is, what Tanashi was brought into the conflict," Healy said.
He really broke a racket when he had his leg on the US Open, but he's not the first player to break a rocket when hope failed, and I know Tanashi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But he actually owned himself very well in a rather provocative situation on the US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he's credible.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfair.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works a lot, he's a great fit for the team, he's never had a problem with other players, he's been respected outside the court, he's actively trained, he's in a great form, he's a very determined and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated in dignity.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiros for the important match that begins on Friday, believing that "mutual consent" is the right way out for all, but counting on a guy from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the game, not on the disputes around [Kiryos]," said Healy.
And I think that Nick has gained power very quickly, as people like Federor and Marray prove, he's growing up in front of the public, he's made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I need to get him out of the focus for a while so he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary is declaring an emergency, closing the border, detaining migrants
By declaring a state of emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on the southern border on Tuesday and detained those who were trying to enter the country illegally in order to contain the flow of migrants entering the country.
There have been riots on the border, with hundreds of migrants on the border territory, which the Serbian authorities have responded with a sharp negative response.
The people who had fled armed violence in their home country had, for an indefinite period of time, broken tents and settled on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries.
However, discontent has increased.
When a police helicopter was round them, the migrants were screaming "Open the border!" and shouting at the Hungarian Special Police.
Some have refused food and water in protest.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared "unacceptable" the return of migrants from Hungary when they were increasingly coming from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not the collateral damage.
It is necessary to negotiate with Brussels and other countries in the coming days, "Ivica Dachic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after a block of 28 countries was unable to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that an agreement would be reached in the future (next month or the end of the year) that EU member States would host another 120,000 refugees, including those from Hungary.
The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Austria, on Tuesday, demanded that an emergency EU summit be convened next week to discuss the immigration crisis that had affected the continent.
Hungary, however, did not hope for early action on the part of Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities more power to act on the crisis, which allowed them to close the roads and expedite asylum cases.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Minister of Vengia, Peter Siyarto, stated that his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence on the border with Romania to close the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had completed the fence on the Serbian border.
A CBS News correspondent, Charlie Dagata, reported that even prisoners were involved in urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary has become the main "narrow" place and crossing point of the EU border for the displaced, many of whom are refugees who are victims of the wars in Syria and the countries of the Middle East.
However, the Prime Minister of the country, Victor Orban, insists that most of the people entering the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, rather than refugees, who are victims of war, who are entitled to protection, and this view is very different from those of other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws that entered into force in Hungary at midnight now make it an offence to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison terms for the accused of trafficking in persons.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declared a state of emergency," said a representative of the Government, Zoltan Kovac, in the southern city of Ségued.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, the Parliament is still required to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters who are at the border have been monitoring the presence of pre-teeth armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Dierdy Bakondi, Orban & apos; s National Security Adviser, reported that 45 persons had been captured by authorized authorities who had tried to cross the border on the border itself, and 15 others inside the country.
They have crossed the border by breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are charged with administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are reconstructing the fence quickly.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia on the Tuesday morning, by barbed wire to block one of the passages.
The disturbances broke out at the main border crossing near the town of Rioske (Hungary), as the Hungarians had placed an office space to allow people to enter the metal container, and the crowd had pushed each other to break in.
Some 20 persons were able to enter, with thousands left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway from Serbia to Hungary and declared no food and water until they were allowed into Hungary.
Elections 2016: The advantage of Hillary Clinton over Bernard Sanders has been halved in the national survey
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit advantage in the Democrats' race for nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now has 47 per cent support for the primary democratic voters (down from 58 per cent), and Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, is supported by 15 per cent of the primary democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the competition in the primary elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that they have decided on a candidate to be supported.
Clinton's supporters are more confident in their choices than they are supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton holds a great deal of advantage among women and the moderate, but that advantage has been reduced.
Her support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind.
The preference given to Clinton by the democratic voters up to the age of 50 has disappeared, and she and Sanders are on an equal footing.
But Clinton still has a great deal of advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton overturned Sanders by a double-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has an advantage of five points in this group.
Almost half of the primary democratic voters across the country say that they would be enthusiastic about Clinton if she had become a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support it only because she was a candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
It may not be surprising that the current supporters of Clinton are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not support Clinton at the moment, views are more controversial - only about a quarter would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48 per cent of the primary democratic voters say they would be enthusiastic about Clinton, a smaller number of Republican voters say the same about their leadership, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked why they want her to be a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), then that it is now the time of a woman president (13 per cent), and that she is the best candidate (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters are also talking about an association that links her to Bill Clinton (9%).
It is also called the question consent and the chance of election.
As the Vice-President is considering potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary democratic voters would like him to join the race - although one third believes that he should not.
When they are asked who they would like to see second among the party candidates, the primary democratic voters are in most cases called Baiden.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say they would have chosen Biden second, that's more than Sanders'.
If Biden decides not to stand for election from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will be increased from 20 points with Baiden to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of the democratic voters see a candidate in Clinton with the best chance of winning a general election; however, that figure fell from 78 per cent last month.
According to this indicator, Biden, with a high second-place lag, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate, has increased.
However, in response to a question that is most important in the candidate, democratic voters choose options other than the chance of being elected.
Similarly, in the past month, none of the candidates from the Democrats or potential candidates is an unwelcome nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most think Clinton, Sanders and Baiden are honest and credible people with good leadership.
Biden of all three is a leader, and Clinton's strong leadership.
Thirty per cent of the primary democratic voters do not see Clinton as honest and credible, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain opinion on it.
The primary democratic voters also generally view the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Baiden as similar.
By all these standards, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
While questions about the personal e-mail box and the Hillary Clinton server continue to be raised by her Secretary of State, most of the primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this did not affect their general opinion of her.
But that's a different story for the American public at large.
Half the Americans are not satisfied with her explanation today, and only about a third are satisfied.
The public & apos; s views on this were divided as early as March, shortly after the story had become known.
Most Americans say that the e-mail debate has not affected their general opinion on Clinton, although 36 per cent say that their opinion on it has deteriorated.
Most of them are Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered honest and credible by its party, it continues to be a problem for her among the registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent consider it fair and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not see Trump as honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump, however, are both given good leadership.
Of the six protestors, Biden, Carson and Bush show the best result in integrity.
Most people see in Sanders more of an honest man than not, but as for Carson, many have no opinion on him.
The error limit for a sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
After a national survey, Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson went straight to Donald Trump in the last CBS / New York Times survey.
The two candidates obtained half the vote in the new poll, leaving all the others in search of support under their feet.
Republican voters all over the country continue to support Trump, whose support rate has increased from 23% in a recent CBS survey held on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson took off from 6% to 23% during the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson was supported in all demographic groups by losing Trump in a group of Republican voters with higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and the Governor of Ohio, John Kasić, have returned with the Governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
The former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Hakabi, and the Governor of Florida, Marco Rubio, are in third place together with 6%.
The error limit for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is 6 per cent plus or minus, which was conducted in September.
A recent CNN / ORC survey, published last week, showed Carson's growth in the polls - showing support for 19% of the Republicans, behind Trump with 32% of the support.
The latest ABC News / Washington Post survey also showed that Trump is far ahead of Carson.
In response to the increase in support for Carson last week, Trump made several critical attacks on a former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday at the time of the closure of the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the brotherhood are charged with the death of a freshman at Baruch College.
About two years after the death of a college student, five people were charged with murder during the ritual of fraternity in the Pokono Mountains in Pennsylvania.
"Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of the New York College Baruca have brutally attacked Chan" Michael "Deng during the September 2013 ceremony and have not taken him to the hospital on time, resulting in his death," they have been reported to the police.
Officials say that a student with blindfolded eyes and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back was pushed several times while he was trying to achieve his target, walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call in 911 when Deng lost consciousness and were waiting an hour before he was taken to the hospital, they were told by the police.
They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Meng, the National President of the Brotherhood, to ask the board, as Chief Chris Wagner said at the press conference.
"At this point, the members of the brotherhood began to hide personal property, essentially, by making the welfare of the brotherhood above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
They couldn't save him, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received several blunt head, torso and thigh injuries.
"Too many families have been affected by the rituals of fraternity, since at least one student has died in them every year since 1970," Douglas Feierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in his statement.
The brotherhood and their members must be held accountable, and that step on the part of the authorities is very important.
The Monroe County jury was in favour of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against a rookie and a criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only individual actors accountable, but if there is an organization that has authorized all this officially or informally, then so is," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruca College has banned brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has removed local secession from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There is an increase in rates, and the "bull market" will collapse, the bond returns will increase and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will be before the offensive, and how long it will continue.
In particular, for the economy, the story does not explain much about time.
The recession took place only 11 months after the first rate increase and for a whole of 86 months.
The severity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, although not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the US Central Bank administration so strongly emphasizes that investors should not focus on when it starts raising rates, but on how much adaptation will take.
In fact, there are a lot of variables in the game.
After all, however, market participants may find that all the fuss around the rate increases is exaggerated.
"The first increase in the Federal Reserve with the onset of a global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the" cheap money "era," was reported by Julian Jesp, the chief international economic expert in Capital Economics, in his comments to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
That does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is a view of how some areas of the economy could respond to historical trends:
As the market has seen in the last month or so, the expectation of an increase in rates can lead to volatility for some time.
When the rate is raised, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"It is not likely that the equity income has been slowed down for 12 to 24 months after the first race, which again is likely to reflect a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the Federal Reserve's rate increases.
More specifically, the market has changed more rapidly over the last about 35 years - about 14 per cent - to the higher rates, remains fairly equal for 250 days (an average increase of 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returns to a normal rate of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the main trade strategy expert in the Nuven Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to be immediately more pronounced at the rate-raising stage, and equity income is beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they are often encouraged by higher rates.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed under conditions that did not exist previously and could accelerate the recession.
Most of the gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point during the period of the high rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, the rate increase since 1950 was only twice the nominal annual GDP below 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6% in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it for a long time, with only 1.5% in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates on such an unstable economic background can be risky and raises the question "will it be different this time," reported in Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to raise the rates of the Federal Reserve system all year, and their views are attached to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
So far, many policy experts and economists believe that FOMC could approve a rate increase at this meeting, futures trade is only a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the rate-increase cycles to date have been in the super-cycle of increasing financial leverage with GDP, which is closing the peaks leading to the recession, very quickly after recovery," the report states.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is now the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, only 74 months and not yet over.
The fixed income has also become unstable, while the market is waiting for an increase in rates, and this scenario is in some ways similar to that for shares.
The fundamental difference is that, for bonds, the effect will be faster than for shares when the Federal System changes the strategic direction.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the return changes the vector as soon as the first rate increase / decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the high-rate cycle, the bond returns immediately fall, "reports Deutsche.
Strategy experts from Charles Schwab believe that high rates will lead to long-term and short-term bond returns being brought together, making the curve more flat.
High-return bonds are often better in this climate, although "we are still afraid of the volatility of returns," as stated in Cathy Jones's study, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal System policy.
"In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are signs that the market has been adapted to a more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have increased, with a more flat rate of return, credit spans have increased, and volatility has increased - all market characteristics, with stronger federal policies.
In general, companies that have a major business in the US will benefit from interest rate increases and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with many debts will be in a worse position, as the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt more expensive in the financial space.
"History shows that" high-quality "shares show efficiency above market within three months of the initial rate increase," Goldman Sachs said in a client report.
Firms with a stable financial situation have been bypassed by companies with a volatile condition, following each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004, on average, by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns, as well as low volatility, have also shown better efficiency than low-quality shares by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
The duty will be a big question.
The high-interest floating-rate companies will be the most lost, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely trading, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
Contributors could also see profits through higher returns, although experts differ in how fast this will happen.
BBC Radio 3, a copy of Classic FM, claims a member of Parliament from Conservatives Andrew Bingham.
Conservative member Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "lower standards"
Proves that she's becoming less and less different from a commercial competitor.
Also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award was just a Bits.
Damien Collins, a parliamentary colleague who struck The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is becoming Classic FM," said the leader of the members of Parliament, encouraging a television and radio company to prove that it is doing anything that commercial companies don't do.
A conservative member of Parliament, Andrew Bingham, also told the BBC leadership that it seems that the public radio station is "stupid" and is becoming less and less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word" simplification "- but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
It also aimed at the BBC Music Awards Award launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which was launched last year, looks like the Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that came to my mind first, where you're actually just copying what's already on the market, "Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC Director General rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial rival when it comes to living music and the education of the audience.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his commitment to living and making music is not really the same as anyone else.
"Also very important, I think, is the interest of Radio 3 in finding new music and promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey claimed that the radio station had to work much more to attract the audience than in the past, because the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of the BBC who was attacked on the heels of commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
A member of Parliament from Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a music show that the BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of £22 million.
See why this programme is often discussed because of the lack of originality and characteristics?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in "typical BBC style."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit in her own home stable" next time she runs a entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the order of the new season The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those who pay the licence fee to other entertainment formats.
The growth in Internet sales slowed as much as possible in August, and it could be Black Friday.
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase of 7 per cent in online sales
Last month, there was the slowest growth since it was observed in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile shopping devices
The experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could have helped to contain the waste.
For about 10 years, virtual shopping has been a boom, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs of a levelling of online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7 per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping costs in August have shown a minimal increase since they were recorded in 2000, with an increase of only 5 per cent.
Experts say that there are now signs of a levelling of online sales after the latest data showed only a 7 per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000, they always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkehi, the editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so under any conditions, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it's on the plateau, and you can see a decline (growth).
The Phenomenon of the Black Friday, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
The experts believe that the buyers could have refrained from buying before the last Friday of November.
In the past year, five times as much as the average number of buyers was in a hurry to get to the computer to make good use of the offer, thus bringing down a number of vendor websites.
The experts believe that the Black Friday, when buyers are in a real fight for a good purchase, could have made people refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by British Retail Consortium, a little over £1 out of every 5 is spent online.
For goods such as television and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through Internet shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of the people buy clothes and shoes online are more likely than in fashion shops on the central streets.
Muslims bury those killed in the fall of a crane in Mecca, and the Ben Laden family is sanctioned
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead on the streets as the first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the accident.
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 persons were also injured after the collapse of the crane
Hundreds of Muslims were all over the streets to bury 29 of the victims who had died as a result of the collapse of the crane on the main mosque of Mecca.
Those who were mainly dressed in white, who were present at the funeral, filled the carriageway to pay tribute to the first of the victims to go on their last journey to the Al-Moissem cemetery.
The sad process passed the sacred place, where only a few days earlier the building crane had hit the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parish.
The bodies were issued for the funeral, and at the same time King Sauditov fined a construction company belonging to Ben Laden's family for an accident that also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 parishioners who were killed in the collapse of the crane in the main mosque were taken to the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Big Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage trip when the crane fell.
Mr. Akram was in the main mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the arrow of the crane raised in a non-functioning crane.
The Arab version of the decree issued by the State Agency Saudi Press states that Bindadin Group is partially responsible for the collapse.
The English version of the news agency did not provide details, but reported that company leaders were not allowed to leave the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out why the crane had fallen into the courtyard of the main mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had come to go to the Hajj this month.
The Bindin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and of inadequate coordination with the meteorological service.
Tens of crane are surrounding the main mosque of Mecca, as part of the extensive construction work being carried out by the Bindadin Group.
The Ben Laden family has for decades been among the close-up families of Saudi Arabia and is leading the largest construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was the son of a traitor, from whom the family would be called out in the 1990s.
The accident took place in strong winds and rains just a few days before millions of people arrived in the Kingdom to take part in a pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in life for every working Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 persons remained in the hospital.
Officials have decided to pay one million rials (about £174,000) to the relatives of the victims and the same amount is irreversibly hurt.
The remaining victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B & Q states that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European small-money masters
According to Veronica Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists.
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals.
At the same time, Kingfisher is closing 60 B & Q stores across the country.

They say that the British are putting away the hammers and the maidens, and instead they hire qualified East Europeans to do the work at home.
If you can handle a hammer or paint the walls, it seems like you're a minority these days.
Because, according to the B & Q company, the British are still hiring a professional master to do a simple job at home.
Veronica Laurie, the new Director General of Kingfisher, who owns a network of home-building services, reported that this trend was followed by a significant influx of qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering services at a minimum cost.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores specialized in the goods for the masters, and to close 60 B & Qs stores at the same time.
Ms. Laurie said that she would like to see more women in the B & Q shops, since eight of the 10 purchase decisions in the store were made by low-sex women.
The majority of staff are currently men.
She said that recent demographic trends, which were characterized by an increase in the number of single-woman households that were more involved in building their homes than in the past, could not be overlooked.
Ms. Laurie said, "Our shops are still mostly male.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on goods are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women at the helm of the leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team, seeking equal numbers of men and women among directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 per cent of managers are women, including the general and financial director.
Ms. Laurie said, "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
It was easy to find suitable women on the board of directors.
After the group took over the costs of closing the stores, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales over six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, who owns the Screwfix and B & Q brands, opens 200 new stores.
Decision time at United States Federal Reserve interest rate
The world is following a meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank, which, within two days, is discussing the adoption of the most important decision - to raise or not a interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that just over half of those who believed that the Federal Reserve would do so last week now believed that it would further damage and maintain the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 per cent.
It is a historic event, since it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve reduced the rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach that the main bank can move from a zero-point point to a process of normalization of interest rates, "said Angel Koudé, a leading official of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The US economy works effectively, the economic recovery adds trillion dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the solution will affect the world economy.
He warned the markets that changes should be prepared, but they were all convinced that all the chances were against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" - hundreds of refugees at the Khorgoš checkpoint at the Serbian-Hungarian border are being scandalized.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for the displaced.
Asylum-seekers are already beginning to explore other options for routes to the European Union.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
The other, through Croatia and Slovenia, to Austria.
According to some information, buses that have taken refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now being sent to the town of Shida on the Croatian border.
The drivers were ordered by the authorities to proceed without stops.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior, Nebojsa Stepanović, assures that his country is doing its utmost to help the refugees, but that its capacity is limited:
Our job is to protect Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to be treated humanely.
But it's already a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to decide, but no country in Europe alone will be able to do so, especially a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade is asking Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Victor Orban is unswerving:
If a person is called a refugee, he must complete the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed into our country either, because it's safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already built a 175-kilometre fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop at this: he plans to build a similar fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Meimarakis has for a number of years been part of right-centric governments, which, in the view of the left, have led the country to a financial crisis.
Now that he is a temporary leader of the New Democracy party, he is challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist, Euronews.
Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
I thank you for inviting me.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by giving up on the SIRIZA coalition, but now, according to the surveys, "New Democracy" has been compared to it in popularity.
What's changed in that time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a surplus budget and prospects for economic growth.
The country now again has a budget deficit and a high unemployment rate.
The investors have left because Mr. Tsipras has run them away.
In the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises made by Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what they promised with what actually happened.
The day-to-day situation has been significantly worse than in January, when the situation has improved, with the majority of Greek citizens.
But you say if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including the SIRIZA.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The fact is, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no accident that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in place, political forces and all ruling parties have come together to implement a programme on which they have agreed without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If you become a new premier on Monday, will you implement this agreement or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece & apos; s movement along the European path, because we are well aware of the devastating consequences that the country & apos; s withdrawal from the EU would have.
Europe is now helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, and we have solidarity funds, a Junker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost if there was no treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Tsipras & apos; negotiation.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government in the first year wants to establish order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all the commitments that have been made that cannot be fulfilled because of the recession can be negotiated again, but only after a certain time.
It would be wrong to believe that, in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we are to return their trust, we must continue the privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, while continuing to benefit from EU financing and the great investment opportunities that we must open up for a better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Tsipras did not present any serious arguments on many of the key political issues that we have found out in discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give an example of farmers' income.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the Ministers of Tsipras had never said so.
That is, Greek ministers were not prepared and poorly informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
If you win the election, you will soon be at one table with Mr. Yunker, Holland, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you say be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, said to them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that before the end of 2014, we tried best to implement the 2012 agreement by circumventing its sharp angles.
We have moved the reforms forward.
Of course, we did not have the necessary determination and speed, but we were acting in an emergency.
The market fell and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price of the Greek government.
I was the Speaker of Parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, which then constituted the Government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key draft laws, we had a functioning parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations outside.
We have succeeded in bringing the country to a normal situation that would have continued to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: The recent weeks have seen a massive flow of refugees in Greece.
What do you think of this situation and of the reaction of the European countries to which these people are seeking?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we have to deal with after the election.
And the reason is that the Government of SIRIZA did not act on this situation as it should.
Such issues should be taken forward, because if you are facing a problem, only emergency measures remain.
And that's what we're in now.
Even the interim government that replaced SIRIZA did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions by the interim Government, which is being provided with valuable assistance by the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will provide a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that have taken place with them.
This issue has a deep humanitarian dimension, and we will maintain the position that European politicians should adopt in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU Summit and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, better border control and reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance received from the EU in order to be able to deal with this pressing problem.
Mr. Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Drujkovka Donetsk oblast, the criminal investigation officers of the General Police Department of the region, together with military counter-intelligence, established and detained a suspect, who had been killed by a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the town of Kriva Rog (Dnipropetrovsky region), who had been using alcohol together the previous night, and the conflict that had arisen in the village of Verkhnetobutler of the Yasinovsky district of Donetchina, who had fired a rifle at his opponent.
A 22-year-old was reported injured from a hospital where he was hospitalized with a cross-section gunshot wound to his legs.
As Artem Vasitsky, the Deputy Chief of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Milic Chief of the Region, told the law enforcement officers, during the course of the operational activities, had established the involvement of the person in another serious criminal offence, the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operatives found that on the same day, a conflict had taken place between the suspect and another local resident, resulting in a fatal gunshot wound to the man's head.
The Investigation Division of the Drujkovskaya GO has opened criminal proceedings under the articles "Intentional murder" and "Intensive infliction of serious bodily harm" of the Criminal Code.
The detainee is at risk of up to 15 years & apos; imprisonment.
Figurant was detained and placed in a temporary detention facility and reported to the police press service in Donetsk province.
Two residents of Novosibersk, who painted several Soviet monuments in the colour of the Ukrainian flag, including two monuments of Vladimir Lenin, were sentenced by the Russian court to imprisonment.
Two other residents of the city were sentenced to restriction of liberty.
The residents of Novosibirsk who received prison sentences were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years & apos; imprisonment.
Two other convicted persons received a 14-month and 18-month limit.
The Lenin Court of Novosibirsk found four of the cities guilty of vandalism against the Leninu monuments, which were located on the territory of the KPRF site and on the Tricotar Street, as well as the Monument of Fame memorial complex.
In the latter case, the Katyusha missile plant and the T-34 tank were painted.
On the night of 12 December, in Russian Novosibirsk, the unknown painted a military equipment on Monument of Glory in the colour of the Ukrainian flag.
The civilian wife of a popular Russian actor, Yevgeny Ziganov Irina Leonov, gave birth to a seventh child.
The girl appeared in one of Moscow's clinics.
The new one and her mom feel good.
Let's just say the Gypsies and Leonov just broke up.
Eugenia refuses to comment.
Irina is accusing his husband of everything and his ambition.
Eugenia Ziganov is 36 years old.
He is an actor at the Moscow Theatre of the Master Petra Fomenko.
It is known for the films "The Way," "Space as a Prognosis," "The Brest Fortress," "The Ottepel" and "Farza."
On September 8, Yevgeny Zyganov was recognized "Actor of the Year" and "Man of the Year" as a version of the Russian version of the popular GQ magazine.
The man who opened fire at Delta State University left an apology note.
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he "regrets" about the first murder and would like "all of it back" was informed by the authorized authorities on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, report that a professor of geography and social sciences at the University of Delta called 911 at around 10: 00 in the morning.
Monday and he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police had to send people to his house.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there's a "dog" in the house that "will not hurt anyone," but is probably upset.
The police asked the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the fire.
When the police came to the crime scene, they found Amy Prentiss's body, 41, and a hand-written note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm sorry to bring it back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb travelled 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on the evening of Monday, when he was surrounded by the police, he killed himself.
The University Rector, William Laforge, reported that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind."
Despite information received on Monday that Lamb had an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, the official services reported on Tuesday "no information or evidence of a" love triangle. "
On Prentiss was referred to as a "good man" by Sean O'Steen, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they were friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19, and that she was "insane."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Knowles, a newspaper called San Gerald, a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles told me that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she was dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his family on Monday at some point to say "he's not going to prison."
In the evening of the same day, when the police hit him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself.
According to a summary on the university website, Lamb received a doctorate in teaching at the University of Delta in the spring of 2015.
Stars who have lost their fortune
The actor (left), in a picture with his son Redmond (right), has been through several difficult years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his long-standing life companion Farra Fosett, who died of cancer.
The actor was also reported to have suffered from drug dependence and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of this has, of course, played a role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United left for a few months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champion League game, where Manchester United lost PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defence counsel is concerned about this, which will not be able to enter the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw can play again in this season.
The injury occurred during the reckless subset of Hector Moreno at the 15th minute when Shaw, 20, entered the PSV.
He was assisted on the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then they'll operate.
It's terrible that a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcome a lot of difficulties, and started playing fantastic, and that's where it happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months, and the guy can't play in a group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and no penalty.
The arbitrator, Nikola Rizzoli, did not punish a Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
You can judge when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad podcast on two feet.
In his tweet, Shaw says, "Thank you all for your messages, not to describe how devastated I am, my way to recovery is beginning, I'll be back even more than I was."
Also on the subject: Manchester United is in a state of disaster with Luke Shaw in a game with PSV.
The British advocate will have an additional incentive to recover to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Coke, the PSV coach, said, "This is a very serious injury."
When any player gets out with a trauma like this, everyone's very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to traumatize the enemy.
Moreno had a broken leg when he was playing for Mexico against the Holland team led by Van Gal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him now, because he had no intention of hurting an enemy, and when you hear it's a very serious injury, it's not good," Koku said.
I didn't have the opportunity to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was a ball that flew in a different direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched it, but I didn't see a podcast under Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to carry.
I'm very hard, and I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado from PSV was also taken to hospital after a clash with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about the Lorax?
Every parent learns one thing very quickly: if your child likes some book, it'll be a little while before you get to know it almost by heart.
I guess unless you're David Cameron.
In response to a question from a representative of a company that was organizing children's rest on vacation, about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "Lorax," a tale of environmental inclinations written by Dr. Suz in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, written Cameron in a comment published on Supercamps's website, and continues, "This fun, touching, extraordinary story with a strong message I love to read to my children because it always shows some image or message that we miss."
And it would be all right, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to rewrite the contents of the book, but actually tells a story of a single-name film made in 2012 with new characters and details added to diversify a rather short original story.
"In the high-wall-surrounded city of Wasseznashville, where there was no green, and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted is hoping to win Audrey's heart, the girl of his dreams, by her desire to see a real tree," we read in the text a description of the love story that Dr. Sousa (the real name Theodor Suz Geisel) died in 1991.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text is read almost as a summary of the story of "Lorax," on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high walls of the city of Wessezneville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted is hoping to win Audrey's heart, the girl of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, as a generally active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy will learn about the destruction of the environment by a greedy tree-breaker and a "all-nighter" of Nagokins, despite the protests of Lorax (whose name is given in the name of the book), a funny being with a mustache that "speaks on behalf of trees."
It is likely that such a simple PR task was assigned to an artist who never read a book about the children of Lorax 20 times in a row.
The representative of Downing Street said that the text had allegedly been received from the Cameron office in the electoral district.
Supercamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments were received.
For Adam Lit, there was clearly a risk of not getting into England's team, but that's still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you look at the team that England has chosen for this tour, it does not seem to me that I would be able to repeat the defeat in the 3-0 test series last time.
I would also not rule out a victory in my field.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but there are some players who take the ball with a virtuo, and collective thinking is strong; they will not bring scars from 2012, but only a young man.
With the ball, Moen Ali is turned into a bowler serving the ball, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attack option.
Also on the subject, Adam Lit left England on a test cricket and was replaced by Alex Hayles.
The decision to exclude Adam Lit to me, his main coach at Yorkshire, is, of course, difficult to analyse.
His seven test games had two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the obvious but violent reality is that cricket players are judged by the judges as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I said it before) the players are the best to choose themselves.
A couple of half a hundred, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in the power of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The main coach of England's team, Trevor Bayliss, was good at his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's first a team player, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the test-cricket batshift leaves itself an impression is a complex question.
Lit played seven games, just like Sam Robinson before him, and Nick Compton at nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on someone else's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Prime League when Lit was in the best form, but this lost opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and he's a Batman I appreciate high.
He's an unpredictable cricket, which we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season, when he made 236 in a game against us at Trent Bridge, which was something.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The thought of putting Moen next to Cook as the opening-up batshift, which would allow an additional back-up, while keeping four speed bowls, is being considered, and I'm not against it at all.
I don't see why a hit player can't take the ball out there, and this left-hand guy has already shown that he's a damn good cricket.
Moen may not be exactly what it takes for his county of Woostershire, but he became the third number for them, and there's no big difference.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test games with the third batshift before entering as an opening in 2001.
He won three hundred at once, and he didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a back-up, and in my short relationship with him, he seems to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his exemplary statistics - on average 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball - and think it's a risky bet, but among the pro-voters' spines, they choose to be young.
He'll learn a lot about this tour.
In addition to the team, England plans to make a few practical additions to the coach's staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayahuordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the test games, could be a workshop.
He's one of the best guys for a game that will bring in the richest experience that can be gained under all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and a ruthless pace in the setup.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in an international cricket, whether it be a game or a coach, and, like Mahela, has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what was said earlier, can give the team new strength.
Colly's colleague, Darem Ben Stokes, is left for one-year-old, Ruth has been given a similar break in Australia, and I, for example, have no problems.
Although not all will agree, coaches and players do not set a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
A camp for the British withdrawal from the European Union can win if the economy is depressed by 2017.
David Cameron's failed policy to resume negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU is increasingly difficult every day, even without looking back at the selection of the genius Jeremi- "Is it a yes or no?" - Corbina by the leader of the laborists or the indignation of the TUC over Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that, in the current situation of the EU, which is experiencing a variety of crises - not all of them of its own manufacture - some of the participating countries are fed up by the British self-centered agenda of the sowing of concessions and the undermining of agreements, changes that they do not want.
When he met at Brighton on an annual basis, the TUC decided that he did not want them in any case if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it the "Dave and George's selfie program."
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance ride through summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the background of a famous local monument, in or without a local celebrity company, then come home and say they attract allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be interested in maintaining external contacts with Britain under the shadow of the European Union - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - suggests that off-the-line ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they don't care whether we stay or not.
Angela Merkel, a very careful German Chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation for her is worse, as she has deteriorated for those who have been seated in her place, Thatcher (11), Mitterran (14) and Kol (16).
The head of France, François Holland, is before re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing his power, too.
Poland can soon receive a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing government.
It's hard to see them coming out of their skin to help the "selfi brits" whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - which they don't want, either, because most people have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even plan to issue deliberately useless SNP-style speeches during the British referendum campaign in 2017 to encourage Britain's withdrawal from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The revision was an idea-fix," and "Britain received nothing valuable from the resumed negotiations."
Europeans know, for their own good, what a predator would be Flit Street, and how skeptical of the EU is the media magnates, as opposed to the time of the 1975 Tony Bn referendum, which supported our entry into 1973 by a 2: 1 relationship.
They may be confused to remember Boris Johnson, a carved Euro-opportunist, who was famous for his "direct EU bananas" of a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a pawn company of tax-afraid crooks, foreign phone hackers and pseudo-non-residents, who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was quite the same about them, but he was aware that when you were in a cage with a brown gorilla, you had to give her the bananas to distract her and keep her from eating you for lunch and again with the tea.
In the case of Milliband, there was a greater commitment to Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's idea of a referendum, because Blair had adopted principles in favour of the abrogated EU Constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who had granted him a win-win ticket.
The press didn't forgive him any of this.
But the good-looking Jeremy Corbin, who's been pounding me on my back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn't have time to spend it on me anymore - seems to be risking repeating the strategy of Neil Kinnok's' 80s boycott '- an error both then and now.
It might take a while, but he has to develop a consistent strategy for working with the press - not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose couch he was sitting on on on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I call evolution sensitive.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditional Zinist trend of Ukip and a wider range of "supporters of small England" among the tori might say "yes."
It's the same thing that Hilary-" Bennes, but not Bennit "- Ben said on radio and TV this week, and his internal boyscout refused to admit that Corbin's appointment of the unlucky John McDonnell" shadow "as finance minister was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father fought hard on TV for being inloyal to his colleagues in the Labour Cabinet without going too far and losing his post in the Cabinet.
Hillary's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay "under all circumstances" - the Benna phrase - is not what McDonnell said, and not what J. K. said to the pagers and members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, by all accounts.
Whatever the Democrat and his boyfriend, Corbin, remember, he touched even me, the discipline of messages remains important in the age of 24-hour television seven days a week, especially in the water gate of social networks, a paranoia and betrayal.
It's wise not to let Cameron get away from Europe as easily as possible, allowing him to accept as appropriate the support of the laborists during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But the main misconception of McDonnell and Corbin over EU membership - within the Bennite economy of besieged fortress - is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for whom narcissism, caused by little difference, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about Nato - Tom Watson is unswerving that J.K. will not be campaigning for his exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring it to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on Britain's concessions when it can be pointless?
The US is already very disappointed by the weak military action of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tori government is cutting the costs, as I was reminded on Monday during lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of e-cigarettes from Public Health England
The Government-funded agency & apos; s statements that 95 per cent of e-cigarettes were less harmful than smoking were made at the meeting by 12 people, some of whom were related to the tobacco industry, as reported by researchers.
Experts published in British Medical Journal (BMJ) jointly with Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published an important report, "turning point" last month, calling it "a comprehensive review of evidence."
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed out the link between some experts and the tobacco industry.
In an editorial article in Lancet's medical journal last month, they criticized "an extremely shady argument," on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers asked whether these statements had "firm or flimsy grounds."
Martin McKee, a teacher of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capwell, a teacher of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of health - the rules must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
According to them, the public expects that the PHE statements that "the current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco" are based on detailed evidence and modelling.
In fact, this is taken from the only meeting of 12 people who have come together to develop a model for multi-criteria decision-making analysis in order to summarize their views on the damage associated with various nicoticocontaining products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capwell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwiss Health, whose Director General was informed that he had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also confirmed the BAT health certificates in the Sustainable Development Report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, without mentioning the funding that he had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the selection of the members of the Board, but there were several known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which also stated that industry was being funded in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants have experience in tobacco management.
The tobacco manager at PHE also visited the meeting.
The scientific article published by the group "concretely agrees" that there is a lack of "strong evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria" has been written by McKee and Keipwell.
However, none of these links and restrictions were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's statements that "there is no evidence at this time that electronic cigarettes are a road that leads to children or non-smoking" were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, the head of health and well-being in PHE, said that BMJ's statements had already been answered.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than tobacco smoking."
One of the two smokers in his life died of his passion.
All the evidence suggests that the health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what these evidence is and is not proving, especially where the public had doubts about the relative risk of tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases, while the smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
It is clear that, while electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only cause part of the harm caused by smoking, we perform our tasks before the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 thinks that BBC should stop EastEnders.
The former head of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, is of the view that the BBC should stop the production of such programs as Eastern Enders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would give a lot for successful shows as a soap opera on Albert's Square.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should be used only to establish programmes that are not issued by other British television and radio companies.
He criticized the BBC for making public broadcasts, which are probably only looking at a small part of the audience, at the peak time of high-rating competition, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had, for six years, failed to work with the BBC while working on Channel 4.
"I can't move away from the idea that the BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting programmes that could be shown to competing companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told the members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of the search for the future of the BBC.
If you keep the licence fee, which I don't think is a good solution in the medium and long term, companies should keep on-line only those programmes that are not produced and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice show is on the premiere, because the creators want the best possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else should show it is ridiculous and clearly absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should be used to finance transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is well known that they are their own production.
Other channels would certainly give a lot for it.
I don't understand how it could be public.
I don't think it would have been any way to lower the BBC.
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings "because of the staff's ambitions and because of their belief that it was the best way to get support for a long period."
His comments on the most popular show on the BBC are in line with those of the executive director, Sky Tony Ball, who, in his 2003 McTaggart Memorial Lecture in Edinburgh, offered the BBC to sell East Enders.
Johnson noted that the more niche BBC of a public nature "continues to go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate the audience, but that the company's function is performed, and this can be argued in a bizarre preach that justifies a 4 billion pounds of licence revenue:" yes, of course, we do all these incomprehensible programmes that no one's watching. "
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
With regard to the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I call on you to find a more regressive system as to who gets the most from it.
Of course, you all think we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people who have 150 pounds of money, I'm interested, they think that because they don't look and listen to the BBC.
The former executive director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also addressed the committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should review Rita's mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He noted that only a small part of BBC production was now formally classified as educational - according to him, it was 1% of television content and 0.1% of radio - and that the company should take over the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the theme "inform, educate and entertain."
On partnership issues, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as "Promenade concerts" (only a few of them he said were on TV), as well as enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for online viewing.
"Sonogenetics" allows you to control the brain cells with sound waves.
The video shows how nematodes change the direction of motion when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have taken out worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound wave pulses.
The tiny nematodes change the direction of movement at a time when they are exposed to sound impulses too high to be heard by the human ear.
Pulses have an impact by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Also on the subject: Researchers manage brain activity by means of light
Scientists said that the worms were showing the possibilities of a new methodology called "sonogenetics," the essence of which was to use ultrasound to induce certain cells of the brain, heart and muscles, with the source of ultrasound being located outside the body.
Schrikant Chalasani, a researcher at the Solka Institute, La Hoya, California, told Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent into the human brain and used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Nematode worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they were beginning to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that bubbles increase ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The increased ultrasound waves have an impact on the structures called the "ion channels TRP-4," found in the membrane of some of the cells of the worms.
Ultrasonic waves force these ion channels to open and attract cells that are associated with them, as reported in Nature Communications.
To create the nematode that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani has made genetic changes to the worms, so their propulsion neurons have used the ionic channels TRP-4.
During the application of ultrasound to modified organisms, sound waves were increased by microscopic bubbles and were introduced into worms, activating modified engine neurons.
This method is similar to that used in "optogenetics," a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and turn off neurons with light impulses.
Chalasani claims that there may be some advantages to Sonogenetics over this methodology.
In contrast to the light that is delivered to the right section of the brain through the fibre optic, low-frequency ultrasound waves are free to pass through the tissue of the body, so they do not need to be delivered inside the skull box.
"We believe that to treat some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of genetic therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to make human neurons sensitive to ultrasound signals for a while," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
The prohibited dust equipment is right on your doorstep!
Advertising is making fun of the British arms trade.
Look at the Amnesty International video with a protest against the arms exhibit.
The amazing killer drones!
Chalk-cutting iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electrical light and noise batons that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
There is no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international arms exhibition is a yoke parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British Government's intention to "push" weapons to repressive regimes, using the anti-defence technology and security system exhibition at the Exel centre in Dockland.
Also on the subject: DSEI Arms Exhibition: authoritarian regimes are going to London
But a special campaign also leads to the sudden emergence of many beds at bus stops and in the trains of the subway, which require a look at them again.
"An important announcement on the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them in the London subway with a DLR line that turns into a tank silhouette.
In September this year, a crowd of arms dealers will come into the DLR line.
300 beds are painted by artists who put their work at the "Museum of Harmful Design" in the Banksy Park "Dismanland."
A team called the Special Patrol Group helped to spread them across London, using a "set of decapitators," a 6-pound set of wrench keys, which is said to "provide access to about one third of the advertising space at the bus stops on the planet."
London's transport is not happy with such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorised beds.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, the curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and a teacher at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and seeking to bring political art to an audience outside the gallery.
Many artists are beginning to work with protesters, knowing that they have to go into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against an arms exhibition, welcoming passengers on the subway.
The video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the VCCP agency, which works pro bono, with the use of a graphic designer and an artist who also works free of charge.
The executive director of VCCP, Matt Lover, was struck by an advertising silence around an arms exhibition, with an Excel card, and thought, "Let's run them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought of creating a more realistic and cunning corporate advertising, but "filling its houses with bright flowers and animation was a more exciting occupation."
"They have unbelievably helped us draw attention to the sale of illegal dust equipment at the exhibition," said Tom Davis of Amnesty.
Now we need the British Government to take action and guarantee that this dust equipment will not be illegally sold right at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art on the arms exhibition is from the inside of ExeL, where participants trade in fantastic euphemic products.
In a press release, Saab released an order on "AT4CS RS for shoulder-to-shoulder fire" from the United States Army.
It includes "an unparalleled cumulative weapon that has an inescapable and inbound effect."
Whatever he does, it won't be nice.
Eight gold rules for living in student dormitories
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student dorm as a normal 19-year-old man who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the long-standing smile of those I've been irritating - and the many, long complaints against others.
Most of what I've learned can be divided into eight simple rules.
The move to a dorm can range from a little nervous to a completely frightening.
He encourages you to talk: to tell people where you were from, whether you took an academic leave, and where you spent it, whether you're supporting Corbin, and why you "honestly, I don't love, or hate" Marmaite, "because, seriously, guys, it's just a hahahaha yshake, I'm gonna be there."
Take a break.
And help others take a break, too, ask questions and show interest.
It keeps you talking and it helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire, and they would give out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People & apos; s rooms are often turned into food facilities, semi-night cinemas and common party places, but they are also a place where people dress and fix their underwear.
Also on the subject, don't even think about going to university when you're in a relationship.
Introverts at universities are not treated fairly.
Your room has to be a safe house, but many dormitories form a culture of shaking from one room to another, which is conducive to friendship, communication and long-term friendship.
It could be hell for someone who's trying to restore power.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to keep being friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I can restore the energy I've spent on talking to you."
Try to feel when a coworker is tired of communication, and not knock on him, but send a SMS.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
One guy in my dorm followed that principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Start your friends with the bake.
Since you start your university life at the peak of the popularity of the Bake-Off show, you knock on the door to people to introduce yourself and put a bowl of chocolate biscuits, not as strange as the 1950s from their "Welcome, we're neighbors, I made you something, and now smile, and I'm gonna ask you personal questions."
It's a good way to make friends to offer home-made.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end, your face will probably be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are.
The bad-blooded cats of flour, sugar and fat would rather make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Food theft is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, the attribution of someone's chicken is a theft, but is it a theft to take a little milk for tea?
Get the owner of the milk.
He's probably gonna tell you not to be shy, even if it's furious inside.
If someone's stealing your stuff, it's annoying, and I'm sorry to you, but try to take care of this adult than my neighbor, who put in his milk a water to wash the dishes to get revenge on those who took him without asking.
She's in prison now.
You don't have to make noise that will stop people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent man, but also because you're the same people who said the words about glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to lower the sound of the drum and the bass guitar because she had 3: 00 in the morning and had an examination in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5: 00 in the morning, she was kind enough to let him sleep for two hours, and then took out her music and locked the door behind him, going to a three-hour test.
Was it not romantic if your future husband had settled in the same dorm as you?
On the contrary, would it not be extremely, until the elbows were bitten, more clumsy if you took a neighbor for your future wife, had a crush on him, broken up his relationship and had to see him every day, and perhaps watch him pull all your common friends on his side?
Of course, you can't tell your heart, but if a hot neighbor is definitely not your future husband, try to cool your own dust a little.
At that exciting moment, when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between the prank and the trauma is thinner than it looks.
A good prank is fun, but it turns into its opposite in a few seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something -- but never pack someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone else's door and put the keys in a glass of water that you'll put in the freezer, but don't put other people's things with Blu-Tack on the ceiling more than two times.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on an iPhone after the Apple update is issued
The new operating system can be requested to select the General and then the Software Update by entering the Settings application.
If it's ready, the phone will let you download it and set it up.
Some had problems after installation, when an error was reported, saying that "The application could not be updated."
To avoid this, users are encouraged to either wait until the recovery is over or try to update through iTunes.
The clues on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process.
The process may include the removal of applications to increase the free place - but Apple minimized the probability of the action by reducing the size of the update, and also facilitated implementation by means of a special tool that proposes to remove the applications and re-establish them after the process has been completed.
It is necessary to make sure that your phone is loaded or close to the charger in order to prevent the battery from being discharged when it is updated.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as the release of the phone in the process can lead to a failure in the update.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity with a telephone call.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian colleague, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support provided by Moscow to President Assad only contributed to the exacerbation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about it with a Russian colleague, and writes PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activities in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's continued support for President Assad poses a risk of deepening and prolonging the conflict, as well as a negative impact on our common goal - the fight against extremism - if we also do not continue to focus on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict by direct transfer of power," the representatives of the United States Department of State said.
They also noted that Kerry had once again stressed the US commitment to fight the Islamic State through a coalition from more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad would never be able to be a member.
In addition, the US will "welcome Russia's constructive role in trying to resist the Islamic State."
Last Friday, the White House stated that they did not know exactly what the Russian forces were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the matter with Moscow.
However, White House press secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone call between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet come: "When the President decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will raise the phone and try to make that call."
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime to be a "loss rate."
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him it was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he did not listen to my warnings - and as a result the situation deteriorated," said the President of the United States.
The yachts being imported will be exempt from the payment of customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating means for rest and sport from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import have been prepared by the Ministry on instructions from the Government of the Russian Federation.
The Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Lashkin, reported this to the "News."
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, on the basis of his visit to Crimea, appointed a number of agencies - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - to prepare proposals for the creation of an enabling environment for the yachting in the coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
The owners prefer to keep their ships abroad, with about 200 million per year being held by European States for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission on the amendment of the list of goods temporarily imported with a total conditional exemption from the payment of customs duties, taxes, which provides for full conditional exemption from the payment of customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other recreational and sporting means of navigation.
In the view of the Ministry, this would certainly contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for the development of a yachting in the coastal areas of the country, as noted by Lashkin.
This issue was submitted to the subcommission on customs and tariff, non-tariff, foreign trade protection of the Government Commission for Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also endorsed by the agencies as a result of the discussion.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure for full conditional release on import was in fact a good one.
Therefore, after the adoption of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic and Social Affairs will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member States of the EEA, explained Lashkin.
The list of imported goods that are fully exempt from the payment of customs duties, taxes includes goods necessary for the promotion of foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for use in science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc., such as service equipment (personal computers, writing machines), test instruments, drilling equipment, test suits and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skiing, racing vehicles, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, music tools and religious objects.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs's Press Service, "Vestivestiam," said that it had prepared binding regulations on the ports of Kerci, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupatia, which provided for a simplified procedure for the entry and release of small, sports sailing and pleasure vessels to the sea port.
The Mintrance has been instructed to the Crimea seaports to ensure that the simplified procedures for the entry of small, sports and recreational vessels into the seaport and for the withdrawal of the listed vessels from the seaport are applied.
The Ministry of the Interior has also prepared draft regulations of the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the boundaries of the sea ports of Crimea.
In the case of Yalta and Feodosia, orders have already been issued, and the rest are in the process of being agreed upon, as noted by the press service of the department.
In the view of the Ministry of the Interior, State supervision, classification and inspection, State registration for small craft used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia, it is because of a weak infrastructure that is very difficult with the yachting.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, it's a whole, ever-growing industry with a large number of people involved.
In Russia, in fact, everything is in place.
Our coast is not interesting, the only one where you can use a yacht all year round is the Black Sea in the Sochi area, Gelenjica, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the great difficulty is that there are very strict border rules in this area: a lot of permits must be issued in order to take a walk on the boat.
Besides, there's not even a place to fuel a yacht inside Russia.
She can go with her fuel for two days, and then she gets a problem where to get it, says the director of sales for Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
With regard to yacht storage, there are now special yacht hangars up to 30 in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The yachts are also being deposited in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that the yacht buyers were rich people, but that the demand for yacht had declined since the crisis began.
The World Bank has provided $500 million in credit to Ukraine.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"New funding will support a number of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," referred to in the report.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldavia and Ukraine, Tsimayo Fan, said that the reforms of the banking sector would help to revive loans in the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and that the World Bank was witnessing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate the reforms.
The Polish Government had previously approved a credit of 100 million to Ukraine, and was transferring RIA News.
In prisons, they are asked to set up separate units for transgenders.
At the Public Council of the Federal Penal Enforcement Service (FISN) for the protection of the rights of convicted persons in October 2015, among other issues, the possibility of establishing separate units for transgenders and transvestites in the colonies will be discussed.
The Council member, Vladislav Grib, told the news about this.
In his view, depending on the total number of non-gender convicted persons in Russia, it was possible to provide for separate cells, blocks or even (if there was a large number of such criminals) in national prisons in the future to establish a special colony for transgender persons.
However, Vladislav Grib stresses that it is only possible to determine the execution of the sentence of citizens in such isolated places after the convicted persons have received appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the offender is indeed a person who identifies himself as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice was successful abroad: the SIZO (where the accused were pending a court decision) provided for separate cells for transgenders and special units in correctional institutions.
Today is the only way to work with such criminals.
They clearly need to be isolated, as the presence of transvestites and transgenders in normal cells is dangerous to them, and it is a suffering for their families and the sea of problems for the staff of the FCN.
The destruction of the trance by the co-inmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how large the city is, how many criminals with an uncertain gender need to be expected to be distributed.
There's no need for some of them, just cameras, prison blocks.
Yeah, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgenders.
As the Grib explained, 50 or 100 persons could be held in the block, and if a specialized unit was established in Russia alone, prisoners of transgender persons could be admitted to prison from any region.
Citizens are held in the remand centre at the crime scene, so the transvestites or transgenders from other actors are not real during the investigation and trial, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes - is considered by the Grib.
The day before, it was not possible for law enforcement officials to decide to which detention centre, male or female, to identify a 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Kojukova (known as Alina Davis) for possession of drugs, which resulted in a man who had no female appearance being arrested.
He was released home on a non-departure subscription.
This news has been widely discussed in social media and media, as there is no mechanism for keeping transgenders in the SIZO and in the colonies in Russia.
The Russian human rights defender, an LGBT movement activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender), Nikolai Alexev, supported the creation of special places to serve sentences by transgenders, noting that it was also possible to identify people in a colony, male or female, on the basis of their own will, abroad.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is right.
Yeah, that's a very small percentage, but the problem is, as is the issue of ensuring the safety of homosexuals in prisons, Alexev says.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be made for this and for homosexuals, especially since they were more in prison than transgenders.
At the same time, Alexev is in doubt that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to turn themselves into transecsuals in order to go to a different colony.
Of course, you can introduce a medical examination before you put people in a transgender colony, but it's not always clear.
In the United States, for example, one of Chelsea Manning's prisoners looked like a man, and already in prison said he wanted to change the sex, said Alexev.
A man can feel like anyone.
But as long as there are no separate places for transgenders to serve their sentences, I doubt that prison staff will be seriously thinking about the safety of such people and entering into their insensitivity or sexual identification.
At the same time, the international reproductive health expert in the territory of the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transgender offenders in the colony could significantly delay the beginning of the sentence for convicted persons.
A commission is being established - a matter of sexology, and psychiatrists are conducting long-term observations, and it is not one test on the basis of which a highly sensitive opinion is made.
Today's psychiatric capacity makes it possible.
Therefore, and before a change in sex, potential patients always undergo such tests - they clearly show whether a change of sex with surgical intervention is a necessary measure - according to Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how this system can be introduced in relation to convicted persons, as it takes an average of one month.
The doctor, although there was general support for the establishment of separate units for transgender people, also doubts that, under the current economic conditions, it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new facilities, medical expertise, and transgenders in Russia.
There are no official statistics, but considering that about 5% of homosexuals are in Russia, it can be said that transgenders are even smaller, and that those who have such a deviation and commit crimes are very few, said by Lordkipanidze.
At present, at the request of the colony administration, homosexuals, transgender men and women can obtain separate conditions of detention.
Michael Antipov won the World's Junior Championship on chess.
In Hunte-Mansiysk, the world chess championship was completed among young people up to the age of 20.
The end of firstness was more than intriguing.
The winner only decided on the last round, and was a Russian man, Mikhail Antipov, who was able to catch the Poles of Jan-Kshishtof Dudu, who seemed to have taken his title in confidence.
The girls had a Ukrainian chess player, Natalia Bux.
The World Chess Championship, held in Hunte Mansiysk since early September, seemed to have lost almost all the intrigue by the middle of the tournament, as the Polish representative, Jan-Kshishtof Duda, who had issued a series of four victories (the Swiss 13-tour competition), had taken a firm lead.
In view of the fact that Duda was a first-hand rating, and is generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the likelihood that he would lose the gap was very low.
And even when Duda failed and allowed Russian Mikhail Anstov to reduce the backlog to only 0.5, he remained a clear favorite in the struggle for title.
Because Anstov had to win the 13th round in order to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help if you won Dude's party.
Plus, this obligation of victory, of course, could have affected the game of the Russian chess player and led to non-binding mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov managed to avoid them.
He made sure of Francesco Rambaldi, and then he had to wait for his party to be completed by Duda, who met with Benjamin Bok.
Luckily for Anstov, the Polish chess player was in a fight with the Dutch knot.
Thus, the Antipov and Duda had an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Anstov had the best additional indicators.
It is for him, therefore, that the leadership of the Hunta-Mansiya Autonomous Region, whose Governor Natalia Komarova has traditionally given high priority to the development of chess in the region, has given the main prize.
But there was no ending in the girls' competition.
The winner of the tournament, Natalia Bukse (Ukraine), was enough not to lose in the last round to win the title, which she had done with success.
So the Russian woman's victory, Alina Bevol, prevented her from catching up with Bux.
The Russian athlete remained the second to be behind the 0.5-ball championship.
The regional structure is changing.
The company connects the Privolz and Ural regions into one expanded Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East to the East region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As noted by the Director-General of Vompelkoma, Michael Slobodone, changes are being made to "remain a strong player in the market," develop the company "in new, not always favourable external conditions."
In an interview with the Russian 24 channel, Mr. Slobol stated that they intended to reduce "tens of per cent" of personnel in Russia.
The RoseSurvey checked 78 Moscow-based Burger King and issued 367 orders.
As a result, a restaurant on the Volokolam highway was fined 50,000 roubles, and the establishment on the Grand Tuli Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after all violations had been resolved.
43 of the diners violated the requirements for the establishment of the premises.
Among other violations, poor sanitation and sanitation, non-compliance with ventilation requirements, some have found intestinal-wand bacteria.
The Burger King brand is owned by Burger Rus, the owner of the Chocolate-Lodger network, Alexander Kollov, and 293 diners are working in Russia.
Igor Artemev, the head of the FAS, stated that the agency was not indexing 10 per cent of the freight and State subsidies, as requested by the RZD.
First they wanted 17% indexing, now they want 10%, and also a multi-billion-dollar budget subsidy, he says.
We say it's wrong, it's too much, it's too much, you can reduce your costs, you can learn to save, you can give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, you can stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FÁS had its "much more stringent" proposals, which were being discussed in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net-calculation option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of performing on a $300 million-worth of stock, reported to the gold company.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the value of the Sumeru stock and market quotations), which can be taken from the free flow of money.
Sumeru has time until October 3 to implement the option or to demand further payment.
The details of the Polymetal negotiations are not open.
The Opzion was concluded as part of the purchase of the Polymetal project "Kizil" in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of the Ministry & apos; s Housing Policy Department, reported that the Ministry, together with the ECB, was developing a settlement for the developers.
"We understand that this is not going anywhere, so we are developing an appropriate mechanism," said the official.
The writing of "Citizen Kane" is being put on the market.
Representatives of the Profiles in History auction house reported plans to bid a black version of the "Citizen Kane" scenario, which is considered one of the best works of the director, writer and actor Orson Wells.
The auction will begin in the city of Kalabas on September 29, and will present three preliminary versions of the scenario, each of which is estimated at $20-30,000, and will be passed on to AP.
The first of them, written in 1940 by Germany Mankevich, is the most early scenario in private collections? and is called "American" - a working name that was at the film's.
The second draft is a more complete version of the scenario, and the third is the final plan of the film.
Mentoring: targeted food aid will not be an analogue of cards in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Yetukhov, reported that the targeted food aid programme would not be an analogue of the food distribution card system in the USSR.
It is a matter of modern targeted food aid to the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the word "food card."
In particular, it is not necessary to confuse the proposed product maps with the recent total deficit, a card distribution system in which the number of products produced is normalized.
We have, for the time being, proposed a concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the law, "which brings to the attention of the TAS the words of Mr. Yevtukhov.
Previously, I wrote that a programme to introduce food cards for the poor had been introduced into the government.
For more information on the Minpromerg initiative, read in "I" Igor Shuwalov has ordered the preparation of food cards. "
The President of the Rosgoscience wants to divorce his wife.
A source familiar with the situation informed RAPI that the President of the Rosgosmod insurance company, Danil Hacaturov, had applied to the Moscow Court for the dissolution of the marriage with the designer Ulana Sergienko.
The Court of Justice of the Peace No. 100 will be opened on 16 September.
Danil Hacaturov is asking for his marriage to be dissolved and his joint property to be shared.
The court confirmed that there was a divorce claim in the proceedings, noting that no property-sharing action had been taken and would be brought before a district court.
President Alexander Bobresov of RZD is leaving his post.
The Vice-President of the Russian Railways (RZD) for corporate security, Alexander Bobresov, is leaving the company and is reporting to Interfax, referring to the source.
The Vice-Prime President of Russia, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of RZD, Arkady Dzadković, stated that the issue of the withdrawal from RZD of Alexander Bobresov had been initiated by a new head of the company, Oleg Beloserov.
According to the Vice-Premier, the staff changes in the management of the RZD are not related to the change in the head of the company.
Previously, "I" reported that, instead of Vladimir Yakunin of the UAO, RZD had been led by the first Deputy Minister of Transport, Mr. Oleg Beloserov, who was responsible for the financial unit.
The new head of the company first announced reforms in the monopoly: a new system of freight tariffs will be established in a year and a half.

This year, a study by the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1,000 Russian Managers" is being published at the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian managers of the highest echelon, the study takes stock of the work of Russian managers during the year, identifying the leaders in the industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates is made up of last year's ratings.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for this year & apos; s rating and to nominate their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the original list is invited to nominate up to 10 new managers from other companies that would be useful to be added to the common pool of candidates.
The following company managers may be nominated: the Finance Director, the Commercial Director, the Marketing Director, the Staff Director, the IT Director, the Director of Public and Corporate Relations, the Director of Relations with Authorities, and the Director of Corporate Governance.
Each expert-proposed manager is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to present his or her management team and up to 10 new managers from other companies.
The industry-based nomination of candidates is based on an industry classification of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and forestry, engineering, media, metallurgy, multi-disciplinary holding, professional services, communications and telecommunications, service and consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant shall be provided with a logic and password to enter the website www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information on the other participants and may present their estimates on the criteria proposed for each functional direction.
The rating methodology is based on the "Best Choice" principle: top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle provides the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating shall be approved at meetings of the expert commissions.
All interested candidates for this year & apos; s rating and multiple candidates for past years are invited to the face-to-face meetings of the expert commissions.
The commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission for the approval of the top management list and eight commissions for the approval of the functional direction managers.
At meetings of the expert commissions, it is proposed that the lists submitted be approved in alphabetical order (seats are kept strictly according to the Internet assessment and are closed prior to the publication of the rating) or that they be updated in accordance with the attached roster of stand-by candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of Russian and the rules of "I."
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The trading rate for the investment is 10-13%.
Experts estimated that the small and medium-sized business credit market had run 40 per cent in January-April of this year.
What are your estimates of the situation today?
After the panic of the end of 2014 and early 2015, the loan levels of the SDS have declined significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
The 25-30% annual credit was not beneficial to anyone.
If the bank had previously been able to put all its possible problems in a higher rate in the future, from delays to non-returns, it is not possible to do so now: the rates are well-established.
For business, the current level of the IBM credit rates is not comfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is not acceptable in terms of their payback.
The rate level of 10-13 per cent would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and create attractive returns.
How much do you estimate the demand of entrepreneurs for credit is met?
The situation has improved slightly since the fall in the interest rate of the ECB.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, clients have become much less likely to apply for credit.
In the first place, business does not understand its development prospects and future income.
Today, business has one option: to learn to work on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
There is a need to monitor current results more closely, and to monitor cash flows.
At the same time, where financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
This, in the end, allows companies to make products more competitive and to keep business even in a volatile economic situation.
What are the main trends in the IBM credit market that will be strengthened and will have an impact on its development before the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The medium-rate reduction forecast will depend to a large extent on the Central Bank's policy, and the regulator is now showing consistency in reducing the key rate.
However, there is no need to wait for a radical fall in the credit price for the SDS.
In the current situation, the problem is first and foremost inflation, which makes it necessary to raise the interest rate to generate real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even if the rates of the ECB are reduced.
With regard to the level of delay, it is clear that, traditionally, small and medium-sized business companies, which are limited in terms of both the means to replenish and the options to correct economic behaviour, will pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written by Japanese hieroglyphs.
It's beautiful, it's lexic, and it's very difficult at the same time for those who are used to cyrillic or Latin.
So the new CX-5 crossboard, as well as any other brand model, is attractive from the outside, technically perfect inside.
Japan is already simply able, because of its "Japanese nature," to bring its attachment to the products of the countries of the rising sun to a state of full joy.
You can make any argument in favour of cars from other countries, and a man will even agree with those arguments in principle, but the whole conversation will be all over the final phrase, "But this is a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people must probably love not only technology, but all other Japanese.
Click with Bass's move, direct the vasabi food, collect the skates and put on her girlfriend's clothes, no, not in the kimono, of course, but on the canons of the street Japanese fashion: nice, creative and very sudden.
Perhaps the Japanese school form is the only form that girls are happy to wear after school.
It has amazing properties, both sensual and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of CX-5 is the radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But the image of the car is much more different than the new pattern of the headlamps and the rear lamps, where the car is instantly recognized in the flow of the cars.
As before, Mazda CX-5 seems very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensual, but the appearance has a tenderness.
You don't have to call the police.
While driving CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can only experience a cost-effective Japanese peace.
A 2.2 l diesel engine provides a high torque at a wide range of speeds.
However, the fuel consumption of this 175-litre engine is only 5.9. The power unit shall be equipped with an exclusively automatic transmission and a complete power train.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag...
In order to add some black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with a print from the Not Cross police tape.
In Mazda, however, you have put your best effort to ensure that you are not driving the CX-5 at the scene of your own accident.
In order to further improve the comfort, while maintaining excellent control, the suspension has redesigned the front and rear amortizers, as well as optimized the shape of the front lower lever.
The full drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and the engine at high speeds has been reduced by 13 per cent.
The bathing room in the flower or stripe is as boring as the budget sedan.
It's a different thing if a girl is ticking in a bathing suit with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game of role-playing.
She'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved structure for both front and rear seats, which provides an optimal reserve of space for both broad shoulders and long legs - who has what.
The long-legs will probably appreciate that the front of the central tunnel is now soft and not on the ankles in the virases.
The largest set of Mazda active security systems is proposed on CX-5.
Radar, laser and camera are used to identify a potential threat.
There is both adaptive lighting and a strip-out warning, and monitoring of dead areas, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best luggage bags in the class.
A suitable, with a minimum of leash, shall contain a load of 561. The rear seats shall be 4: 2: 4 - each section shall be equipped with a separate tensile lever - and shall increase the luggage compartment to 1560 °.
The cartoon character in Japan is called "kigurumi."
It's especially a kigurumi-pajamas.
You can have everything in it!
Of course you are.
But also, having fun with the little kids.
Or just walk around like that on the street...
Because it's so great when you have a choice, a fun dress, a good behavior, or a car.
We thank you for helping me prepare the material at the Kawaicat.
Kiev broke an atomic mind.
Kiev has officially declared Ukraine & apos; s refusal to cooperate with Russia on the development of the Hmelnitka nuclear power plant.
The Supreme is pleased on Wednesday since the second attempt, however, has voted in favour of the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
The third and fourth blocks had been redesigned as early as 2010-2012, but the project had not been implemented.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law that would terminate an agreement between 2010 and 2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of a third and fourth block on the Hmelnitka nuclear power plant.
The bill introduced by the Government was only possible by a second vote, for the first time being supported by 210 deputies, with a necessary minimum of 226, but then by 234 members of Parliament voted in favour of the draft.
The Hmelnitskaya nuclear power plant under the USSR for the original project was to have four power units of 1 GW with WER-type reactors, but only two were able to build.
The negotiations with Moscow on the development of the system led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and in 2011-2012, the Rada adopted the relevant laws.
As no funds were available in Ukraine & apos; s budget, it was intended that the blocks would have to be built on credit from the Russian side, but funds had never been allocated.
Following the coup d & apos; état in Kiev in February 2014 and the ensuing cooling between the two countries, Kiev began to close its relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, refusing to cooperate on the Hmelnitsk nuclear power plant and on the project for the construction of a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where the relationship has been maintained is the procurement of fuel in the Russian Federation for the existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (which provided about half of the country's electricity generation), as there is no substitute for Russian supplies so far as the Ukrainian NAEC Energoat is concerned.
The plans to reconstruct the Hmelnitsk nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been finalized: as early as 2014, negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS were announced in Kiev.
The United Nations Gensek is against the use of military force in the resolution of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, during a press conference, reported that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution," which gives AP his answer to a question about Russia's military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also reported that he would meet with the Foreign Ministers of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the MFA of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be on Syria," he said.
Earlier today, the Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Federation, Nikolai Bogdanovsky, reported that the General Staff did not exclude the possibility of establishing a future military base in Syria.
There are no such plans yet.
"But things can be," Mr. Bogdanovsky said.
Previously, "I" reported that the US did not trust Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to official Damascus was necessary to combat the terrorist group "Islamic State" prohibited in the Russian Federation.
More about the US's doubts about Russia's assistance to Syria, read in "I" "The Russian military presence in Syria is concerned about Washington.
OSCE reports to the PA on a possible meeting of the parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA), Arthur Herasimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentarians to discuss the situation in south-east Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," the TAS refers to Mr. Herasimov's words.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreements and for "a return to normal life in our countries."
On the question of whether, in his view, a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level, in the "Normandy format" or in the form of a contact group at the OSCE PA site, Mr. Herasimov noted that the dialogue had been held, there were Minsk agreements.
At the same time, the policy in Kiev is said to support all types of dialogue.
In the past, the representative of Ukraine in the negotiations, ex-President Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugani republics had not yet changed their positions in the trilateral negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties have been given mandates.
Yesterday, the Lower Novgorod Electoral Commission summarized the outcome of the urban Duma elections for the municipal district, allocating 12 parliamentary mandates on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral irregularities were made by representatives of the RFCC who accused them of "covering up fraud."
The opposition & apos; s comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the parties "Communist of Russia" refused to organize a referendum on the abolition of the payment for the bonuses of multi-family houses.
The city beat officially presented the results of the elections to the lower Novgorod horseman for the municipal electoral district.
A total of 1.03 million people were included in the electoral roll in Lower Novgorod, 746.7 thousand were issued to the district commissions and 268,000 were voted in the elections.
More than 11,000 ballots were declared invalid and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed to political parties, depending on the votes they received.
On the lists of "One Russia," six deputies in the proud are Dmitry Swatkowski, Dmitri Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rastroyev and Igor NK.
The only mandate of the LDDP was given to the party leader, Vladimir Girinovsky.
The two mandates of the RCF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and the member of the State Duma, Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of "just Russia" are given to Alexandra Oumov, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
These candidates must now, within five days, decide whether or not they will serve as members of the city Duma: if the mandate is terminated, they will move on to the next candidate on the list.
The Chairman of the gorisberkoma, Alexander McEev, informed the members of the Commission that he was introducing "telegrams to Girinovsky and others" on duty for the renunciation of mandates.
During the adoption of the electoral protocol, the representatives of the RCF reported multiple violations.
A member of the gorisberkoma, with the right to vote by the RCF, Leonid Krasnokutsky, proposed not to recognize the results of the vote in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that, on the order of the head of administration of the Sorm district, the entrance to the administration building, where the four district commissions were located, had been closed.
Neither the members of the Gos Udma, nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers, could have been present for long inside, and the resonance of a raid of the district's doors was shown on television.
All observers and members of the commissions, with the right to vote, were able to attend the meetings of the district commissions.
They had no access to the head until the vote had been completed and the district commissions had not yet come to issue their ballot papers.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"The head was then corrected, and the persons concerned could be present at all meetings," a member of the Kratarkoma of Natalia Andrušin.
The Communists objected that, in a blocked administrative building for more than four hours, a member of the Zak Assembly of the Ludmila Aristov region had been illegally held, and a statement had been made to the investigating committee.
The opposition was also dismayed that, in a number of UIkov on election day, the boxes began to be sealed at 6-7 a.m., with ballot papers on them for early voting.
At the same time, no members of the commissions, with the right to vote and observers, have been notified, so they have come to the start of the elections at 8: 00 a.m.
The Communists are confident that in the morning before the opening of the polling stations, the ballot papers could be put unchecked.
However, the mountains have not found any irregularities with the introduction of unrecorded ballot papers, which has already dealt with more than 124 complaints on various grounds, according to Alexander McEev.
Nor did the members of the Commission support the proposal of Maria Popova, a colleague from "Fair Russia," to issue amendments to regional legislation through the brisket to make clear the time for the opening of the early-ballot envelopes, which then entered the box.
"As an initiative of your own, at least go to the CEC," she was advised by Ms. Popova Alexander McAev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the Commission for the Rights of the Child, Sergei Samohin, had come to the Chair with high-profile accusations, who had been screaming that the beating had ignored dozens of complaints and covered the falsification of the elections.
"You're not here at a rally, be careful." The president of the beating was offended.
As a result, the protocol was almost unanimously adopted.
Before 27 September, a beating is required to approve the overall results of the elections, followed by the first meeting of the city Duma of the Lower Novgorod of the sixth, to be held within three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the city electoral commission denied the political party "Communist Russia" to register an action group for a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to bring two questions to the attention of the undercities: whether they agreed that the fees for the carbonage of the multi-family houses should be "immediately cancelled" and that the tariffs on housing and utilities "be frozen before 2020."
However, the jurist of the Duma, Irina Maslov, explained that the treatment of the "Communists of Russia" was contrary to the law.
The FEx is mixed, with a decrease in projections for 2016.
FederEx reported on the untiring results of the last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced the forecast of annual returns due to the decline in demand for freight services and the increase in costs in its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it was planning to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FederEx reported that he would hire 50,000 temporary employees for the holidays.
Her shares were cheap by about 2.5 per cent on pre-bid loans 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FederEx Corp. stated that he planned to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, a 20-cent reduction from the previous forecast.
Analysts estimated $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The decrease in the forecast is despite an average increase of 4.9 per cent, which will come into effect on 4 January, and an increase in the charges for ground transportation of heavy or heavy cargo, which will begin in November.
The company stated that it was still planning an increase in revenue over the previous year, as a result of cost reductions, increased gross income and increased online trade.
The Chairman and CEO, Fred Smith, stated that the company "worked in a stable manner in view of the weak economic conditions, especially in production and world trade, compared to the forecast."
The plans for the recruitment of the labour force on the holidays were announced the day after the competition, UPS, announced that they were planning to hire an additional 95,000 staff, approximately the same as they were employed last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31, FEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than a year earlier.
The stock income was $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 per stock conducted by Zacks Investment Research with a survey of 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FEx has been affected in recent years by the decline in the international emergency transport sector, which has led to a lack of gross income growth in its express transport unit.
However, the Internet purchase boom has dramatically improved the results of the FEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport revenues increased by 29 per cent, but operating income remained generally unchanged due to increased costs of large-scale shipping and self-insurance.
The rapid transport unit received higher income due to higher base rates, while in the cargo sector, income fell due to higher labour costs.
In pre-bid terms, about an hour before the opening of the FEx stock exchange, it fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
They closed the Tuesday, falling 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the 11 June record.
At the most expected meeting in a few years, the leaders of the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from the Honduran red tree, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost 10 years.
At one end, a rich, decorated meeting room, high in two floors, will have a wallpaper on the United States.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues, should place the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank received a double request from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to keep stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third assignment may be an unknown factor in the almost projected decision that will be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to break off from the priceless incentive provided by almost zero short-term interest rates since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show a strong growth in the economy, recent shocks in the world financial markets may keep the already cautious leaders of the Federal System from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds - even by only a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsay M. Piegza, the main economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co., a broker.
"But I think if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait on," she noted.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve system, which in itself is causing financial market fluctuations.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg projected an increase in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, are expected to keep the Federal System from doing so, while the key indicator shows only an estimated 30 per cent chance of rapid recovery.
This may lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal System raises the rate, provided that decision makers do not mitigate the impact by saying that the next increase will not be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow-Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The takeoff was triggered by expectations that those who set out the Federal System's strategy would leave the bet this week, John Lonski, the main economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It would be a surprise if the Federal System raised the stakes at this point in time," he noted.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve is to do so, "they will have to go far in adopting their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so that they don't panic."
Other experts were of the view that an increase in the rate could help to calm financial markets, as it would lead to uncertainty as to how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal system seemed to have been inclined to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, taking the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions, which could prove the strength of the US's recovery.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer that she expected an increase this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
While new jobs slowed in August, the growth of the labour market was stable this year.
Unemployment had been reduced to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years, and at almost the level considered full employment in the Federal System.
The increase in wages shows signs of an acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank & apos; s 2 per cent annual target, the Federal System management stated that the key reason was the temporary effect of a sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher rates and needs them, given the decline in the labour market," noted Ian Sheferdson, the main economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow-Jones average for shares in industrial companies fell by a total of 16 per cent of the relatively high level in May, as investors feared that the Chinese economy might be slowing down global growth.
The market has partially restored its position this month, and the Dow-Jones index is now about 10% below the high May value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve System, market resentment further complicates the difficult calculation of the period of interest rate rise.
"In the absence of information on what has happened in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have started to make a fuss at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher of UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former member of the Federal Reserve System.
It is now projected that they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
"There is great uncertainty about what the impact on the American economy may have, and they have little or no reliable data after the recent events in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal System and should not be technically taken into account in these decisions.
But in fact, the Federal Reserve has become a global financial authority.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere indication from then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve system could "stifle" its monetary expansion had caused market shocks around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve system will not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other Headquarters banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process - "art rather than science" - was noted by Zachary Karabell, the head of Envestnet Inc, a company that is involved in global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "there have been cases in the history of the Federal Reserve System of excessive reactions to financial market movements that do not seem to be linked to economic principles."
A member with the right to vote of an influential Federal Open Market Committee, who insisted on an increase in the rate, cited as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Federal System to reduce its base rate by 0.75 per cent in three meetings, "despite the limited and identifiable impact on growth in the US," said Laker.
One year later, the leaders of the Federal System had reversed those reductions.
The federal reserve system should focus on stability only in times of major crises, such as the collapse of the market in 2008, "said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the interest-rate committee in the Bank of England.
The last panic didn't get close to that level, he said.
"You would, of course, not want to be in a situation where you are afraid of rising rates because of the shock that markets are experiencing," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute of World Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should be ahead of events.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often called the Thai Costco, LAX-C is an wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Ty Town.
The market / warehouse is a store where you can buy everything at once, offering a dizzy choice of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even a car department if you need to buy oil for the engine.
The store is huge, and it'll take more than an hour to go through all the lines.
If shopping causes you to starve, buy some food at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The cooking department in the store (good and low-cost) is close to the cash register and offers various options for taking off.
What is it suggested: Do you need anything, anything, Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
The prices of goods are reasonable, and quite a lot of goods are sold in bulk.
Fresh products include sensitive Asian and local Thai herbs, fruits and many others.
The meatloaf is as diverse as the fish, and the personnel behind the counter will clean up and make the fish, and even burn it for you if you want.
The usual part of the store is placed under an impressive freezer, where you find frozen curry leaves, bitter pumpkin and gallagal, whole duck, fish, beef blood and yellow, pig carcasses, icra, local sausage, semi-factories, and so on.
The buyers are: the owners and the chef of restaurants, as well as the families and individual buyers.
The wide passage includes both shops and forklifts.
It's a fresh, durian montong next to the exit.
The site is located in the industrial part of Los Angeles, adjacent to the outskirts of the Chinese quarter and the business centre of the city, a few blocks from Philip The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own site, which he shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although there may be a lot of people in the store, it's usually easy to find a parking lot.
The Speaker of the State Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, concedes that the US is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of refugees will go to Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a supporter of conspirological theories, but the question is self-evident: is it not Europe that is the ultimate goal of those who, with such manic persistence in recent years, have destabilized the situation in North Africa and the Middle East?" he asked.
"I'm sure someone thought and knew that the flows of refugees, these miserable and disadvantaged people who are fleeing death, are going to the well-being of the EU," he added.
Naryshkin asked: "Have many European political leaders spoken openly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally sinking their countries?"
"No, old Europe, with a rare exception, prefers silence," he said.
In Naryshkin & apos; s view, NATO is flouting many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe has, unfortunately, for a long and impartial time been looking at and looking at the way in which the NATO military boots, which have been set up according to NATO standards, have also melted moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law," the Speaker stressed.
Government forces and their loyal paramilitary forces are being opposed by the rebels, who are mostly Islamists.
The terrorist group "Islamic State" prohibited in Russia later joined the opponents of the Syrian Government.
The US supports the rebels, who are both opposed to Assad and IG.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The Syrian President has given the reason for the West's hostility to Russia.
The Western claims against countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign States.
This view was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, First Canal, "Russia 24," NTV, "Russia Now," "TASS," Interfax "and" Russian newspaper. "
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners or sovereign States.
In those countries, he would like to remove one person and put another in his place, which would be for the benefit of Western countries rather than for his country, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of Western media since the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
For them, he said, Russian President Vladimir Putin "turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a king, a dictator who suppressed the Russian opposition, which came to power on a non-democratic basis, even though he was elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West."
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West's constant statements that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he did, at the request of the people, not by a decision of the United States, the United Nations Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
"If the people want them to stay, the President remains, or if not, he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that they were being cooperated with.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
With regard to Iran & apos; s military support, the Syrian leader noted that the country supported the Syrian State in the political, economic and military spheres.
He denied the allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is providing us with military equipment.
"There is, of course, an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always taken place," he explained.
As for the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-igilov coalition, from the home of the United States," Assad said.
The number of deaths was over 230,000 and the number of refugees was 11.5 million.
A part of the territory has been seized by the terrorist group "Islamic State," which is prohibited in Russia.
An international coalition led by the United States is putting air strikes on the EG positions.
In Utah, 12 people were killed by the flood.
In the U.S. state of Utah, at least 12 people were killed as a result of the floods.
Another is considered missing, and is being transferred to Fox 13 by Salt Lake City.
The water washed out a number of cars with people in Washington County.
One of them, the van where the family was, stopped in a dangerous area near the water, and the flow suddenly overcame it.
The youngest victim was four years old.
All of the deaths were in the Colorado City and Hildale areas, which were hit by a poem.
Three children were also reported to have been rescued.
There are 650 teams involved in search and rescue.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
United States Secretary of State John Kerry held a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
Reuters report this with reference to a member of the State Department, John Kirby.
It is noted that the subject of the discussion was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide further details.
In doing so, he stated that the US had tools for "further isolation of Russia" if it supported Syrian President Bashar Assad, and passed on RIA News.
According to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lavrov, in a conversation with Kerry, reiterated the need to establish a single front against terrorist groups operating in the country.
There were also discussions on ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis and possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula.
In addition, some issues of a bilateral nature were raised.
Previously, United States officials stated that Russia was building up its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about the increase in Moscow's support for Assad.
In Washington, it was stated that if Russia continued to support Assad, it would be further isolated from the international community.
In response, the Russian President's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said that the country would not be in international isolation.
The rebels are in favour of the overthrow of the Assad regime.
A part of the territory was seized by the terrorist organization Islamic State.
An international coalition led by the United States is attacking EG positions from the air.
The Borodai called the information of the American newspaper a slander on the Arkova.
The former President of the Government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People & apos; s Republic, Alexander Borodai, denied information that was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said that in a telephone interview with Lentyr's correspondent.
The Washington Post note is beautiful, because it's completely relegated.
The former Defence Minister of NAM, Igor Strokova, of course, did not link or "leave" him from the territory of the republics of Donbas in a very high mood, without ropes, without three feet of money, which is attributed to him by different characters, he said.
According to Borodia, the question of the Arrow in a conversation with a reporter of the American newspaper was indeed a matter of concern.
"Yes, I said that Sturkova was urgently required to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," said the former head of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why an American correspondent had decided to write that the Arrow had been taken to Russian territory "bound."
I suspect it's a provocation.
If it is not a provocation, it is an astonishing misunderstood word, because I have stressed that the Arrow has left on its own, "the Borodai observed.
"It's a slander on me and on the Arrow," he concluded.
Previously on The Washington Post, an article was published that included the words of Borodia that he had forcibly taken Shurkov to Russian territory.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he had been forced to tie his brother-in-law.
The Polish authorities have begun to search for a train with the Nazi gold.
The Polish logging industry has begun to take out trees above the underground tunnel, where there is some evidence of a third-reich gold train.
The work began on Tuesday, 15 September, and reports to Reuters.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to verify the reliability of the rumours about the railway composition with the treasure.
The trains may be equipped with weapons and valuable minerals.
On 31 August, the Governor of the Polish Nisznesil voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that new evidence of a gold train was no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities have decided to set up a search area.
Three days earlier, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Peter Zhukovsky, stated that the same train with the gold of the Third Reich referred to in the legends had been found by local bookseekers with a "probability of 99 per cent."
Zhokowski noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the jewellery was found, they would be the property of the State Treasury, and the treasure would not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of a law firm reported to the authorities of the Polish city of Valbjii that they had found a train in a raged tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The main drug dealer of the Russian Federation proposed that the sale of tobacco to persons up to the age of 21 be prohibited.
The Russian main drug dealer proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Eugenia Brun noted that "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - is particularly harmful until this age."
This is what he said on the live radio station "Says Moscow," commenting on information that the Speaker of Soufeda Valentine Matvienko supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years of age.
A man is unevenly mature.
You can be in the army from the age of 18, and the man is physically ready for it.
He has been mentally ready for a full life in society since he was 21.
"It is known from scientific evidence that the brain, his biochemistry, is only finally growing up by the age of 21," Bryn noted.
Previously, a member of the Public Chamber and the project leader "Tresv Russia", Sultan Hamzayev, informed "News" that Matvienko had supported the initiative to raise the age of the sale of alcohol and "agreed, in cooperation with the Public Chamber, to raise this issue again on the site of the upper house of Parliament."
According to the activist, a working group will soon be established in the Federation Council to draft a draft law under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the Child Information Protection Act
The resident of Novosibersk requested the Regional Prosecutor's Office to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law on the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development, and a statement was made on 16 September by the correspondent, Sib.f.m.
The author stated that, on 26 August 2015, he had purchased from the "Chitai City" store on the Red Prospect of the Bible, published by the Russian Bible Society in 2013.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his view, violated the FZ "On the Protection of Children from Information Harmful to their Health and Development."
On 16 September, the application was accepted by the Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office of Novosibirsk.
A response to a request from a resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurd nature of the law itself, as the complainant commented to the correspondent, Sib.f.m.
In addition, it is a well-founded problem that will break into society.
It's gonna start reading the Bible, which it's never done before.
The Rio Grandi Pediatrician Union of Brazil promotes healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS has developed a scandalous method by which it is intended to convince women of the need for full food during breastfeeding: the method is to show images of infants sucking their breasts, which are written with images of harmful food.
The breast milk consists of various proteins, fat, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to high energy needs, pregnant and pregnant women are encouraged to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that a single increase in calorie is not the only change in diet that mothers have to make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baelor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy nutrition for pregnant women actually affected the exposure of children to genes and prevented their tumours from developing.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the child & apos; s immune system has been identified.
A school bus was hit by a train under Hamburg.
A train hit a school bus near Hamburg, which was stuck on the railway road.
A 23-year-old woman driver, who realized that she could not move, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute after that, they had a collision in front of them.
One of the students recorded it on the video.
The accident caused a panic among the students.
Some children started crying and running along the side of the road.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was struck by a miracle, except one passenger of a train who was slightly injured.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300,000 euros.
The doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for the prohibition of boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown, Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in a fight with the Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category of up to 57.15 kg on Friday ended with the victory of Magali with a nokaut in the 12th round.
Brown got into a hospital with a brain injury.
His condition was considered critical and he was connected to the life support equipment.
In the professional ring, Brown held 22 victories, only two defeated, and one battle ended with a tenderloin.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second time that Australian boxers have been killed in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student, Braidon Smith, died of injuries in the ring.
The AMA now recommends not to engage in this sport, but rather to ban it at all, in its view.
I understand that this is not the case, as the Vice-President of the organization, Stephen Parnis, said.
But as the box now exists, there will always be situations where the athlete is bleeding or brain trauma, which leads to either death or severe damage.
For that reason, the AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that brings together medical practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, Sergey Naryshkin, called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians to be unacceptable.
He said that by speaking at the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We regard this as unacceptable action as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"This should not be repeated because it is a manifestation of political disdain and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue," the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the members of the OSCE PA to re-establish the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get the moral back into politics.
Let us bring dialogue and the law back to the practice of international communication.
Let us return humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
"The double never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
"First, on a negotiated solution to the Ukrainian crisis and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group," said Naryshkin.
He also noted that the OSCE must be commended.
"This is almost the only common ground where we still discuss how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician stressed.
It will be recalled that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, at Ulaanbaatar, until 18 September.
I've been enjoying the victory for a couple of days.
The World Champion on the light athletics of Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumph for a 24-year-old light athlete from Barnaul Sergei SHUBENKOVA.
He has been able to win a number of records at his 110-metre crown distance, and the first in the history of the national barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final phase of the Diamond League, taking third place.
"New News" asked Shubenkov to share his impressions from the season.
Sergei, is the season not over for you yet?
Yeah, I'm gonna do the World War Games that will be held in Korea in October, and then I'm gonna be thinking about rest.
I'm going to be at home in Barnaul, but being at home is a very different condition.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You once said autumn was your favorite time of year.
The end of August, early September, is a great time.
The passion after the main start of the season has been boiled, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressing.
You can compete for pleasure, on "sloppy."
Plus, you know, it's about time...
Do you have any fatigue?
It's a special season, a lot of positive emotions.
Tired by the end of the season always accumulates.
And it doesn't matter what I did more, whether I won or lost.
Every competition is stress.
Regular flights, moves - all of this doesn't go away for the body.
You're tired of being physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, on the rise.
I'm just happy!
By the time they finished the Beijing World Cup, you come back a lot?
It happens.
And you journalists don't let me forget that.
But in general, I think that a bad athlete who lives on his old victories is going through his successful races over and over again.
I've been enjoying the victory for a couple of days, and we have to move on.
The preparation for this wonderful season was very different from that used to be?
I can't say there was something so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter season.
He was trained first at home in Barnaul, then on a run, then again at home.
It's all the same.
But the challenge with the coach was to try to get to a new level that I haven't been to yet.
Almost all winter time was spent laying the base.
We ran a bunch of cross-ups, did a general-physical training exercise, which included both traction and a seat and a back.
Then they took up the barrier training, and they did a lot of technical training.
The way the rivals were, were they watching?
I always try to do it, and there's no problem with it in the Internet era.
I saw the European Winter Championship, and the French took the whole pedestal in the barrier sprint!
I thought we should do something, take this company down.
With every start in this season, you added and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
My last season is about the same.
There's no such thing as me running first 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always turn my form over gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All of the work was focused on that result.
But the paradox is, like, you feel like you're ready for a move, and at a competition, you don't always get ready.
What was it like at the London Olympics?
I, to be honest, that semi-final race (Shubenkov couldn't make it to the finals.
It was very good, I could actually run out of 13 seconds.
Even if I had done it again at the time, I would have been the bronze preacher of the game.
But not lucky.
You remember your first World Cup?
What about it?
It was in Tegu.
I really wanted to get into the final, there was a maximum program.
And he fell off the morning, in the pre-race.
That's when I realized that to break and not to break my head means not to go anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the World Cup in Moscow, he was released to the final with a better time.
I remember my feelings in front of the decisive race: I really wanted to win "gold"!
How is it, by developing a decent speed, not losing your head, not disable?
And that's the hardest part.
You have to be very careful, focused on technology, so that there are no barriers.
I noticed that when you're not on the result, you're on the process, it's so much easier.
And the best part is when you feel like you're running and it's like you're doing it.
I promise you, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the deep are trying to move closer to the capital after the first major success.
Have you ever thought like that?
It's better at home anyway.
I have no idea where I'm going without my coach, who needs me?
It might be good to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be happy with what I have.
How long have you been together with the Clovtsov?
Since I was 12 years old, since I came to a light athletic.
In fact, first I trained with his wife, who worked with the kids, and then she passed me on.
I started with a sprint, then I jumped in length, three.
The child's polyboria was -- it's when the ball is being melted, it's jumping into the length of the place...
I tried running with the barriers at 14, and I liked it.
Since the first race, it has been possible to meet the second-grade standard.
I did.
There's never been any fear of barriers?
It was a good time to deal with them.
But there's always been a lot of work on technology.
There's been a lot of suffering over this one.
But there's no way out of this routine.
The tech needs to be kept up all the time so I can wake up at night, I can get up and run through the barriers.
All those who saw you race in Beijing say it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I usually don't review my race, and I couldn't hold on.
But efficiency needs to be further worked on - there is no limit to perfection.
Don't you fear that a victory one year before the Olympic Games will be a heavy burden?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
If you have chosen this road, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, there's no need to feel any extra cargo.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanakwilli
Well, I'm not that naive to be amazed by the reaction to an interview that took place in Ukraine.
People are angry, I know their bread is not food - give it to me, give it to the enemy.
And even though I didn't lie to the flag, and that's exactly the same thing, a million times I've been talking here, and I've never called anyone a bastard directly, I'm not the same person.
All my pseudo-friends are in a moment, just a second out.
The pressing I'm exposed to is so strong that even I, when I saw a kid, think people are full of white.
It's like walking, walking, and you're being attacked by a crowd, and you're gonna be a little bit of a bitch.
But I need to know, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a howitzer, I'm old man, I'm afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
I've always had my best self-sufficiency, so give it to me.
And giving passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson can only be a jerk.
I wish I, the best journalist, had a hard job.
A week ago, in Kiev, Otar Kushanakvili gave a sharp description of Crimean events:
What they did to the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I take it that the reference to how Hrushchev's drunk was trying to sign is not in any way part of the general picture of the human dorm.
It's like coming to the neighbor and taking his living space...
The war from the Kremlin has gone, and it will only end there.
I'm almost 100% sure, like in the summer of 2008, she started by calling some bastard from the Kremlin.
I have an idea who it might be...
The Cobzone doesn't have much to live on.
I don't understand, he's Putin's greatest artist, why he needs to lay his hands on Putin.
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, they took down his monument.
Of course, people remember him as an insult to their little homeland.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise is the seventh leader in the ratings, despite the Ninth's attempts to cover the game of leaders on Today Show.
The release of Carl Stefanović and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the consequences of the Liberal Party's release of the leader's seat was not able to increase the current rate much.
The morning show was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott.
The competition, Sunrise, with leading David Koch and Samantha Armitage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasting, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture seemed to be of little importance to Australian viewers, with the Sunrise audience having 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to the Today audience of 33,000.
Today was a little more than its rate on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers, compared to 314,000 in Today.
It's the most interesting thing that's been going on all morning.
The winds of change are more powerful than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the clarification!

An important news for Seven was an amazing 800 Words debut with a former star on "Packed to the Rafters" by Eric Thomson.
A new drama about the recently widowed father of the family, who decided to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics were wondering if Thomson could handle a popular show on his own, without a Rafter star, Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a loud answer to "yes."
The X Factor Seven remained in strong positions with 1136 million viewers, easily bypassing The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For Seven, success and failure mixed on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (from 5: 00 to 5: 30) of the new television-cathedral, which Andrew O'Keefi had been running, had gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 17: 30 to 18: 00), the figure jumped up to 623,000 viewers - enough to win a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).

Three finalists are unanimous that "The Bachelor" Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is solved...?
Lana Jevon-Fellus, Sarah McKay and Snejan Markosky may have been given an accident to figure out which one of them will win at the bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will end up in the "bachelor" is surrounded by a veil of secret.
And the three girls who came to the end, of course, remain silent about which one of them got his last rose.
But when we met with Sarah McKay, Snejana Markosky, and Lana Jevons-Flowes on the day before the three girls would have to stay two, they might have unwittingly given a clue about the winner.
Sam Wood remains silent until the end of Thursday.
All three women come into a lyrical mood, telling us why Wood is a perfect man, while referring to his sense of humor, commitment, family values, vitality as the reasons why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
But with their answers to the question, "If not for you, who should have the last rose of Wood?" they might have been reluctant to tell which one of them actually won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeeves-Fellas and Markosky have no doubt called McKay the perfect couple for Wood.
There's been a good relationship between Sarah and Sam since day one.
"From the moment I was a member, I felt the energy (Sarah) and the energy of Sam, and I realized that they were very good for each other, and I had no doubt about it all over the show," said Jeeves-Flowes.
"Sarah is a very open man, with her easy and fun," added Markoski.
I saw them together, there's really a attraction between them.
They feel fine and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna make a great couple.
McKay himself said that, thanks to her home visits last week, she realized that Wood might be "the man."
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realized it was not just a game, I believed him with all my heart," she says.
The question is, who should Wood choose, if it's not her, she answered with a mysterious answer.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same, and Snejan and Lana are equally worthy of it.
The show "The Bachelor" is released on Wednesday, 19: 30 on TV.
Originally published under the name "Sarah is the best choice of Sam Wood?"
Jarrid Hain had several options to start a career at the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after his move to the United States - as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hane chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsul, and it seems that it was a wise decision.
Some of the coaches would have left Hane on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball that a former Australian rugby player allowed on the first return of a panta in a win-win game with Minnesota with a 20-3 score.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another chance to get the pant back, and also put it in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed himself on the good side and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of having a rookie in front of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hain at a press conference after the match.
A special reporter for the 49ers club, Cam Inman, reported that Hayne also received support from the coordinator of the special teams Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and to think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost the ball on the back of the panta by the Minnesota Wickings team during the first quarter.
This is the beginning of the NHL Hane debut and its many Australian fans were clearly not counting on it.
It was seen that Hayne was fighting, leaving the field after losing the ball, and later he told the leader of the "Hamish and Andy" show on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, which could not imagine a more unsuccessful start for a career in the NFL.
"It happens, you just think about the next game and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared his failure to his debut in the "Oriin" series in 2007, when a shot of the ball in his credit zone was attempted by Queensland.
In the end, this experience has proved to be very useful for a 27-year-old player.
Hane took a picture with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a picture at Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights.
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of use of weapons at the Siberian airport.
The open challenge to President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his attempts to develop democracy were stopped.
There were clashes between migrants and the police on the Hungarian border.
The refugees protested at the border of Serbia near the Hungarian settlement of Rezke, which had become a clash with law enforcement officials.
As a result, the Hungarian police used water and tear gas and transferred Reuters.
Migrants are stoning police officers and trying to take down the fence at the border.
The site of the clashes was being supported, and the police were responding to the aggression of migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees were able to break through the police cordon, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reporting BBC.
The authorities allowed migrants to enter Croatian territory and to transport them from there to the right country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament strengthened its legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the military to be involved in the protection of State borders, for the prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, and for an accelerated procedure for the processing of asylum requests.
The Hungarian Court had already found one migrant guilty of illegal crossing of the Hungarian-Serbian border, so that he would be deported and would not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider, in the near future, the transfer of border protection to the Hungarian armed forces of the Parliament.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a barrier with barbed wire of 175 km on the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian admitted to the largest cyber attack in the history of the United States.
The accused in the largest cyber-attack in the history of the United States, Russian man Vladimir Drinkman, confessed to stealing over 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During the trial before the Federal Court of New Jersey, Drinkman confessed to conspiracy to obtain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, a Russian man spoke of a conspiracy with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen accused of cyber-attacks on 15 companies.
The total damage caused by the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"The defendants, such as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, are a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman is facing 30 years of imprisonment, as well as a fine of a million dollars.
In sentencing, the court will take into account the recognition of a Russian person and may reduce his time.
Drinkman's sentence will be announced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitri Smiliane, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt for the crimes he is charged with.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk with Russia's support for Bashar Assad's regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, United States Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks exacerbating and expanding the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power," a message published on the United States Department of State website.
Kerry confirmed the US's commitment to combating the Islamic State (whose activities are prohibited by the Supreme Court in Russia) in a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad "will never be a reliable member of the" coalition. "
Also during a telephone call, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria could be resolved only through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of support for the Assad regime.
The previous day, the White House press secretary, Joshua Ernest, threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest suggested joining the international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the "Islamic State."
In recent times, the media have often reported the presence of Russian soldiers on Syrian territory.
To which the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, has stated that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and have been helping Syrians to develop technology to use it against Islamists.
Four were killed when the police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the proposed new Constitution of the country, as the official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on the evening of Tuesday in Rupandei County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the head of the district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered from a police station, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police had used tear gas, then shot in the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why the rubber bullets that are known to be killed, but they have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
This clash was the last in a few weeks of violent protests in southern, plain Nepal, where the Madezi people claim that the new provinces under the new Constitution will reduce their political influence.
The protests also took place in western Nepal, among the Taru people who wish to have a state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
On August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the provinces, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centrally administered for several centuries.
The new Constitution had been being drafted since 2008, but the legislature had accelerated the process following a devastating earthquake that had claimed the lives of thousands of people in April.
The legislature voted in favour of the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said that a new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk is planning to create an enterprise with 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as a centre of the chemical industry and has a well-developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sayansk was led by a new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
He presented the results of the first year of work, new projects and prospects to the correspondent "The Area."
Oleg Valerievich, how did you start working as mayor?
I first reviewed the results of the financial and economic audits and initiated an independent audit of the local budget.
The municipal property was then audited.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce documentation to five days.
Previously, the court papers could have been on for months.
Activities have been developed to improve the income base and optimize costs.
In November last year, a retreat of the Government was held in Sayansk, which addressed the economic and social development of the Territory.
There was no project design document (PSD) per site in the city.
Without this, Sayansk could not participate in federal programmes.
We started by preparing PSD for roads, kindergarten, northern sewer and water.
Road work on two sites is already under way.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July this year, 105 babies were born in Saiansk.
This positive demography has not been observed in the city for the past 27 years.
So the question of the availability of places in kindergartens is one of the most important issues today.
Since 1 September, it has been closed for major maintenance of kindergarten No. 10, with a capacity of 320 places.
The cost of repairs is estimated at 86 million roubles.
The city has not yet received such funds.
Last year, after the renovation, kindergarten No. 23 opened and is now attended by 200 children.
The renovation was made on a co-financing basis from the regional and local budgets, at a cost of more than 67 million roubles.
With the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional Government, funds were sought for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the People's Initiatives programme helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its entry, we plan to eliminate the priority of children between the ages of one and a half and three.
We don't have any witnesses for three to seven years of age.
Do investors have an interest in the Territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction of the city should be done primarily by the Saeyan enterprises, which are the ones that need to be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment home for orphans in the Leningrad neighbourhood is being put into operation.
In the area of construction, I would add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarya, which is part of the programme for the construction of an eco-class housing.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 blocks will begin soon.
In total, we have announced the construction of 10,000 square metres of housing for those who wish to participate in the programme.
One of the conditions is that housing should not be more than 30,000 roubles per square metre, which includes a "key" cut.
If we can handle the volume, we can continue to be involved in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
The Sayan pig complex was built and sold in 2004 for no price.
We're working with the Public Prosecutor's Office to challenge this deal.
Especially since the land under the target is in federal property.
Work is under way with Moscow, and the issue of the transfer of 88 hectares to regional ownership is being decided, followed by the transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor ready to invest in the reconstruction and launch of the 1.5 billion roubles project.
With a pig complex, we'll have 900 jobs, which will be a big help to the city.
In Saiansk, has the institution of social partnership been developed?
We have some 140 treaties of socio-economic partnership.
A number of projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Enterprises such as the East-Centre ZAO, the Novo-Zimin TEC, the Sayan Broiler, the PK MDF provide tangible support, and the management of these enterprises is responding to all requests.
In the immediate course of the day of the City of the Saiyan Broiler, the city was given children's towns, and East Centre has been repairing the horse yard, where specialists are dealing with the children of Ipatherapy, spending more than 1 million roubles.
Sponsorship has made it possible to improve the area of the city & apos; s ZAGSa.
The sponsors have helped to celebrate City Day in a beautiful way.
As in the old days, a parade took place with the participation of urban communities and organizations.
A summer book of the city, a book of the Saiyan poets, was released.
The first-time builders and people who have made a significant contribution to the development of Sajansk have been given commemorative medals.
The price also participates in the urban charity fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800,000 roubles are aimed at supporting talented children, helping children in need of high-cost treatment, and supporting children from low-income families.
How are human resources problems in the social sphere being addressed in Sajansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and teaching subjects in the city.
In order to address the human resources issue, the provision of housing for professionals is essential.
Over the past year, we have provided five medical apartments, and four teachers have been provided with office accommodation.
We have a housing programme that can be privatized in five years.
The plans include a redesign of the building, which will build eight more apartments for teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the "Housing for the Russian family" programme.
In the future, building a home for employees in the budget sector.
The most important thing is that there is a working team in the city with which I can deal with the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
A bill on the indexing of social pensions in the light of higher prices has been introduced in Duma.
A bill has been introduced in the State Duma to indexe social pensions every year since 1 February, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document, a member of the Fair Russia, Alexander Lomakin-Ruzyatsev, also proposes that pensions be further indexed on 1 April if the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum is higher than the rate of increase in the prices of goods and services.
The social pension index, in accordance with the legislation in force, is carried out annually on 1 April, taking into account the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum of a retired person in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law introduced to the lower house introduced the indexation of social pensions in the light of the rate of increase in consumer prices.
The first indexation is carried over to 1 February and the second is held on 1 April.
The OSCE head of the PA has stated to Mogerini that sanctions against parliamentarians should not be imposed.
In an official letter to the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogerini Speaker of the OSCE PA, Ilkka Canerva, stated that sanctions against legislators participating in Assembly activities were not acceptable.
This was reported to the journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar Nikolai Kovalev.
According to TASS, European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, have been signed in support of the Canerva position.
"There's already enough support," Kowalev said.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PA had expressed his intention to collect the signatures of deputies, who had indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians should not be imposed.
In particular, Kowalev noted that Kanerva had promised to raise the issue to the level of EU leadership and "send a petition."
NHC reports a 60 per cent probability of a cyclone south of the Green Mouse Islands
The high-pressure front of the low-pressure region, about 350 miles (560 km) south of the south end of the Green Cape Islands, is likely to be 60 per cent of the tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, and reported on Tuesday to the United States National Hurricane Centre.
Another well-defined area of low pressure, approximately in the middle between the Green Mice and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 per cent potential for tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, is reported by synoptics from Miami.
Google is launching a double-donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launching of a $11 million donation campaign for humanitarian organizations to help refugees in Europe who are fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has taken an uncharacterised personal approach by announcing the collection campaign on his blog.
Instead of a statement made by one of the leaders, Google Rita Masood, who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We got on dubious trains and buses, had hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has increased, many people such as my family are in desperate need of assistance.
Donations will be given to four non-profit organizations that assist refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million in donations until the amount on the Google / Refugee page reached $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-stricken Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.

Diabetes with little obesity can help with obesity surgery.
The benefits of obesity surgery for people with low obesity with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that diabetes with little obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
"Death statistics are not immediately available," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who wrote about a new study in the JAMA Surgery editor column.
The obesity surgery, or the bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce the stomach size.
They reduce the sense of hunger and the ability of organizations to absorb food.
In a few years, the bariatric surgery has proved to be effective for type 2 diabetes treatment, but the main studies have been carried out among people with morphine obesity with a body mass index (MRI) 35 or more.
The MRI, the weight measure relative to growth, is considered normal at a value of between 18.5 and 24.9.
The IMT 25 or more suggests that human weight is overweight, and people with an IMT over 30 are considered to be obesity.
You can count your IMT here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare the two types of bariatric surgery - the schunting of the stomach and the hand gastractomy with the treatment of diabetes 2 in people with little obesity.
The average IMT value for those who were subjected to surgical intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, the IMT remains at about 29 for those who have received non-surgical treatment for diabetes.
Of those who had undergone the operation, 36 per cent had been fully treated for diabetes and 28 per cent had been partially cured.
In the group that received medication, for comparison, only 1 per cent of the total treatment for diabetes was observed, and only about 2 per cent of the total treatment for diabetes.
In addition, the blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LNP cholesterol were generally better in the surgical group, "the authors say.
Researchers also controlled levels of Hemoglobin A1s in the blood, which reflect levels of blood sugar in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better held below 7%, and researchers write.
After surgical intervention, the average level of Hemoglobin A1c fell from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8 per cent.
But the best glycemic control indicators, reflected by good levels of Hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi-Cheng-soo's research manager and colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared with a group that had completed a sleeve gastractomy, the shuntout group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), achieved a greater decrease in MRI (7.4% against 5.1) and Hemoglobin A1c (3.1% against 2.1%), and was also closer to a complete remission of diabetes (46.9% against 16.7%).
Although the new study does not show the benefits of a surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of people with excess body weight in Sweden that surgical treatment does indeed lead to an increase in life expectancy, as Blackstone of the College of Medicine in Phoenix, University of Arizona reports.
According to a Swedish study, for those with obesity who had chosen to intervene, the probability of death over 15 years was about 29 per cent lower than for the group that used more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this was encouraging for people with MRI below 35 interested in such a procedure.
"The report is very important here because it states that such surgical intervention is safe in a group with low IMT, where there is no high risk of death or kidney disease," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient's IMT is in the range of 27 to 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to make people take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they have accumulated the genetic changes that lead to obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse that.
In the Mouse, the robbers took out the noises and 9 million roubles.
In the Mouse, the robbers attacked the people of the house and stole 9 million roubles and three female noises from them.
This is reported by Interfax with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two of the unknown entered a house on Gorkia Street through an open front door, tied the 20-year-old son of the owner of the house and, threatening both of them with a knife, abducted 9 million roubles and three noises.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage was 9,265,000 roubles, and criminal proceedings were initiated under the heading "Divorce."
European fans risk being homeless.
Only 23 Peterburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will be visiting the World Cup in 2018.
The remaining hotels are not yet in a hurry to obtain a permit.
In the opinion of the experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to world ownership, the authorities will have to come up with an urgent idea of how to settle all the guests of the city.
Rosbalta's interviewees believe that the cost of rental of demountable apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the residences, they will have to pay over.
The World Cup on Football has brought to the attention of the authorities the state of the Russian hotels.
According to a law written specifically under the title, each hotel in Peterburg must be classified and proved to be in line with the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is now clear that not all of them will be able to do so: hotels are so afraid of being checked that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for Petersburg.
According to the head of UFAS, Vadim Vladimirov, the agency has examined 138 hotels and is now planning to start 34 cases against hotels, many of which have simply not responded to the competition.
There are indications that the leadership of three dozen companies has been deceiving the city by placing a number of stars in the commercial, and that Vladimir has noted.
The problem is that now there is literally every number, no one can be lost before 2018.
The men suspect that during the football championship, the fans will take over all the Petroburg hotels.
The number of tourists in the city is now 300,000.
According to the data of Smoly, 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100-two-and-three-star hotels and 550 single-star hotels in Petersburg.
According to the First Deputy Committee for Tourism Development, Nana Guicia, only 23 hotels have so far been classified, so many of the companies accredited in Petersburg have done so.
Whether any hotel has ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, the circumstances are not known.
I mean, it could be more classified, but no one knows about it.
"The last six months, hotels have not very much sought to be classified," recognized by the Director of the North-West Division of the Russian Union of Turin, Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season during which hotels make the most money and do not want to do other business.
Another reason is the budgets in which no verification costs have been budgeted, and the procedure can be cost to the hotel depending on the status of between 30 and 100,000 roubles or more.
However, in recent times, hotel leaders have intensified and started to apply for classification, and have assured Shadskaya.
The hotels have to make it before July 1, 2016, or they will not only pay the fine, but they will not be allowed to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed hotel room fee will be developed for the time of the tournament.
The cost-based formulas will be made public next year.
This is to prevent a 200-300 per cent take-off, as is the case, for example, during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience and not allow a promotion of two or three times, but the hotels have to make a living.
"I think it's going to be up to 50%," explained by the President of the Russian hotel association Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimir, for his part, is not sure that price fixing is consistent with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how this is within the scope of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better than an impeccable cost," he said.
It's not clear what's gonna happen to the popular cheap hostels.
The deputies of the State Duma have introduced a bill that requires that hostels be prohibited in homes.
We very much hope that the law will not be adopted or will not apply to Peterburg.
"We will defend the view that the hostels must be preserved," Nana Gwasiya believes.
However, she said that the owners of mini-hotels should in any case be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma did approve the bill, there would be approximately 80 per cent of the hostels in Petersburg, and there were currently 1,500 rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of North-West Restaurants and Hotels, Leonid Garbar, there are two and three-star hotels in Petersburg that are in need of football fans, but there is an overrun towards hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is similar to that of "75,000 vips in the 80-thousand stadium."
This can be corrected at the expense of the mini-hotels.
Their possible ban is "idiotic": "I think it's strange that some people can live in apartments, but some people can't come."
If the hostel is used as a dorm, I agree it's wrong.
But if as a hotel where the guests come for a short time, why not?
Mini-hotels are at risk of missing the World Cup for football and their integrity.
Hundreds of small hotels are just not going to make it through the classification, and the pit is being spiked on its own.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be required.
"The companies that can do this procedure are not so many, so they will give up less paid orders from mini-hotels, but will choose those that are more expensive," noted Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the checks that have been carried out are now much higher than those of Petroburg.
The reason for the peterburg delay is also due to the constant change in the Government & apos; s tourism block, which does not contribute to a coherent work.
In the view of the experts, if there are not enough Petroburg hotels for all, it is likely that attention will have to be paid to the regional hotels and the rest houses.
In the case of the 300-year anniversary of Peterburg, it is possible to mobilize a river fleet into the city, so that the guests of the tournament will be able to live in a cabin.
In addition, many of the fans are ready to come to the vans where they can sleep.
"The important thing is not to set up so many hotels to empty them," I'm sure Gennady Lamshin.
It will also be very popular during the football period with demountable housing.
It is likely that a stock of residences will be created in the city.
Rent rates will increase by 10-30%.
"Of the obvious, the first to leave a place near the stadium," he noted the rental of the Agency for Development and Research in the Real Estate of Laris Bragin.
The rent price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in the dormitory areas.
The construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city would also help, she stressed.
We should not forget the human qualities of the people of the city.
For example, Leonid Garbar is convinced that Peterburg has always been a welcome city where people not just tell the way, but can also take a mini-tour.
There are complications.
My dad met a family from Murmanska in 1970, a father, a mother and two children.
They had no place to sleep: hotels were difficult at the time, it was hard to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our community apartment to sleep," he remembered.
It was true that there was no such thing in the city at the moment - that it could have consequences and was scary to call home.
But maybe in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hotels and governments will have to be remembered.
Girinovsky "leaked" the Amur region.
I was looking at the Girinovsky clone in the State Duma with admiration today.
He did these things when our generation was just learning how to trade newspapers, and he's still in good shape.
The topic of the statement is, in the view, "LDDP's protest against the results of the elections in the Amur region."
The protocols do not shake - because there is nothing; except for those signed by the beatings - LDPR does not seem to have one.
When he raises Ivan Abramov in second place, he says, "This is the winner of the election!"
And then, after a fight with the president, he takes a faction out of the conference room, literally, "You're all with the front of your crooks and thieves."
The press, of course, is not focusing on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarcation of the faction as a result of this scandal and insult.
In fact, Wolfovic is a beautiful and elegant man who has sold the Amur region along with Abraham.
For the whole country, this is another one of Girinovsky's "Pronka!" rather than a political party's protest against the results of specific elections.
And the faction has formally scandalized, and the election, according to the party's website and Facebook Ivan Abramova, is not recognized, but the leader on the subject is clearly out of control.
He gives the dead on Amur to bury their dead, but he himself is well aware of the "One Russia" in general and of nothing guilty of the spring.
It's a hard decision not to lose a face, and a real, not a, scandal not to go.
Another thing is that now Abraham is in a strange situation.
He didn't wait for anything but the noises from his superiors, and there were no reports of the alternatives on his hands.
He is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but, on the other hand, for a narrow circle, he has become a formal cause and an insult to a respected champion, and, more so, to the Haman attacks on the ER and the FONF.
And then, of course, he needs to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, the region's policy number two and candidate number one for the only regional single-mandate district, it can become a pariah that has successfully benefited from its own party leadership and super-irritant for the very FSF and the party leadership of the alien.
Of course, there would be no Girinovsky, but he should have been made up and respected.
Trump's still growing and growing to him.
There was news that LDDP would be back in the room during the next plenary.
I mean, the bath fell out of nothing.
The only thing about Abraham is a cellar.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai-lama - RT News
Europe could not accept all refugees, said that the Dalai-Lam, adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis lay in the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in the countries of origin.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama compassion centre in Oxford on ethics studies, at the beginning of its 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be higher than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while it was admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It is not possible for everyone to come to Europe," he noted in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria for their response to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"The care of thousands of refugees is excellent, but at the same time you must also think about durable solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries," he stressed.
After all, we must think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force had never solved those problems, "he added.
In the area of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush & apos; s actions following the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks, saying that the US & apos; s strong response had launched a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9 / 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that a solution to the problem was possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences, "said the Dalai-lam.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have swallowed a disinfectant for hands over the past four years
Toxicology centres in the United States reported an almost 400 per cent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who had swallowed a high-alcohol-containing disinfectant, as reported by the Georgia State Toxicology Centre, since 2010.
According to Dr. GayLord Lopez, Director of the Georgia State Toxicology Centre, the cases of hand-disinfecting fluids reported to the toxicology centres by children under 12 years of age increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 1,6117 in 2014.
"Children have more contact with these substances, and unfortunately some of them are sent to the emergency room," Lopez CNN said.
He said that some children drink disinfectant fluid on purpose, and some do so to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
The YouTube video shows teenagers drinking disinfectant fluid as a cheap drink.
Adolescents were reported to have mixed the disinfectant liquid with the alcohol-containing mouth-cutting fluid to get a stronger drink.
Young children may attract a pleasant smell of disinfectant liquid.
"The child doesn't think it could hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most pressing (disinfective hand liquids) are those that are aromatic.
There are disinfective hand fluids with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges that are very attractive to children.
The disinfectant hand fluid contains about 45 to 95 per cent of alcohol.
In small children, in particular, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"This is a high-concentration alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, the chief doctor of the toxicology centre at the Kansas University Hospital.
You wouldn't have just left a bottle of whiskey, but people keep these hand-disinfectant devices in sight, and if the kids get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a disinfectant for hands with strawberry aromate of about four sprays in school, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who was legally considered to be in a state of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett medical centre near Atlanta.
Naija was confused and could not walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
The doctors watched her all night in a separate children's clinic to avoid any signs of brain trauma, because the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, told Ritchie.
"It was very scary," said CNN Orria Scott, Naigi's mother.
It could have been quite fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-pirate substances or disinfective napkins, in addition to removing disinfectant hand fluids from the child's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant liquids are linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after they swallowed a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, not an ethyl alcohol that was identified as an existing substance.
In January, three fourth-grade students in northern New York agreed to poison their "bad" teacher by "spreading antibacterial substances in the class," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the disinfectors for her hands, and she's forbidden to keep them in her class.
The police believe that the failed plan was "empty talk," and address discipline to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the NK regional children & apos; s library, the iron owl is sad.
The kids who come for the books are trying to feed her candy.
For several generations, he has been going to this library for 95 years.
The most recent readers in the twentieth century were doing high-profile reading, performing on the poems of Mayakovsky, performing literary victorines and having written with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalin" wrote in 1939, the "friendship between the Hope of the Constantine Major and the friends of the children's library in Barnaul" became more and more strong every day.
The hope of Constantine even sent a child's picture to a distant Barnaul friend once.
And when the Barnalans asked if the hope of Constantine would be opposed to the library giving its name, he wrote that no, he didn't.
The letters have been in the museum for a long time, and the grandkids and great-grandkids of the first readers have to explain to whom this hard profile is decorated by the Barelyffe on the library building.
In the years of the restructuring, people often called, outraged: why is the children & apos; s library not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of some good child writer, without political colouring!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave it as it is.
"Major" is probably the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, like "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby, a yellow brick track.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is the favorite theme of the artist Oli Moskovka.
Ola used to be a law firm manager, came to work at 8: 00, left at 5: 00, and all the other managers were just love for painting.
And then I found an announcement on the Internet, "I need an illustrator for the book."
A little American girl wrote to Cleakou, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mom has cancer."
Ola made an illustration, and he thought life could end at any time, and there would be no miracle in it if you didn't create them yourself.
Now she works in a library, illustrates the children's books of writers all over the world, and writes stories herself.
Traditionally, children are thought to be losing interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But we have children reading, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, as Tatiana Kushvid, the director of the library, says, "The Russian planet."
In recent years, we have even had such a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and she will live - the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is back.
There is a large exhibition window in the library's lobby with an up-to-date photo display.
Once a quarter, there are new pictures of readers who go to the library by the whole family: mother, dad and children.
The library is happy that more and more dads have come with their children.
If the child was read all over Chukovsky at the age of two, he would need more books at the older age.
But now there is a law that prohibits an eight-year-old vunderkind from issuing books from category 12 +.
To get a book like this, a child has to bring their parents with him - they come back, then they come back again, and then, gradually, "Krupky" becomes something like a family club for them.
The library has a treasure, a pre-revolutionary collection of moulin with yats and eers, to take Coralenko to the "Niva" magazine, and the "Murzilka" bearings in 1936.
Because we are not just the concept space of the book temple, we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school, because Tatiana Kouchvid explains.
We can come to each other to read, play, draw.
We made the playground for the little ones - the baby just comes to play, and the hand still goes to the book!
Some of our readers are being taken away by their parents, and they're shutting their legs, they don't want to leave.
Moms with wheelchairs often come, and we're glad they put the library at the top of all the other places they need to come with the little ones.
Tatiana Kushvid says, "Modern children like we once like classic children's literature:
"The publishing case is being developed, and much attention is being paid to the authors, who are the link between generations."
And speaking of little kids, it's important that there's some hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to break up with their heroes.
The Library regularly produces booklets for parents to tell what is going on in modern children's literature, which books are worth paying attention to and why.
The booklets are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
It is prohibited for adults to issue books outside the reading room.
Only children have this magic privilege.
... there's a square hatch in the far room of the library with an ancient wooden staircase in the basement, in the bookstore.
The steps will be raging under your steps, it's a very old time machine.
You're dating your childhood book like an old comrade. Hey, good thing you and I don't change.
Ally is still just as amusing on a road of yellow brick, Tol Ryzhikov's ribbon is stealing magic matches, and Malchish-Kibalchish has never told the damn bourgeois of the War of Secrets that he has such a strong word.
Books like passwords can be found anywhere.
There are real book inaccuracies in the vault, such as a pre-revolutionary collection of moulin with berries and eels.
Or take Corolenko to a famous app to the Niva magazine.
Or a 1936 Murzilka bearings.
Time drew pages, painted them in tea.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are the fragments of our future collection, and I'm all about to retire and do some rare children's books.
But the children are not going to be so lucky: and the paint in the old books is not very bright, and the topics... open the first page, and there is Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now it's like, why did we all write this "Pioneer Truth"?
But it was still interesting to say, "Russian planet" by Galina Ilyasov, the head of the book store.
The Murzilka pages were lost from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna has been a bookkeeper his whole life.
She knows what the colour of the Buratino's hat is, what school year Harry Potter became the captain of the Griffindor team at the Quiddić Championship, what situations Carlson uses a silencer for a motor, and who is the father of Alice Seseneva.
The librarian's work is not paid enough, and all those who can live without these book series find another profession very quickly.
Only the most convinced are left: educators, teachers, members of the book.
You can also find out from a smile - it's considered a professional feature of a child librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation, he was a professional.
I like children's books at all: as a librarian, I like them to be, just and beautiful, on the shelves, and I also love to read them, "said Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical, fairy tale, fantastic.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think it was different when I was a kid.
The books were the most interesting and exciting thing that happened to me.
And since I loved them madly, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone's sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be there, despite the riders.
And I'm happy when our former readers bring children or grandchildren...
A rumor mill: There's no disagreement in the Seltica.
Griffiths denied talking about a disagreement in Seltica after Dale's confession that Hoops is in a bad position, but he's gonna fix it.
Harts will protest against the Scottish Football Association's claim to Nelson, and Warburton is afraid of signing contracts in January that might disrupt the unity of the team.
"Dons" has increased the advantage of "Celtic" to five points.
The penalty Adam Roney in the first time gave Aberdin a little advantage over Hamilton in Pittodry, which allowed Dons to get away from Seltica by five points.
Griffith denied talking about differences.
This has led to rumours of discord in the Seltica, which have been stopped by Griffiths, who have stated that he and his team members are not suffering from any increased criticism in preparation for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling the tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scottish are not in the fight for title - de Bour.
A former Rangers and a former Dutch member, Ronald de Bour, stated that Dutch football fans had lost interest in Seltica because he did not compete for the title with Rangers.
De Bour, currently a representative of the Ayax, said, "In the Netherlands, no longer show the most attractive moments of the Seltica game, why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in the old firm's games, and not just people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian coach swore to make a difference.
The defeat of Malmö and, as a result, the withdrawal from the Champions' League was soon followed by the loss of 10 Aberdeen football players, who now, after five points, are at the top of the table.
However, Dale said, "The Spleen has had bad periods before, and we're going out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very embarrassing, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And so do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need the support of the Seltica, because it makes the players much better.
It's so important to stay together right now.
Warburton's not sure about the January transferees.
Despite the views that appeared just a few weeks ago, suggesting that he had identified some of the objectives of the January transferees, the Rangers' boss, Mark Warburton, was distrust in the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former Bentford attacker said, "The Java transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the season starts for their adaptation, which you saw in our own group in this season.
The team's working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Micha, who's interested in "Seltik," has indicated his career is over.
Swancy's attacker, Micha, who was linked to Seltica during the transfer window, suggested that he could leave football after his contract with the Ledgeys was over.
A 29-year-old player suffered from ankle problems for two years, and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
The Harts are going to stand up to the SFA about Nelson's statements.
The Harts were in the 2: 1 account when Paterson was removed and lost 3: 2, but the red defence card was later cancelled; this is the third red Collum card cancelled in eight months.
Nelson doesn't give up his words, saying, "I did not question ethics, I did not comment on the game."
Griffith swore to avoid Tincastle.
The stubborn player of the Haibernian team received a reprimand after admitting that he was singing a song with insulting words about former Harts player Rudy Scacela.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Rosebern area of Edinburgh prior to the start of Edinburgh Derby on Tinkasle in March 2014.
"It was derby, and it was hot," said the attacker, adding, "I can say with certainty that I was not going back to Tincastle if he didn't play for" Seltic. "
The Tannadis Board is sure of DundeUnited's management.
Simon Donnelly claims that the board of directors of the Dundy United is still sure that the team of managers will make a difference, but agrees that the deterioration of the field should end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We're gonna get the guys out again, "Donnelly said.
McInnes is glad that "unbeautiful" won from Hamilton.
Derek McInness admitted that his team Aberdeen had to fight the Hamilton Assis in a desperate way to win the seventh consecutive victory in the league, which placed them five points above the Seltica, at the top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Roney's first-time penalty.
McInness said, "There's no team here that won anything, a cup, or a league championship, who didn't win a meeting like this."
The level of unemployment among the Scottish is not changing, while it is increasing in the United Kingdom as a whole.
The number of unemployed persons in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed persons in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher than in the United Kingdom of 5.5 per cent, as shown by the figures of the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, and the number of workers is now 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent per quarter, which is higher than the average of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
The Minister for Scotland, David Mandell, commented on the latest figures and noted: "The Government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy."
It has been almost a year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain a member of the United Kingdom.
In those 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the labour market in Scotland, with increased employment and reduced unemployment.
Why am I a witness to an execution in Oklahoma?
Today, in evading legal intervention at a later stage, I will watch a man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I will be sitting on a death row inspection gallery in Oklahoma prison when Richard Glossup is executed with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
For the first time, this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As this day approached, I became afraid.
So why would you do that?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to be present at executions in America, and because they often want more than places, the results of a dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats was reduced from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will be looking at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I'll be sitting with Richard Glossup's closest friends, and he and I have our own relationship after a few months of phone calls and one visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk to him.
The prison administration says I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of tweeting that I was being impartial.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "could have been better formulated," but she still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossup didn't agree with something I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that if he did.
I told him he could cut me off his witness list any time.
But he wants an international journalist there to write about it.
If he died, he believed that transparency would help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I've written down.
I'm not going to go into the details here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossup is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treze make him guilty of aiding and abetting a crime.
But I believe there's a great chance he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death penalty was not enough.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this angle, I'll watch him die.
I can't say I'll be completely objective.
There will be other reporters who can be called upon to do so.
You'll know from me what it's like to watch the man I like die without need.
A man being prosecuted by the police has been persuaded to leave the Canning River
The constable from the town of Canning Vale managed to get a man out of the Canning River and to stay dry.
Pert's resident intended to leave the police, but failed to get stuck in the dirty water on the shallow water a few metres from a police officer trying to "gently persuade him to go ashore."
The Kanning Vale police were called on Tuesday for illegal entry into a foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police saw the suspect, he tried to leave them when he left for Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He was standing in the water and saying," I'm not going out, come on, grab me, "said Chief Sergeant Sandell Castle.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec did not want to wet his uniform, so he used a safer reception - "negotiations with a good police officer."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," said Chief Sergeant Castledine.
That's what the football champion Ben Cazins remembered.
In 2006, Kazins moved to a quest to avoid meeting with a police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to swim over to Suon.
His efforts had been in vain, but had led the local population to invent a "biatlon Ben Kazins."
Peter Moody is accusing the steward of trying to espionage and threatening to leave a horse sport.
Peter Moody accused the steward of Racing Victoria of trying to put a spy in his stable last year and threatened to leave a horse sport immediately.
His target was the steward and the ethics staff of Racing Victoria, who he accused of having launched a campaign against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tatai because of a drug violation on the day of launch, on Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always doing his best in racing, and he was in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of the Lidari test on cobalt, which he could not explain.
He kept his tongue on suspicion of espionage for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like "green grapes."
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been patient for a long time, but sometimes it's so hard on you that you're no longer holding back," Moody said.
They know it's been going on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'm going to sleep tight.
I want to walk with my head high and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start thinking they're not, then I have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Moody sensationally stated in an interview on racing.com that the ethics department had tried to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I would call, if I asked, and offered him a job in my stables to give information about what I was doing in my stables," said Moody on Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all certainly apply, as the attempt to catch me failed.
Robert Rolston, former president of RVL, David Moody, current president of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, the new executive director of RVL, knew all along and now.
Shouldn't it make me think it's personal?
Shouldn't the RVL be brave and held accountable for what's going on in this business, people other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I so bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying can make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and it's sad.
I'm really sad about that.
I will put pressure on them and hold them responsible for their decision-making.
I have family support, and I can leave.
Coach's adversity just grew up during a long investigation into the cobalt and Lidari case, and the last withdrawal of the horse from the start made him say he could "throw his license on the table."
Moody, most well known for having prepared the undefeated champion Black Kaviar, called the requirements for the use of drugs on the day of the "ridiculous" competition after a gland-based compress had been placed on the horse's feet, which was a violation of the rules.
It's a rule-breaking race.
"I must be fully responsible for this," he said.
One of my employees, by mistake, made a press on her leg.
She could have got a press last night.
She could have got it yesterday, just like it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody can be disqualified for three months, according to the rules on the use of drugs on the day of the conpress competition, for which the steward has opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's gone too far," Moody said.
A driver who had been in a hit-and-run at the scene of the Koboum incident was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Koboum on the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken on a helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on the morning of Saturday.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help an injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene of the incident, not providing assistance and violating other traffic regulations.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Qupom, remains in a stable hospital.
"Melbourne Storm" coach Craig Bellamy is in charge of the use of hard power.
The "Melbourne Storm" coach, Craig Bellamy, called the "agenda-setting" criticism of his team's intercept of the ball as a "agenda-setting" by two of the NRL championships.
The coach, Sidney Rosters, Trent Robinson, stated that the judges had allowed Storm to fight his team during the sudden victory of Storm at the end of the Sydney qualification game on Friday night.
The coach, "Bribery Broncos," Wayne Bennet, made a clear call to "Storm" after his team won the final of the "Nozern Queensland Cowboys" qualification tournament on the night of Saturday, when he called this game "typical" for the rugby league and stated that two of the Queensland team were not "too successful" in a hand-to-hand fight.
Bellamy was protecting his team's capture of the ball and said they were just focusing on "contact" by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was given confidence in the criticism of his team by the two leading coaches, as it meant that they were concerned about the possible defeat of Storm.
"It's still coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about the hard-on when they beat us with a 24: 2 count," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can vouch that we haven't changed anything for a year in our security systems or techniques, just over the past six weeks, we have given special attention to the contacts when we intercept the ball, and that is a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and he's clearly been training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football," reminding his teacher that "St. George-Illawarra Dragons" Bennett won the 2010 championship by showing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about an exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was, "Bellamy noticed.
I remember that in the 2010's, St. George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care about it at all.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is an impressive football, especially his young half-defenders, at their speed.
It's a football you'd like to play when you have players like that.
He made this comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two half-advocates, such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things, because they're a little worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game "Storma" and "Rusters" was a match with more points than the game "Broncos" and "Kaubois."
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game, he was 20: 18, there were two more attempts - and what, that's an impressive football?
Or is it an impressive break and a failed attempt?
It's a routine for me.
If they're talking about us, it means we can meet them there at some point.
The Storm is on a weekend at the end of this week, as they won the right to take over either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronalla Sharks next Saturday night at the preliminary end of the AAMI Park Stadium, the tickets will be made available next Tuesday morning.
The accused in possession of drugs was released on bail of $200,000.
A man who is facing life imprisonment for trying to take 40 kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released on bail of $200,000.
Marco Maximovich, 29, is one of the five people arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kilograms of drugs on a Solay boat from South America through Vanuatu, which was taken to Kumer in August.
During the morning, Maximović and his accomplices were seen at the marina, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse Café, where the police found 40 kg of the drug in Toyota Echo's car.
Although Maximović is at risk of life for trying to assign drugs in sufficient quantities for sale, Maximović & apos; s lawyer claims that there is no evidence that the latter was trying to obtain the entire shipment and that the man could have been in a café without any intent.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximović should have been released on bail.
The latter had links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
The mother and stepfather of Maximović were offered a joint bail of $200,000 for his release.
"It is clear from the testimony of both that the amount of bail is too much for them," noted by Judge Flanagan.
But this measure alone is not sufficient as a guarantee that he will not disappear, but a judge has added.
Maximović was allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he would issue both his Australian and Serbian passport, report to the police on a daily basis and observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m..
"I'm proud of Greece's team, which fought for the last few seconds."
The lead coach of the Greek team, Fox Cazikaris, paid tribute to his team after the 1 / 4 final of the Eurobasketball 2015 with Spain (71: 73).
According to him, the fate of the game was determined by some mistakes.
It was a big game, quote the AFP Cacicaris.
We were preparing for a great game of Spanish performance.
We tried to work for the defense, but the defense mistakes determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I will be assigned the functions of Cawn at the CICA."
The new CICA, Joel Freeland, said he didn't believe in the curse of the army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win Euroleague in the next season.
I've been talking to Coach Dimitris Ithudis a few times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, I quote "R-Sport" Freeland.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to reconfigure to the centric position, but I was more of a forward at the NBA.
Now we're gonna have to fight the big centric rival more, but I've done it before, so I think I can do it now.
The army won Euroleague for the last time in 2008.
Since then, they have made six visits to the Finals of Four, but they have never been able to show their best basketball.
There's a feeling that the team has been reclining.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's hard, I understand all the frustration of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, we have a good chance to win Euroleague, I really think so.
I've always wanted to win this title, and the Moskwici have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CICA.
As for the eye, I'm not a superstitious man and I don't believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you bring these two things together, everything is possible.
I don't have any specific rituals in front of the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Louis Enrique: "For me, the" Roma "match will be special."
The main coach of the Barcelona League, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the first round of the World Champions League group tournament with "Roma," with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the face-to-face of his current and former team will be far from being a regular one.
We will recall that Luis Enrique trained "wolves" in the 2011-12 season, but failed to show himself at the best in Italy's capital.
I return to Rome a few years later, for which I have gained some experience.
I have very warm memories of Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start at the Champions League from the victory.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the near match.
I expect the "Roma" game she showed in series A against "Juventus."
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: "Krasnodar" has various options for attacking. "
The Chief Coach, "Urala," Vadim Skripchenko, in the run-up to the 9th round of the Prime League with the "Krasnodar," noted the diversity of the attack schemes of the rival team.
According to the mentor, the "bulls" have several models in their arsenal to play the attack.
The fight will take place on 21 September and will begin at 4.30 p.m. Moscow time.
As we play with the Krasnodar, let's see, the official site of the Urala is the words of the Cricpchenko.
We have a whole week of training ahead of us.
This team has different options for attacking, many attacks, but we're not slow, so I think it's gonna be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that Krasnodar is playing a game of the League of Europe against Dortmund Borussia, we will try to prepare very well to win.
Roker Kanyas: "Astana's house" can take the glasses from anyone. "
After the first round of the group tournament of the League of Champions with the "Benfika" (0: 2), Astana's half-champion, Roker Kanyas, expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
In the view of Hawbeck, the Astaninans are able to take their glasses from any rival in their field.
Even though it was a hard match for us, I can say that we played well, the official UEFA website Kanyas said.
Benfika is a higher class, but in a home game, I think we can count on taking their glasses.
It's quite real.
But first you have to think about Galatasarai and then you have to think about Atlantico.
In home games, we can take the glasses from anyone.
Rafael Benítez: "I will repeat as many times as I can: Krishtiana Ronaldo is the best in the world."
The main coach, Rafael Benítez, expressed satisfaction with the major victory in the first round of the Champions League group tournament with the Shahter (4: 0).
The specialist paid tribute to the forward-born Christian Ronald, who had been the author of three heads.
The match was difficult because the Shahter can own the ball, which is the official UEFA website of Benitez's words.
The rival did not have many moments, but their contraventions are always dangerous.
I can't tell you that Real was perfect, but we had a good chance to do it.
I'm glad we didn't miss the balls and hit four.
Krishtiana Ronaldo has confirmed his level.
It's the best player in the world, I'll do it all the time.
Jordi Alba: "Cristiana Ronaldo can't be compared to Messi."
The Barcelona Advocate, Jordi Alba, believes that no one can compare with his one-strawberries, Lionel Messi.
According to the Spanish, the "Reala" forward is not able to do that, either.
The five-head Messiah is above the others, citing Le Figaro Alba.
Even Krishtiana Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field, things are changing, I can't compare them to anyone.
Danielle De Rossi: "Barcelona" has not only a unique style, but also a bright identity.
The "Roma" semiconductor Daniele de Rossi, on the eve of the "Barcelona" group tournament, noted the importance of compact and insurance in playing with such a strong rival.
The meeting will be held tomorrow, starting at 21.45 Moscow time.
Let's remind you, "C" will do her text broadcast.
Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players, citing the official UEFA De Rossi website.
It is difficult to play with a blue grenade, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright individuals.
To keep them, we're gonna have to go all the way through the game, and we're gonna have to keep each other safe.
Messiah is almost always successful when he's in the field, so we need to keep the compactness and the organization.
Jev hopes to be on the start-up team of the SSA in a match with the "dictionary."
Holkiper SKA Ilya Yjov stressed that he hoped to be a start-up member of the army in the next KHL Championship.
Jev went on ice instead of Mikko Koskinen for 23 minutes at 0: 3, and reflected all the rotations on his gate, and the fourth goal of UKA was missed after he replaced the enemy with a sixth field player.
The next game, the team will be on the way against Slovan.
I hope I can go out in the next start-up match, "" R-Sport "is what Yozov said.
I'm not an expert on the enemy, I'm an enemy, we don't have a rerun of the missing heads, so it's hard to track.
"Dinamo" was good, everyone has bad games.
The team still lost.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.
Shafarjova was admitted to a hospital with a virus infection.
Lucy Shafarjova is hospitalized with a bacterial infection, reports to AFP.
The Czech tennis player is currently in a clinic in Brno.
The timing of the recovery of the Roland Garros-2015 finalist is not yet known.
It will also be recalled that on Monday, Shafarjova went up one line in the WTA rating and is now the fifth rocket in the world.
Stivan Hogg used the girl's phone to get paedophiles to send photos.
The pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for images of child abuse.
Stivan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep and registered with the Internet message service, where she received a number of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found a missing phone, and found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photos, and then immediately brought it to her mother's attention.
The police came and saw five images, then examined the computers found at the address and found "appropriate" search engine requests using words to detect indecent images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done it, because it could "involve the paedophiles," and then he would "pretend he was a police officer to scare them."
Commissioner Eilid Robertson told the sheriff's court in Dundy, "He said it was a habit, he was afraid of people.
He admitted that he was making requests on the computer, but he said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare the paedophiles.
He was questioned about a conversation with an unknown man who sent him images and that he had asked for more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the photos on her phone, she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw the indecent images on the phone, and the accused was put on a face-to-face.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used the computer and the PlayStation to speak to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23 years old, from Ward Road to Dundy, pleaded guilty to the charges of making indecent photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating bail on 25 January this year and not being tried at a hearing on 24 March this year.
The defendant's counsel, Gregor Sim, applied not to include Hogg on the list of perpetrators of sexual offences, as it can be proved that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has suspended his sentence until October, pending receipt of certificates from the social services.
Hogg was released on bail in the case, but he was taken into custody prior to the hearing of other remaining cases.
He was added to the list of persons who had committed sexual offences before the date of the sentence.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, is reading the wrong speech in Parliament.
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest State leader of Africa, fell earlier this year from the stage.
He was not injured, but the video with the scene of the fall just spread on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also overshadowed by statements by parliamentary opposition that they had received anonymous threats to prevent them from desecrating Mugabe during the treatment.
A month ago, they called on the President during his address to the nation in Parliament; that is what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
A member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, Innocent Gonese, stated that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to interrupt the Mugabe speech.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but is entitled" Death, "he told the journalists at the end of the Mugabe speech.
It had warned the members of Parliament who had been mentioned that immunity would end in the building of Parliament, and once they were out, parliamentary integrity did not work.
A member of Parliament stated that a party led by Morgan Zwangirai was "concerned" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is planning to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs under its restructuring and service delivery programme.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the more rapidly developing hardware and service sectors.
The estimates resulting from the proposed job reduction would be approximately $2.7 billion, beginning in the fourth quarter, as stated in the Hewlett-Packard statement.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, the chairman and general director of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett-Packard is currently, and the portfolio of business will be wider and deeper to help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of over $50 billion and "will focus on providing previously unattainable integrated technology solutions" to companies, as reported in the company's application.
This is the case with a company formed in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett, and Dave Packard, for the release of electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was called "the birthplace of the Kremlin Valley."
Hewlett Packard is in a process of major restructuring to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This step by HP, the world's second personal computer producer and one of the largest technical companies in the United States, is a recent development in this sector, based on the confidence that highly specialized companies are working better.
The Arsenal Captain, Michael Arta, says his classmates must support the injured Jack Wilshire in front of the game with Dinamo Zagreb.
In a conversation with Wilshire Winger, he also stressed that it was only September and that, provided that Wilshire's recovery was as planned, there would be nothing to prevent him from going back to the game for Christmas.
With the most favourable developments, Wilshire will definitely miss at least four of the next games in England and, given this, his participation in the European championship next summer remains in question.
The most important part of this recent problem is that Wilshire was confident that he had completed the previous season with the only ankle injury and was going back to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury is not a threat to his career."
It's just not a fully healed bone.
It's nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It's not about the ankles or the injuries he's had before.
These may be medically related things, but as Wenger also suggested, there is a associated risk of further injury for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an adverse trend.
According to the Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has 23 different injuries that have occurred to him in the six years since his debut.
He also played only 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the League in the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenal's scale, you can see that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two clubs of the Prime League that had the most lost days due to injuries.
Winger recognizes the possibility of a shot in a vicious circle, but the Arsenal believes that the improvement of injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you get back into service after an injury, you're vulnerable for some time," in which time you need to reclaim your strength and gain a competitive advantage, "said Winger.
Jack's young enough to do it.
I hope that he will recover physically, and I am sure that his career will be what he deserves.
The Arsenal is launching a campaign at the Champions League on Wednesday with Dinamo-Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspoor, and Wenger intends to rotate.
Héctor Belerin and Aaron Ramzi did not come to Croatia, so it is likely that Mathieu Debushi and Artea will play as a start-up.
It is possible that Winger will also be a member of Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giru, instead of Nacho Morel and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep a balance and give a little break to those players who need it," Wenger told me.
Although "Arsenal" is an unconditional favorite in Group F, the "Maximir" stadium in Zagreb is among the most disheartening in Europe.
"Dinamo" has not lost any of the 41 games since they were able to spend the last season as "The Undefeated."
On Tuesday night, the stadium was hit by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was 10 in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that the Arsenal learned the lesson from the last season, when the team was defeated in the Monegasque Champions League, and remains with a weak hope to lead the club to a victory in the final of the Champions Cup.
"It's an incredible drive," Winger noticed.
The Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm a realist with old age.
We have ambition, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons in male friendship.
The absence of such stories has become apparent, especially given the degree to which men & apos; s need for candour has become desperate, now more than ever, while the rate of suicide among young men is at the highest level in 15 years.
In 2013, this was the only major cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely to be killed than women.
In an effort to address the issue of "Campaign against Mislife," the year 2015 was declared the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient has a large number of "normal" friends, the chances of treatment are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the chance of mental disorders.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all, it needs to be.
In an era where communication is managed by social networks, where style prefers content, the speed of response is often more valuable than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, fun and successful, even if, in reality, there is loneliness.
This superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status - entirely at the expense of domestic values, our internal desire for personal growth and friendship, which have a greater impact on our mental health.
And, as a billionaire recently noticed, a video game maker, you can't actually buy more happiness for money.
The trust of Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each of the characters was not defined through their work, but rather through an individual who showed up with his friends.
The humor of Joey and the constant embrace of Chandler, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's asphyxiation on Rachel, are all based on the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully studying their feelings.
As Samaritas said to me, "my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal, highlights how even the smallest communication of friends can be of benefit."
Often, men who turn to us feel unable to speak to friends.
The old "live with this" education is strong, as is the feeling that a frank discussion of problems can be perceived as a weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to propose longer-term mechanisms to overcome.
It highlighted the inconspicuous moments of male friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of foreign people speaking on the phone helps people in times of despair, while long-term support comes from a family and friends.
So, if you go to FriedsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where for the holiday, you've completely restored the decorations, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink.
Or even better, if you see a single man at Starbucks, smile and say, "Hey."
I don't know what good friendship can do in advance.
The "Friends" series shows Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 series, by tag # "FriedsFest"
Di Maria is taking a goal to help the PJ destroy the Malmö.
Angel de Maria, on an equal basis with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Kavani, celebrates the bred balls at the Malmö gate.
Angel de Maria, who debuted at the Champion League, scored a goal, which allowed the "PCJ" to easily bypass "Malmö" on Tuesday.
Here's the game report and the response to the game.
Angel de Maria and Edinson Kavani did their job when Pari Saint-Germain started his game at the Champion League with a very convenient victory of 2: 0 against Malmö at Park de Prince on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first game at the League of Champions began as a "PSW" player to give direction to the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their advantage when Cavaney scored a goal of 61 minutes.
In addition to Real Madrid and the Canadian Shahter in Group A, Pari had to make a good start in the game against Sweden's champions, as they were not aimed at the qualification of playoffs, but at the continuation of the series of successful games of the last three seasons where they had reached the quarterfinals.
They made glasses, but at the same time, it was not the best decision on Laurent Blan to find Zlatan Ibrahimović useless in the attack and to replace him in a field against a team from his hometown and a club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win houses or guests at the Champion League, so to win with 2: 0, to give the rivals problems, and to play well in protection is a good start, even if there are other things that we need to work on during the season," said Blanc.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, even though I wish we had one or two more balls.
Ibrahim returned after an injury in one of the parisian replacements, which brought her a 2: 2 match with Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but was put on the back by Di Maria at the fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker was pointed out as a player able to bring the PSW to a new level in Europe after being bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he ran off from Marco Verratti behind Malmö's protection, he completed the attack by sending the ball past Johan Willand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone was expecting an easy and great victory from PSW then, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who defeated Seltik in the playoff to get to this stage, had a major opponent with nine world-level players on the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two team members in the middle of the field.
But, with the exception of a hit by Nikola Jurgic, when the ball flew past the long-standing position of the Kevin Trapp gate for 34 minutes, they attacked very little.
At the same time, PSW has at times failed to deliver its own results and weak attacks, particularly from Ibrahimović, who was not able to make at least five attempts in the first half of the world, and then failed to process the ball that was hit by Kavani immediately after the game resumed.
However, he had shown himself to be much more able in the right passages, and it was a pass from Ibrahimović, who had received, Di Maria sent a ball with a shook that went to the back of the train by Wiland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after a clockwork, thanks to Kavani, a Uruguayan hit his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimović had adjusted the ball sent to the centre of the field with the left flank of Maxwell.
This has put an end to any ideas that Malmö had to go back to the game, and only to intercept Wiland's ball from a close distance prevented David Louis from increasing the final account before the replacement Esejel Lavessi counted the goal at the end of the game.
The "Malme" coach Age Hareida later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions took place last December."
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Purity of the "Pari"!
It was a wonderful match with them.
Glencore makes $2.5 billion in stock sales.

The White House confirms Si Jinpin's visit to Washington.
On Tuesday, the White House confirmed in an official report that China's head Xi Jinping would be arriving on an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit, the first visit of Si Qinpin to Washington, will take place on 25 September and will be a follow-up visit to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The President and First Lady of the United States, Michel Obama, will also receive Si Jingpin with Pen Ljuan's wife at a government lunch the same day after two leaders have bilateral talks.

It is expected that Si Jinpin, whose visit was first announced in February, will stop in Seattle to meet with the leaders of several leading American technology companies on his way to Washington and then go to New York to participate in the September UN General Assembly.
It is expected that Obama and Si Jing will discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyberespionage and China's growing categorical nature with regard to the disputed area of the South China Sea.
The biker who hit Kutuzov was given two years of colony.
In addition, the Court partially granted the victims & apos; civil claims against Denis Mirzoev in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
The European Court of Moscow sentenced Denis Mirzoev, who killed a motorcyclist in Kutuzov Prospect in Moscow.

In addition, the court partially granted the victims & apos; civil claims of 1.2 million roubles.
In the course of the parties & apos; debate, the prosecutor requested that Mirzoev be sentenced to three years & apos; imprisonment and that his claims be brought against the victims in full - eight million roubles.
The accident in question took place on 22 May at around 3 a.m. in the area of 30 Kutuzov Prospect.

The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Federal State.
It is based on the fruitful cooperation of the regions, the important links between the two States.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, are scheduled to participate in the plenary session.
The plenary and section sessions will focus on the experience of the regional and local authorities of the Russian Federation and Belarus in implementing industrial policy, regulations and programmes of the Federal State.
The Governor of the Tumen region will address the forum.
I believe that this is an indication of the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and agencies, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also be present.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will be in operation.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new and beneficial contracts and agreements.
I add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk last June.
It was attended by more than 200 delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At that time, a very important cooperation treaty was signed between the Tumen and Minsk regions.
The importance of our work is also reflected in the fact that a permanent seminar at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tumen.
In addition, a delegation from the Tümensk region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarus in the training of agricultural personnel, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city's administration.
What topics were discussed?
During a meeting with the Governor of the Tümensk region, Vladimir Yakushev referred to the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in today & apos; s difficult circumstances.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be raised: they are needed to reduce the cost of machinery for the end-user.
Problems were discussed in the work of the "Belshin" Toman Trade House and options for preventing loss.
Issues are important, as investment projects should work clearly and bring benefits to the region.
Reference was made to the continued supply of passenger and cargo equipment to the MAS, the development of the MAS service centre, which was established in Tmeni, based on the TPATP.
The discussion also referred to the preparation of a visit by a working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of this year.
Another topic of the discussion was the conclusion of the agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Tumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
The dynamics of the relationship thus promise to reach a new level.
The regional centre was also concerned with these questions.
During our meeting with the head of the city of Tumen, Alexander Moore, we talked about the renewal of the Turkish bus park.
Some 100 buses are already breathing on the palm, so a new shipment of cars from Belarus will be required to operate on gas, clean fuel.
Another aspect is that the Tumen elevator plant is working with one of the leading manufacturers of the Mogilevoleftmash LSA elevator products, receiving components.
In my view, these activities could become more active, given the programmes for the installation of new elevators at the regional centre.
I would add that, within the framework of the expanded mandate of the Consul, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgani region, Alexei Kokorina, during which the issue of increased trade and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zoral was discussed.
A meeting with the Om Governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district is composed of five constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but the prison can be described as a state of the district.
The region is a ground for many promising projects, including the work of an honorary genconsul.
In general, such meetings are important and good for dealing directly and quickly with many problems, eliminating them and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current context, it is essential not to destroy the gap while continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon is against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people working in film production.
Matt Damon argued with an African-American producer, Effie Brown, claiming behind the scenes that it was not necessary to take ethnic composition into account.
During the Sunday issue of Project Greenlight on HBO, a famous actor overcame Brown when she tried to highlight the need for alternative views on the main black character in the selected scenario.
"Diversity is appropriate when you're casting for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
Brown, who was disgruntled, did not believe his ears, said, "Wow!
In order to discuss the finalists of the show, the co-producers Ben Afflek and the Farrelli brothers joined Damon and Brown.
"I would like the participants - no matter who will be the director - to think about what the Harmoni images are going to be," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white pimp.
The producer of the film "Dark White People" was in favour of Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancacho being the director of the film; Damon was very opposed, saying, "In the end, we can get what we want."
After this discussion was shown on television, social media blew up disapproval of Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni made an infuriating comment on the video: "The explanation of diversity from Matt Damon is the only black person in the room of TACOE BELE, which is painful."
The tweet has reached over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "likas."
Damon's statements come out just when the media's literacy on the subject of race is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public debate.
After a young man named Michael Brown was shot by a police officer in 2014, Black Lives Matter became popular throughout the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colour population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement at the time of the presentation of the candidates for the "The Year's Album" at the Grammy Awards.
"The Albums still matter," he said.
As books and lives of blacks, albums still matter.
Most recently, Black Lives Matter's leaders issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News, Elizabeth Hasselbek, about whether the group would be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter is a love group," said the leaders of the movement.
It has recently been announced that Damon is on the list of show business, producers and media magnets invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation or met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards the first champion.
The professional scallosis and assistant waitress Isaac Caldiero on Monday night was the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show to take home a $1 million prize.
This sports show, the seventh season of which has just ended, has not yet allowed any of the participants to go through all the stages of the road with obstacles.
In the end of the season, two participants, Caldiero and an operator, Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included a 75-foot rope up in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to do the job and was the first athlete in the history of "American Ninja Warrior," which was the most exhausting phase of 4, but Caldiero did the task three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After a win that was hard-won, Caldiero, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview to "E! News."
"Thinking about it is incredible, I've never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac commented to E journalists!
And all of a sudden... I never even knew how it was... the future was unknown.
Executive producer Kent Wood met with the journalists "The Hollywood Reporter" to talk about the final and why Britten, who was the first to pass the track, would not receive any money.
According to the rules, the money is received by the fastest bidder.
"If the finishing players are more than one, the prize is the fastest of them," Wid said.
Although money is a great reward and a change in life, it still gets a great deal of satisfaction.
I don't think he's feeling any bad about it.
He's happy with what he did.
He got tons of enthusiastic fan feedback.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was gonna lose someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we changed roles.
The "America Ninja Warrior" show will be back with the eighth season, which will be released in the spring of 2016.
"Detroit Tigers" is quiet about "Minnesota Twins."
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season was not particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers is now the last in the central division of the American League.
By claiming only to be a hindrance, Tigers won a great deal on Tuesday at Minnesota Twins, with a total of 5-4 on the Target-Field.
Twins missed a chance to reduce half-game backlogs from Houston Astros and take second place in the playoffs by the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroit, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which eluded most of the second half of the season.
"All the wins are fun, no matter how they are made," reported by the manager of the Tygers, Brad Osmus.
The Tigers' Pitcher, Alfredo Simon, made a contribution to support the attacks, resulting in Detroit gaining three points in the first two innings, then adding one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a 6-1-3 inning pitcher and missed three wounds.
It was only his third high-quality start in nine exits.
"I just want to end a year with good performance," said Simon.
Pitchers can't be left to replace each game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
Victor Martinez, who was appointed to fight the Tigers, was able to take three strikes and achieved two wounds, the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day of three strikes since the four attacks against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He did a good job with the bat," said Osmus.
He was good at being a batter, much better at being a bat, and he kept that quality for a game.
After taking three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got its best chance to go back to the game.
The central host, Byron Baxton, opened the inning dabble on the left line of the field.
Reitfield Aaron Hicks took the first base, and the second baseball player, Brian Dosier, received a strike-out from Simon before his place was taken by the left-hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy went around Moer, the only player on the way before the newly appointed one, Miguel Sano, who beat a two-track single to the left of the right-hand Drew Verhagen.
In a couple of rangers not at the end and a comparable wound at the second base of VerHagen, the third Basman, Trevor Pluff, was able to be beaten into a double-play.
It was the 27th time for a top league player in this season, when Pluff hit the ball on a double-play.
After Detroit added a backup wound in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer made a RBI "dable" in the space between the autfields against the Tigers' closing pitcher, Bruce Rondon, and the account was 5-4.
However, the right-hand player beat Sano after three strikes and got his fifth safe.
Detroit took advantage of a temporarily unpracticed Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
The Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the list of the injured until the game, without more than a month due to the inflammation of the lumbar.
"Definitely not the start I want," said Hughes, "but as the game developed, I felt more comfortable and so I was able to do some pretty good shots in the third inning."
After the first batter reached base one, Hughes left the single with Ian Kinsler's second baseball.
The lesson at the two outposts of Raitfield J. D. Martinez led Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle of the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez completed his "0 for 21" series with the wounded in a successful position.
The third base player, Nick Castellanos, then made a single with another wound, but Victor Martinez was beaten in an attempt to get close to the third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
Tigers increased the second inning account by receiving a single-aute "dough" from James McCann's catcher and a two-handedly "single" from Anthony Goose, and it turned out to be 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said the manager of "Twins" Paul Molator.
He didn't hit much, but he got right at the right point.
Hughes, who was considered to have been cast, was thrown in a third-time inning, after which he was replaced by a right-hand release by A. J. Ahter.
Hughes got three wounds on six hits and a four-track-out duck.
NOTES: The Tighers' Pitcher right-hand, Anibal Sánchez, is out of the game because of the right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who was doing a shoulder surgery on Sánchez as early as 2007.
Sánchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sánchez, pitcher left, Daniel Norris will leave the list of the injured and go out against Twins.
Norris, who left the Tigers at four starting points since his acquisition in exchange for David Price's left-hand pitcher on July 30, has one victory and one defeat.
He has not been in the game since August 20 because of the spiking of the muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will complete a series of three games on the Targetfield on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43), the pitcher-right man Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73) will play.
The original complaint by Kadyrov on the book "Pray to God" was brought before the South Sahalin Court.
The South Sahalin City Court received the original appeal from President Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov against the decision to recognize "extremist material" of the book "Molba to God: its meaning and place in Islam," reports "Interfax" with reference to the President of the Court, Alexander Chuhry.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties to the proceedings.
Chuhhai refused to comment on the statements made by some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation on the need to check the court's cooperation with foreign special services and ISIL.
"Let them comment on such stupid things," he said.
On 11 September, the South Sahalin City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognize the book as "extremist material."
An appeal was received from the South Sahalinsk Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office considers that they have asked the court to be extremist only to the author & apos; s opinion and not to the Koran.
In the opinion of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the judge made the wrong decision, "he said.
The decision to recognize the book as "extremist material" was adopted on 12 August 2015.
In particular, the Qur'an was said to be "extremist": "We worship you and call upon you for help," so do not call on anyone other than Allah. "
Kadyrov called the decision-makers "devils and provocators."
He called on the deputies of the State Duma to prohibit by law judicial decisions relating to the texts of the Holy Books.
"I firmly believe that the State Duma must adopt a law that prohibits judicial decisions relating directly to the text of the Koran and other Divine Books," Kadyrov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments insulting migrants and refugees
Facebook staff intend to remove posts and comments that give negative assessments to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
The leadership of Facebook is committed to combating xenophobia and racism on the network, together with the German Ministry of Justice.
For example, on the day before, the head of the department of Haiko Maas stated that the minuteur was currently working with social media professionals to establish a special group of simulators.
Participants are required to monitor and remove irregular comments on migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of non-tolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for the removal of their records.
Organizations with expertise in the collection of complaints of offensive posts from users of social media should also facilitate the rapid freezing of illegal content.
Facebook management intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts of negative speech against migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was taken after the German segment of Facebook had seen a sharp increase in xenophobic attitudes.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis that affected the European Union some time ago.
In Germany, for example, all refugee accommodation facilities are already overcrowded.
On the eve, the authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants on the territory of the former Buhenwald camp.
Forced displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
In Moscow cemeteries, there will be areas for relaxation.
In the near future, several metropolitan cemeteries are being equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
The first will be the Butovsky, the Domodovsky and the Scherbin Cemetery.
The first area for psychological rest has already appeared in the Troekurov cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, such sites will be found in other parts of the city.
This portal was told by Artem Ekimov, who is the head of the State budget institution "Ritual."
The relaxation zones will be small green areas that resemble parks.
In such "corners," the experts considered that visitors to cemeteries would be able to rest, be alone with themselves and restore psychological forces.
In the near future, the rehabilitation zones will be built in Domododov, Butovsky and Scherbin cemeteries and then in other parts of the capital.
According to the head of the Ritual, if there is a need to expand the area of the cemetery, the builders will try to maintain the existing forest areas to the maximum extent possible.
Green plantations will be a living fence that will separate the rest areas and the area allocated directly to the burial sites.
The Ritual experts also indicated their intention to propose no fences at the graves.
New cemeteries can indeed become barrier-free.
In addition, Ritual indicated that it was ready to install electronic terminals through which visitors to cemeteries would be able to learn GPS coordinates and burial plates.
In June of this year, Ritual also proposed that the cost of burial services be adjusted according to the time of the year.
So, the digging of the grave in summer time will be worth a thousand roubles cheaper, a week in winter, when the earth is frozen.
We note that, over the past year, the cost of all ritual services has increased by an average of 10 per cent.
In the Yelnian forests, five days later, they found a lost fungal.
The older man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without a supply.
The joint efforts of rescue workers and volunteers have made it possible to find the fungal gorge.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old retired from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
No food and no water.
The family, the rescue workers, the volunteers were looking for him.
There was even a dog movie, but there was no result.
The man was found after a helicopter was involved in the search.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the forest to get his wrists and ladders, but did not return by the evening.
The family immediately sought assistance, and the following day, rescue workers and displeased residents from a neighbouring village, some 30 people, were raised to search for a fungal.
A fire and rescue centre helicopter joined them for the fifth day.
Andrei Seletkov, the head of the search and rescue team of the Smolen region fire and rescue centre, said, "The helicopter was engaged, the man was found."
He's gone very far, very different place.
It was about 12 miles from the search site.
He went a long way at his age.
The miracle is still alive.
Grybnikov was taken to the Yale Central District Hospital unconscious, in a very difficult condition.
The medical staff diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and body overcooling.
As an old man has been able to live after five days in the forest, the doctors are completely unrepresented.
Valentin Nepsha, head of the medical department of the Yelnian CRB: "A patient's examination, treatment is assigned."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial therapy.
Given all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, remains heavy but positive.
Retirement of Vitaly Alexandrovich comes to Smolenshina from the Tambov region every year.
His grandson says his grandfather used to go to pick up mushrooms, but he never went deep into the woods.
Alexei Spitchenko, the grandson of the fungal found, shared: "The forest is close to the road, not the local one."
I've been visiting for almost a few years, visiting my family.
So I went to get the mushrooms.
It must have gone a little far and lost.
With the start of the fungal season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolen region.
In the last few days alone, five similar cases.
The saviors remind me that you have to go to the woods with a little bit of food, matches, and compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave traces behind so that they can then return.
The Ac-2 emergency was on a sewer in a brother's secret.
Right on the sewers, he's in Siberia, emergency AN-2.
The aircraft of the Russian airline, Yenisei, made an emergency landing 68 kilometres from Bratsk.
There were no casualties and no casualties, but the aircraft itself suffered significant damage on landing.
A-2 was on a service flight.
It had three crew members on board, a commander, a second pilot and an on-board mechanic, reporting "Interfax."
The aircraft carried out a flight along the route of Železnogorsk-Ilimsk-Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The aircraft's crew has already been taken to Bratsk.
The Brotherhood Transport Prosecutor & apos; s Office, following an emergency landing of AN-2, has begun to verify compliance with the air safety legislation.
The investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor & apos; s Office went to the scene.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew planted its aircraft with passengers due to a technical failure at an abandoned Tai airfield in Komi.
On the liner, engines and on-board electronics were refused, but the crew made the impossible.
The aircraft was carrying 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one was injured in an emergency landing.
The economy - Nobel laureate: globalization
The processes of globalization should have contributed to reducing inequalities in the world.
In fact, the situation was different, and the income gap in the developing economies was on the increase.
Eric Maskin.
In order to remedy this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers, as is the view of the Chief Scientific Officer of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-making of the WSE, the Nobel Prize winner for the Economy of 2007, Eric Maskin.
Over the past 20 years, the world has experienced an unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
The proponents of globalization have predicted great benefits for the developing economies.
"And these projections have come to a large extent," Maskin stresses.
For example, China and India have experienced significant per capita GDP growth.
But not everything is so happy.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between "the haves" and "the poor" in poor countries, which was manifested in large income inequality, more specifically pay.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, and Eric Maskin notes in his article "Why global markets have not reduced inequalities in developing economies," published in The World Bank Economic Review, which has translated and quoted EIT.
Together with an economist, Professor Michael Kremer, Harvard University, Eric Maskin, has developed an alternative theory that shows why the income gap in poor countries is increasing as globalization increases, is similar to EIT.
In the new global market, specific processes are taking place.
To demonstrate them, Maskin has four levels of skills - A and B for rich countries, C and D for the poor.
After globalization, professionals D from poor countries lack the skills to co-operate with professionals A and B from rich countries.
And if level C workers from poor countries have increased their wages by cooperating with staff from rich B, then D-growth workers do not feel, or their wages are falling.
The outcome is that the internationalization of production will contribute to the widening of the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thus to the increase of inequality.
The Kremmer and E. Maskin have a very beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardo theory of comparative advantage.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, said Fouad Alekerov, a regular professor, head of the International Analysis and Decision-making Laboratory, head of the Department of Mathematics of the WSE.
And as a powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to an embryo in this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the means to do so, and the companies are not able to pay their fees.
In such a situation, Governments, international agencies, NCB and private foundations can play a significant role, according to Maskin.
The scientist notes that the theory is in no way calling for a halt to the process of globalization, which has brought and is bearing fruit in the form of GDP growth in countries.
Derbent: The living connection of time.
Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, is celebrating its 2000 anniversary in September.
In the event programme, the Dagestan National Cultures Festival and the past-style fair, the exhibition of derbaten carpets and the Day of Open temples, the historical and musical show "2000 in two hours" and the tours to the redesigned Petra I. Museum
The middle stones of the Narin-Kala fortress, the old Arab inscription on the walls, the narrow streets and the palace gardens, all as if it had come off the pages of "Thousands and one night."
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has remained in its place since the antiquities.
Although he was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantiya, Hazar Kaganat and the Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern platan, which is growing in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mosque, is a few centuries.
These powerful plants are protected by the entire Russian programme "The trees are the monuments of the wildlife."
The shadow of the rascal kroner saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The mosque's visitor will be given an aromatic tea and will be paid by the Dagestan lasomes - a copper figs, a hurma, a mushmula, a lupus-miracle, an iraan and a candy.
In Derbent, the centuries of death have been used by large-scale maids to have a cup of tea for many guests at one time.
The inscription on the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 Hijra.
I mean, in 733, on the Gregorian calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is struck by the magnitude and the enchantment: the arcades of the dome and the slots are based on square columns and are covered by the sun from small windows.
Pigs are a traditional concern for the people of Derbent.
The owners of the household birds put pigeons in the yards, under the trees, in the attic.
It's a great sight of a bunch of white pigeons, like a festive fireworks.
In defence of the enemy, the ancient peppers closed the Caspian gate with a double stone wall.
When it was 500 meters into the sea, the building was locked up by the Derbent harbor.
In 2003, the Derbent stronghold walls were included on the UNESCO World Heritage List as the most well-preserved monument of the ancient Persian fortifications.
The cows in Derbent were still in the V-century, and until now, the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
In one of the adjacent streets, carpets are sold for any taste - wool, cotton or all the colors and shade, with and without a wool, complex ornament, and a cunning rock.
The construction of the city began with shops - blocks with one-storey stone construction.
The shops have not changed much over the years.
Only satellite plates, air conditioners on the walls and street lights remind me that you are not in the middle of the century, but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, the parts of the water pipeline built by the feathers were retained about a thousand years ago.
Our days have come to come from ancient sources where the local people are still collecting water.
Many Derbents prefer common water from cranes to water from verified historical fountains.
There was one of the centres of the racing craft in Derbent.
The political and receipt vases, the dishes, the bowls, the cups were valued all over the Caucasus.
The hands of the racers are still making wonderful ceramic products for both practical and gift purposes.
On the days of the holidays and the festival, the crowd of the audience is gathered under a tight channel attended by the students of the Republican School of Zirzic Arts.
The history of an amazing and risky skill has been for centuries.
A new trend - more and more girls can be seen among Kanaks.
The ancient Derbent's culture and welfare museum is now operating at the office of the former Deli Bany.
In the past, unmarried girls and bridesmaids were washed up here, accompanied by a friend, and now anyone who wants to see a sophomore room, hot and cold basins that have gone into the past to bathe.
Most of Derbent's houses have hot water, but the baths and the guys are as popular today as they were in old times.
The benefits of the warm-up of the body are written in the old books.
After the baths, the blood is improved, the muscles are tired, the body is flexible and easy.
The "Commonwealth" festival, which takes place in the Narin-Kala fortress, is attended by ethnic groups in many parts of Dagestan.
Participants in national suits dance, play popular melody, perform the songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and buy visitors good domestic cheese.
Kirkhlar is the burial site of 40 martyrs who have laid their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most respected sets for the Muslims of the North Caucasus.
The then-yellow sarcophages have been removed from whole stone blocks and are, as is accepted by the Arabs, directed towards the West-East axis.
The Gavryl and Albert Yakubova brothers cut and shave clients in a small salon near the Upper Basar.
The hairdresser's been in this place for years.
The chirchings are transmitted from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Yakubova brothers can make not only traditional but also the most modern hair.
In one of the streets of the Old City, a house was maintained in which a decabrist writer, Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, lived.
After learning the Turkic language and gathering ethnographic material, he described Derbent of the first third of the 19th century with his ancient monuments, life and the people of the city.
Chaihana is a traditional club in the East where only tea and domestic baking are served.
Men come here to drown their thirst, talk to their friends, and solve some work problems.
As in past times, women are not encouraged to cross the Chaikhan threshold.
The Derbent dance ensemble "Caspian" was created three years ago, but has already been able to take part in national and Russian-level activities.
The members of the ensemble are rehearsed every day by teaching the people & apos; s avaras, Darghis, Tat and Armenian dance.
When the night comes, when the noise is on and the street lights are on, the local people are placed on the shops near the houses with the terrasas.
As a general rule, the Derbentans discuss domestic issues.
But in the run-up to the anniversary, they are increasingly reminded of the unique history of their city, which has affected the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
There was a business "airport game" in Domodov.
In the capital, there is a new form of education.
Four hundred students tried as airport staff.
To that end, three air harbours were set up in Domodov.
Young people not only searched and registered passengers, but also maintained aircraft.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but it was difficult to give up on reality.
The late flights, two passengers with fractures on board, were lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For a real airport, it's hell.
For the one who's based in the Domodov hangar, it's a standard set of tasks to be done by the newcomers.
One hangar had three major airports from around the world.
There are currently four hundred students from the capital colleges and higher education institutions.
It's an unprecedented chance to learn all about the air harbor's inner world.
The registration of passengers, the maintenance of fixed-wing aircraft, the movement of baggage - even the buses on the summer field, the stairs and the search of passengers were entrusted to them.
And the passengers are all troubled.
One of them is in bad order with the documents, the other is late for the flight, the other is filling the bag with suspicious items.
And we need to deal with all this, like in life, on a minimum date.
Each of these tasks is subject to a certain amount, virtual money, as if the airline had paid them for the maintenance of the flight.
"A fine is imposed on them for failure to do so," explains in an interview to the Vesti-Moscow programme the financial analyst of the Dmitri Hilco game.
This is being closely monitored by officials from the Ministry of Education.
For them, this test is an attempt to try a new form of education.
She's already found a place in secondary vocational education.
"Six interregional centres of competence will be established, which will in fact be new models for modern colleges with modern management, highly qualified staff, modern equipment," by Natalia Zolotarev, Director of the Department of State Policy for the Training of Workers and Additional Vocational Education of the Ministry of Foreign Science of the Russian Federation.
But students don't have a global plan.
After three days of training, they might need a day off.
The estimates for this examination were, however, quite material.
The new smartglasses, the best I've ever seen!

The US Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret at the closure of the United States Foreign Literature Library.
The Centre has been working in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The US Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the US Embassy Centre at the All-Russian State Library of M.I. Rudomino in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent times have called into question the commitment of the Russian Government to the relations between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been interrupted even during the cold war and at other difficult moments of the long history of our countries' relations," stated in the statement by Ambassador John Teft of the United States of America to the Interfax.
The American Centre has created deep and strong links between human beings and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital and also served as a venue for meetings with numerous American eminent persons, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Last year alone, the American Centre held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50,000 Russian visitors," the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that a decision had been taken about a year ago to close another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program) education exchange programme.
The Green Tribunal was found to be swift at the end of the day.
The typical situation is that four officials stand before the table of Judge Swatander Kumar, hearing his claims about the work done.
The court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We did not give you a 110-page order to make you feel better about him, "Kumar says."
If there's any other brick, we'll order you to take down all the existing structures.
Kumar is the head of the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial body established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution of the environment, accompanied by the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has been able to deal with more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are extremely high: in the short 60 years since the independence of the strengthened industrial development, India has become one of the most overpopulated and contaminated countries in the world from the country of the virgin jungle.
The major megacities are particularly serious, where infrastructure development does not keep pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense resin, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and few of the remaining housing areas are being rebuilt into new residential areas.
Despite the formal support of the State for the green movement, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it is often the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May this year, for example, the Minister of the Environment called the court's decisions "extreme" and "impossible."
Sometimes it is indeed impossible to fulfil the court & apos; s decision within the court & apos; s time limit, as confirmed by Raj Panjwani & apos; s environmental counsel.
However, the unfulfilled dedlains have a positive side: at least they force those responsible to move.
"His main purpose is to shake this system," added by counsel.
The Green Tribunal has on several occasions abolished large buildings: the closure of the airport, the power plant and hundreds of smaller facilities.
People are also being tried to remember: for example, during a discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the State of Telangana, which contaminated the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we're also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," he commented on Kumar's decision.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can be changed by a single sketch of a judge.
In April, for example, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, which was a public outrage.
Despite a sharp fall in popularity and criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to rescind this decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Government of New Delhi on the entry and exit of vehicles, and he also proposed the purchase of 10,000 additional buses, with prior recognition in factories of whether they were able to carry out such an order.
As the sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even traffic incidents began to fall into the scope of the ship's attention, popular anger began to blur a little.
But the most painful subject of the judge of principle was the Gang River clean-up programme, which was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Gang, the Hindus' sacred river, the judge often ceases to hold his emotions and goes to scream.
You know what the word "saint" means?
Some have poured water from Gang into the statue of God, and there are faeces in it, and the judge is hot.
You continue to pollute the river because you think that Gang is Gang, he will take all of our sins.
It's a river that we worship, and look what you do to it every day.
The clearance of Gang is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new Government.
The number of fecal bacteria in this river is now more than 120 times higher.
Every year, between 1.5 and 3 of the 700 million Hindus who are bathing in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Gang Rescue Fund money from the sale of his suit, where he met with Barack Obama and 455 other items from his personal collection.
The ecologists immediately accused the premiere of populism: the suit was bought for $700,000, while at least eight billion is required to clean the river.
The members of the Green Tribunal agree that India has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but do not believe that the cost of progress should be environmental.
"In a developing country, environmental talk is often perceived as a disallowed luxury," said the activist of Zov Ganga, Malika Bhanot. "
And the court is trying to find a golden middle between environment and development. "

Xi Jinping calls for a more open economy for the world
The economy must become more open to the world in order to boost its growth, as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday, in addressing a group that has the task of leading the reforms.
"China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop a policy of openness," he said, in addressing the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Steering Group on Comprehensive Reform.
He said that increasing openness and deepening reforms would give the economy new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including the regulation of investor access to the market, the amendment of border controls, the promotion of public enterprises (SOE) that attract private capital and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be phased out through pilot programmes.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a greater role in resource allocation, business law and transparency, as stated in the statement.
The Government will also reduce control over the powers granted to companies, thereby ensuring that companies are self-employed.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to develop new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for strengthening local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors to increase the openness of State-controlled sectors of the economy.
"The Government will not change its policy on foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-financing companies and provide them with better conditions," the statement states.
The procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or "green card," will be further facilitated by streamlining the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Lee Ketzan and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended.
